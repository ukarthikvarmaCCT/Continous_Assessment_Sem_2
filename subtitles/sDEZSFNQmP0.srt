00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,930
Hello, friends.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,813
It has been more than 1 month since the Hindenburg Report was published.

3
00:00:03,813 --> 00:00:08,590
Even now, new allegations are being levied against the Adani Group one after the other.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,996
A few days ago, Wikipedia accused the Adani Group

5
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:16,105
Of manipulating the Wikipedia pages

6
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:20,403
By using fake accounts and undeclared paid editors.

7
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:23,438
Before this, it was discussed in Parliament as well

8
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:25,135
When Congress leader Rahul Gandhi

9
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:26,809
And TMC leader Mahua Moitra

10
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:28,976
Questioned Prime Minister Modi

11
00:00:28,976 --> 00:00:32,020
About his alleged relationship with Adani.

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,193
A photo was presented at the Parliament

13
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:36,100
Of Prime Minister Modi with Adani,

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,065
Which caused a lot of uproars

15
00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:42,389
And later, Rahul Gandhi’s remarks were removed from Parliament records.

16
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:43,960
What were the accusations?

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,744
How true are they?

18
00:00:45,744 --> 00:00:48,539
Come, in this video, let’s try to figure it out.

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,109
“Mr Adani and Mr Modi, are in it together.”

20
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:53,609
“The person whose planes PM Modi uses to travel,

21
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:56,384
The person whose fundings run BJP.”

22
00:00:56,384 --> 00:01:00,251
“A slew of deals across sectors from defence to airports to power,

23
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:02,361
Almost always went to the Adani group.”

24
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:05,049
“All of the funds are going to one person.”

25
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:08,654
“What is his relationship with India’s Prime Minister?”

26
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:11,052
Before beginning this video,

27
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:12,781
It’s important to mention one thing.

28
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:17,334
This isn’t the first time that a corporate group is facing severe allegations.

29
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:19,905
Before this, we witnessed the Harshad Mehta Scam,

30
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:21,871
Satyam Scam, Sahara Scam.

31
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:25,624
Allegations on Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi,

32
00:01:25,624 --> 00:01:27,516
Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi.

33
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:30,377
Putting aside corporate groups and individuals,

34
00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:33,739
Such accusations have been levied on the previous governments too.

35
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:35,381
The Congress government had to face the

36
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:37,728
Bofors Scam, Augusta Westland Scam,

37
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:40,422
2G Spectrum Scam, Commonwealth Scam.

38
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:44,433
But what’s happening now, has perhaps never happened in the history of the nation.

39
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:47,189
This is the first time, that in an alleged scam,

40
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,792
Public money was lost,

41
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:50,647
But a faction of the people has come forward

42
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:52,920
Not to demand an investigation

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,702
But rather to defend the company and government.

44
00:01:56,702 --> 00:02:00,440
A trend is created on Twitter #IStandWithAdani.

45
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,686
These people who’re supporting Adani,

46
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:09,283
Had they been Adani’s employees or investors,

47
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:11,164
It would have been understandable to a large extent.

48
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:16,059
But a significant of them are neither employees nor stockholders of Adani,

49
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:19,566
Even so, they are at the front line to defend Adani.

50
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:22,600
Can you imagine someone running a trend of

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,058
#IStandWithVijayMallya for Vijay Mallya’s case?

52
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:28,804
Imagine someone defending the Commonwealth Games

53
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:30,854
Saying that there should be no investigation into it.

54
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:33,441
There should be no questions as no wrong was done.

55
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:36,327
This is why, friends, I believe that the biggest scam here

56
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:38,446
Is being done with the people’s minds.

57
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:43,014
Basic logic, common sense, and the basic understanding of democracy

58
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:44,222
Has been trampled over.

59
00:02:44,222 --> 00:02:46,499
They say that Adani shouldn’t be questioned

60
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,591
Because Adani is an Indian businessman.

61
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:50,977
That Adani group provides so many jobs.

62
00:02:50,977 --> 00:02:53,145
That they have contributed to the development of India.

63
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:54,875
Does this make any sense?

64
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,017
For some basic understanding, let’s try to understand

65
00:02:57,017 --> 00:02:59,528
The contribution of the Adani Group.

66
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:00,788
Let’s look at the jobs.

67
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:03,469
Adani was the richest person in India once.

68
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:04,900
Asia’s richest person,

69
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,087
In fact, the second richest person in the world.

70
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:11,270
Then his net worth was ₹12.44 TRILLION!

71
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,150
After the Hindenburg report,

72
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,968
The net worth has significantly decreased,

73
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:16,903
But even now, at the time of shooting this video,

74
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:21,120
According to Bloomberg, his Net Worth is said to be ₹4.3 Trillion.

75
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,425
Such a wealthy man.

76
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:23,978
With so many companies under his control.

77
00:03:23,978 --> 00:03:28,236
So his companies must be employing millions of people, right?

78
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:29,747
You might think that.

79
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:32,291
But according to Adani’s official website,

80
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,810
The Adani Group employs about 23,000 people.

81
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,542
Only 23,000 jobs.

82
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:40,154
But you might feel that it isn't a fair comparison

83
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:42,908
And that we should compare it to other private companies only,

84
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:43,940
So let's do that.

85
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,488
The number 1 private company that to provide the most number of jobs in India

86
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:49,369
are the Tata Group of companies.

87
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:50,776
More than 900,000 jobs.

88
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:52,746
Then comes Infosys, with more than 300,000 jobs.

89
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:55,371
Reliance Industries provides 236,000 jobs.

90
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:57,316
Wipro provides 231,000 jobs.

91
00:03:57,316 --> 00:04:01,503
Adani's companies do not appear even in the List of Top 25.

92
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:04,375
Take the government company Coal India,

93
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,512
That has 272,445 employees.

94
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,562
Indian Railways, 1.25 million employees.

95
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:14,262
A company like Amul provides livelihood to ₹3.6 million farmers.

96
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:17,870
Overall, Indian Agriculture employs more than 150 million people.

97
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,031
When you look at the numbers,

98
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:22,285
Adani Group doesn’t make a significant contribution to providing jobs in India.

99
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:23,880
Second, even if not in terms of jobs,

100
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,976
They would have made a large contribution to the taxes,

101
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:27,524
Since they have such a large Net Worth.

102
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:29,342
Take a look at this list compiled by Business Today

103
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:32,797
Of India’s Top 10 taxpaying companies.

104
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:35,430
At the top is Reliance followed by SBI, TCS,

105
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,191
HDFC, Vedanta, JSW Steel,

106
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:41,709
Indian Oil Corporation, Tata Steel, ICICI, LIC.

107
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:44,222
We don’t spot Adani on it.

108
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:45,705
Several people pointed this out,

109
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:47,690
Companies of India’s richest person

110
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,483
Aren’t among the Top 10 taxpayer companies.

111
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:51,884
How could this be?

112
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:53,832
An explanation for this can be

113
00:04:53,832 --> 00:04:56,154
That tax is levied on profit.

114
00:04:56,154 --> 00:04:58,012
Not on Net Worth.

115
00:04:58,012 --> 00:04:59,911
So let’s take a look at the profits.

116
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:01,584
According to MoneyControl.com

117
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:05,739
Profit of Adani Enterprises for 12 months as on March 2022,

118
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,900
Was ₹11.13 Billion.

119
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,559
Don’t you think this is suspicious?

120
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,874
The amount of tax paid by the other companies

121
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:16,127
Is more than the profit made by Adani.

122
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:18,148
If the business isn’t very profitable,

123
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:20,106
Why do they have such high valuations?

124
00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:22,874
Did these companies make any groundbreaking innovations?

125
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:26,409
Or did they create any heavily used technology?

126
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,320
Similar to companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Tesla.

127
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,000
That doesn’t seem like the case.

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,224
So why?

129
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:35,303
Perhaps the answer is hidden in the accusations.

130
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:39,059
Come, let’s look at the new allegations one by one.

131
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:42,320
Especially the allegations from the Indian Parliament.

132
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,373
The first allegation is of a Land Scam.

133
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:48,082
This was when Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.

134
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:53,023
Back then, various industrial groups needed land in Gujarat for their projects

135
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,372
So they bought land there.

136
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:59,272
K Raheja Corp bought land at ₹470/m².

137
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:04,359
Maruti Suzuki got land at ₹670/m².

138
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:09,479
Ford India, Tata Motors, and TCS paid ₹1,100/m².

139
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,247
Torrent Power had to pay ₹6,000/m².

140
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,423
But when Adani purchased land to build a port,

141
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:19,709
They were given the land at a mere ₹32/m².

142
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:20,808
This was the maximum.

143
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:23,840
In places, the price was as low as ₹1/m².

144
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,642
I’m not making this up.

145
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:29,633
This is the headline of the Business Standard article from 26th April 2014,

146
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:35,465
So there’s an accusation of a land scam.

147
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:37,433
After this, in April 2015,

148
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:40,110
CAG presented its report to the Gujarat Assembly.

149
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,130
They claimed that the Gujarat government did not classify forest land correctly.

150
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:52,871
Due to this, the “Goutam Adani-promoted Mundra Port” benefitted by ₹586.4 million.

151
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,166
This happened in 2008-09.

152
00:06:55,166 --> 00:07:00,331
After this, in 2022, the Public Accounts Committee reiterated the same thing.

153
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:03,973
They said that the land was supposed to be classified as Eco Class-2,

154
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:06,611
But it was classified as Eco Class-4,

155
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:11,075
Which led to the government losing ₹586.7 million.

156
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:13,017
The government losing money means

157
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,499
The loss of public funds.

158
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:18,031
The second accusation is the misutilisation of forest land.

159
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:21,164
Narendra Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister in 2014,

160
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:25,248
And look at this report in The Times of India from 24th October 2014.

161
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:30,242
Centre clears 370-acre forest land for Adani’s coal-based thermal power plant.

162
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,000
This was in Maharastra.

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,044
After this, in 2018, 142 acres of land was further sanctioned.

164
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:40,546
This time by both the Central and State government.

165
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:43,335
Both were headed by BJP at the time.

166
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:45,585
The forest department responded by saying that

167
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:49,496
The forest land demanded by them was the barest minimum

168
00:07:49,496 --> 00:07:52,618
And that giving this land would eventually lead to an increase in employment.

169
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:54,343
You’ll ask about the particulars of employment.

170
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:56,690
They claimed that 100 local residents will get jobs,

171
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,212
And indirectly, 250 residents.

172
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,080
350 jobs in total.

173
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,657
In March 2018,

174
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:04,977
Adani Group received 'in-principle' approval

175
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:09,206
for using about 1,550 hectares of forest land.

176
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:11,863
For the Mundra Special Economic Zone.

177
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:14,354
Regarding this, the Forest Advisory Committee said that

178
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:18,728
most of the forest land would be used for non-forestry purposes.

179
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:21,485
The third accusation is of the Airport Scam.

180
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:23,570
In November 2018,

181
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,816
The Cabinet approved the privatisation of 6 airports.

182
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:31,257
Here, the privatisation of airports is a big deal on its own.

183
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:33,169
Questions need to be asked

184
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,638
The profitable airports that were making money for the government

185
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:39,404
Why were they privatised?

186
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:43,110
As long as a profitable organisation is under the government's control,

187
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,054
Its profit goes to the government.

188
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:47,256
That can be later used for public welfare.

189
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:49,369
But if it is privatised,

190
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:52,597
Its profits would go to the corporate company.

191
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,054
Only that company would benefit.

192
00:08:54,054 --> 00:08:55,919
Earlier the excuse was that

193
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,885
The loss-making public companies

194
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,264
are being privatised.

195
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:01,234
Well, it's understandable if it is loss-making.

196
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:03,204
But take the example of ONGC,

197
00:09:03,204 --> 00:09:05,816
In Financial Year 2021-22

198
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:09,130
It recorded a Net Profit of ₹400 billion.

199
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,472
It became India's second-most profitable company after Reliance Industries.

200
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:15,956
Even so, the government directed ONGC

201
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,281
to privatise oil and gas fields.

202
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:20,501
Anyway, this is a major issue on its own right.

203
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:22,866
For now, let's stick to the privatisation of the airports,

204
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:25,496
in November 2018, a committee was formed.

205
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:27,957
Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee.

206
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:30,262
This committee was tasked with deciding the criteria

207
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:32,751
To whom the airports should be given after the privatisation.

208
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:34,651
This committee made 2 decisions.

209
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:38,028
First, any company purchasing these airports

210
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:40,964
Need not have any previous experience in this field.

211
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:43,410
And second, there is no restriction on

212
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,829
The number of airports, one company could bid for.

213
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:50,477
After this, all 6 airports, went to Adani.

214
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:54,793
Adani companies had no previous experience managing an airport. 

215
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:57,854
Friends, it is now reported that when this happened,

216
00:09:57,854 --> 00:10:01,437
The Finance Ministry and NITI Aayog had raised concerns against this.

217
00:10:01,437 --> 00:10:04,540
They said that this would be a big financial risk.

218
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,783
To handover the airports to a bidder

219
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:09,998
With no previous experience in handling airports,

220
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:11,779
could cause performance issues.

221
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,302
The quality of services could be compromised.

222
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:16,929
But these objections were overruled.

223
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:19,384
And Adani got 6 airports.

224
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:21,943
In the same category as this alleged Airport Scam

225
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:23,734
is another alleged scam.

226
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,403
The hijacking of the Mumbai Airport.

227
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:27,789
I am not making up these allegations.

228
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:31,144
These allegations were raised by opposition leaders in Parliament.

229
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:34,260
The only reason you don't know about these in detail

230
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,335
is because the media doesn't discuss these.

231
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:41,071
Mumbai airport was under the control of GVK Group.

232
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:42,926
On 28th July 2020,

233
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:45,337
The Enforcement Directorate raided

234
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:48,832
the Mumbai and Hyderabad offices of the GVK Group.

235
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:52,352
Additionally, the office of Mumbai International Airport Limited was raided.

236
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:56,452
It was a joint venture managing the airport.

237
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:58,677
About 1 month after this raid,

238
00:10:58,677 --> 00:11:00,830
On 1st September 2020,

239
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,505
 Adani Group acquired a 74% stake

240
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:06,998
of Mumbai International Airport.

241
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:10,505
Of this 74% stake, 50.5% stake

242
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:12,090
was previously held by the GVK Group

243
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,934
that is completely held by Adani now.

244
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:17,161
The question arose if this was a coincidence or collusion.

245
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,911
"GVK was pressured by

246
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:22,462
the Indian Government, 

247
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:25,601
to hand over the airport to Mr Adani."

248
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,141
In December 2021,

249
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:31,253
Minister of State for Civil Aviation General V. K. Singh

250
00:11:31,253 --> 00:11:32,825
Told the Rajya Sabha that

251
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:36,555
of the total 8 airports under public-private partnership,

252
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:40,355
7 airports are run by Adani Enterprises.

253
00:11:40,355 --> 00:11:41,795
In March 2022,

254
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:46,413
SBI underwrites the debt owed by Adani's Navi Mumbai airport.

255
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:49,352
The debt of ₹127.70 billion.

256
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:51,673
You would ask about the meaning of underwriting.

257
00:11:51,673 --> 00:11:54,150
So come look at the dictionary definition of it.

258
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,385
It means that the banks provide financial support

259
00:12:05,385 --> 00:12:07,135
and take responsibility

260
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:10,063
of bearing the cost if the company fails.

261
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,972
This could be considered a Golden Offer.

262
00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:14,596
The 4th allegation here

263
00:12:14,596 --> 00:12:16,284
was the alleged Coal Scam.

264
00:12:16,284 --> 00:12:18,519
Opposition leaders have alleged that

265
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:21,685
when Prime Minister Modi goes on a tour of foreign countries,

266
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:23,826
he doesn't work for India's benefit.

267
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,884
He works for Adani's benefit.

268
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:28,060
"He travels with you on your delegations.

269
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,435
He meets heads of states on visits to India.

270
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:33,206
He portrays that India is the Prime Minister,

271
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:34,748
And the Prime Minister is him.

272
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:36,305
He makes it appear to the world that

273
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:38,670
he is the remote control behind the Prime Minister.

274
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,199
And by obliging him, we'll be obliging the Prime Minister." 

275
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:45,443
Interestingly, such allegations aren't raised by opposition leaders only.

276
00:12:45,443 --> 00:12:48,334
Instead, some BJP leaders are doing the same.

277
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,609
BJP leader Subramanian Swamy

278
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:52,329
shared a chronology.

279
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:56,120
Our research team verified whether these news articles were correct.

280
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,036
They're correct.

281
00:12:57,036 --> 00:12:58,311
Listen to the chronology.

282
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,650
December 2021,

283
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:04,771
Adani Group started exporting coals from its Australian coal mines.

284
00:13:05,454 --> 00:13:09,015
Climate activists had protested against this coal mines previously.

285
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:10,278
May 2022,

286
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:14,234
the Indian government slashes the import duty on coal.

287
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:17,734
From 2.5% to 0%.

288
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:19,005
June 2022,

289
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:20,930
the Modi government directed Coal India,

290
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,894
to be prepared for importing 12 million tonnes of coal.

291
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:26,742
June 2022,

292
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:31,270
NTPC awards coal import tenders of ₹83 billion 

293
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,946
to Adani Enterprises.

294
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,730
Coincidence? or Collusion?

295
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,409
Subramanian Swamy missed 2 imported reports.

296
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,049
May 2022, in India power plants, were allowed

297
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:43,445
the use of blended coal

298
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:45,971
that contains 30% of imported coal,

299
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:47,623
until March of next year,

300
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:49,694
without the consent of the buyer states.

301
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:53,132
On 26th May, an emergency coal blending order was passed regarding this,

302
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,690
under Section 11 of the Electricity Act.

303
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,026
In July, Congress leader Gaurav Vallabh,

304
00:13:59,026 --> 00:14:01,483
raised concern about this.

305
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:04,737
Claiming that the government is working for the benefit of its friends. 

306
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:08,659
August 2022, this order was retracted.

307
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,470
But in January 2023,

308
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,087
the central government directed the power generation companies

309
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:15,290
to use the blend of imported coal,

310
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,236
up to 6% of their requirement till September.

311
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:21,466
In this story, I missed out on a major point.

312
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:24,026
Government officials had told the Indian Express,

313
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:27,744
that the domestic coal procured from India,

314
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:31,192
costs around ₹1,700-₹2,000 per tonne.

315
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:33,932
But the coal imported by Adani,

316
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:37,829
costs around ₹17,000 to ₹20,000 per tonne.

317
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:39,953
Goes to show that when public-sector companies

318
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:42,675
are being directed to use imported coal,

319
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,772
they have to pay ten times the costs.

320
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:48,318
If you want to know about previously alleged scams in detail,

321
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:50,400
such as the alleged 2G spectrum scam,

322
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,783
commonwealth scam,

323
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:53,860
What happened in those scams exactly?

324
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,965
Why are they known as scams?

325
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:58,718
I recommend that you listen to this audiobook on KUKU FM,

326
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:00,171

339
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,162
Here, I'd like to thank KUKU FM for sponsoring this video.

340
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,271
And now, let's get back to the topic.

341
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:34,478
Let's look at another chronology,

342
00:15:34,478 --> 00:15:35,772
related to Sri Lanka.

343
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:37,082
May 2019,

344
00:15:37,082 --> 00:15:39,388
the governments of India, Japan, and Sri Lanka,

345
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:41,868
signed a Memorandum of Cooperation,

346
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:45,076
for the development of the East Container Terminal.

347
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:46,234
At the Columbo Port.

348
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:47,636
Quite commendable.

349
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:49,077
February 2021,

350
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:53,465
Sri Lanka cancels this ECT agreement from 2019.

351
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:56,253
India and Japan weren't happy with this.

352
00:15:56,253 --> 00:15:58,238
The next month, March 2021,

353
00:15:58,238 --> 00:16:00,086
Sri Lanka changed the terminal.

354
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:02,064
Instead of the East Container Terminal,

355
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:03,357
the West Container Terminal.

356
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:07,991
But then it says that it will be a joint public-private partnership project.

357
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:11,063
Between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority

358
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:13,623
and Adani Ports and SEZ.

359
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:15,793
In a press release, the Sri Lankan government stated that

360
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:17,947
Their cabinet-appointed negotiation committee

361
00:16:17,947 --> 00:16:20,184
had requested the Indian High Commission

362
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:22,978
and the Japanese Embassy to nominate investors.

363
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:25,465
Japan did not nominate any investor

364
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:29,892
While the Indian high commission gave approval to Adani ports and SEZ.

365
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:32,418
This isn’t the only foreign project which went to Adani.

366
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:34,296
There are numerous such contracts,

367
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:37,195
Related to ports, defence, electricity,

368
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:39,622
In countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Israel,

369
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:41,041
That were awarded to Adani.

370
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,944
TMC leader Mahua Moitra claims,

371
00:16:42,944 --> 00:16:46,287
That Adani travels with Prime Minister Modi

372
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:47,768
on his foreign tours,

373
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:49,558
meets other heads of states,

374
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:51,908
and has created an impression that

375
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:55,490
he is the remote control managing PM Modi.

376
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,042
The next major accusation is of Tax Evasion.

377
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:03,044
Look at this notice, issued by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence,

378
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:05,213
Dated 15th May 2014,

379
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:10,315
Several such Show Cause Notices were issued to the Adani Group

380
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:13,298
Alleging that the Group evades paying taxes.

381
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,709
They have not paid taxes properly

382
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,232
To the total amount of ₹10 billion, approximately.

383
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:22,415
There were allegations of using a shell company

384
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:26,714
And hundreds of millions of dollar were transferred among companies

385
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,228
And sent to tax havens

386
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:30,809
So that taxes could be avoided.

387
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:35,729
But in August 2017, the adjudicating authority of DRI, KVS Singh

388
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:40,313
Dropped all charges raised by this agency.

389
00:17:40,313 --> 00:17:42,354
The ones levied against Adani Power Maharashtra Limited

390
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,066
And Adani Power Rajasthan Limited.

391
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:48,622
The allegations were that the goods imported by them,

392
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:50,807
Were shown at an inflated value.

393
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:54,728
They were talking about approx ₹39 billion.

394
00:17:54,728 --> 00:17:57,760
In February 2018, the Customs department claimed

395
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,983
That those orders were wrong, illegal, and improper.

396
00:18:00,983 --> 00:18:04,803
In 2017, the documents that were leaked to EPW indicate that

397
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:09,479
Adani Power did not pay the duty on Raw Materials and Consumables

398
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:12,807
Which amounted to approximately ₹10 billion.

399
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:15,552
After this, the next allegation is loan-related.

400
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:19,488
In September 2022, when Adani’s wealth was at an all-time high,

401
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:23,372
The loans owed by Adani Group touched all-time highs too.

402
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:25,649
₹2.2 TRILLION!

403
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:29,403
On 30th January, in an interview by Adani Group’s CFO,

404
00:18:29,403 --> 00:18:31,166
To CNBC TV18,

405
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:36,037
He stated that the total debt of the Adani Group is at $30 billion.

406
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:38,510
Now, $1 is around ₹82.

407
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,085
So $1 billion is about ₹82 billion.

408
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:44,178
So approximately, this is around ₹2.48 trillion.

409
00:18:44,178 --> 00:18:48,156
Of this, around ₹740 billion

410
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:50,471
approximately is owed to Indian Banks.

411
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:53,264
From the disclosures made by banks, we see that

412
00:18:53,264 --> 00:18:56,785
Adani Group owes ₹400 billion to SBI,

413
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:59,398
₹70 billion to PNB,

414
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:03,873
Bank of Baroda declined to openly disclose the amount owed,

415
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:06,024
But according to LiveMint’s report,

416
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:09,825
It is calculated to be around ₹53.8 billion.

417
00:19:09,825 --> 00:19:12,779
These are national, public-sector banks,

418
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:20,794
And one company owes around ₹523.8 billion to these banks.

419
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:24,836
Another allegation related to the loans is of loan write-off.

420
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:29,279
The Indian Express filed an RTI in which they were told by RBI that

421
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,726
In the last 5 years, the banks have written off about ₹10 trillion worth of loans.

422
00:19:34,726 --> 00:19:40,186
Write-offs do not mean that the banks will stop trying to recover this money, 

423
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:45,683
But the banks have recovered only about ₹1.32 trillion of this money till now.

424
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:48,162
That amounts to about only 13% of the write-offs.

425
00:19:48,162 --> 00:19:54,103
In 2018 and 2021, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy accused the Adani Group

426
00:19:54,103 --> 00:19:56,803
Of being an NPA trapeze artist.

427
00:19:56,803 --> 00:19:58,817
NPA refers to Bad Loans.

428
00:19:58,817 --> 00:20:01,755
Adani countered these allegations by claiming that

429
00:20:01,755 --> 00:20:05,049
The Adani Group does not have any NPAs.

430
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
The next accusation was regarding Shell Companies.

431
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,681
Mahua Moitra talked about Mauritius-based shell companies.

432
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:12,083
“His group companies have amassed nearly

433
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,559
₹42,000 crores [₹420 billion] in Foreign Portfolio Investments

434
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,190
From 6 Mauritius-based funds.

435
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,056
These funds have commonalities,

436
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:21,210
Like common address, common company secretary, and common directors.”

437
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,441
She asked why this wasn’t invested back in 2019

438
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:27,910
When she raised the issue in Parliament.

439
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,056
“There’s an urgent need to investigate these funds.

440
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:32,680
I brought this up in this house in 2019.”

441
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,278
She mentioned another 40 shell companies

442
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:37,993
That invested in the Adani Group.

443
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:41,349
She said that the funds were managed by Adani’s brother

444
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:44,748
And a Chinese individual Chang Chung-Ling,

445
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:47,237
DRI records reveal that

446
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:49,595
Chang Chung-Ling and Vinod Adani,

447
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:51,875
Share the same residential address.

448
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,624
Adani Group hasn’t commented on this allegation.

449
00:20:55,624 --> 00:20:57,927
The list of accusations is very long, friends.

450
00:20:57,927 --> 00:21:00,331
The allegations which I listed out now,

451
00:21:00,331 --> 00:21:01,623
Are far from over.

452
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:05,706
If I start listing every allegation, this will stretch into a 2-hour long video.

453
00:21:05,706 --> 00:21:08,689
For now, let’s see what happened next.

454
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:12,003
Opposition talked about this in Parliament.

455
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:13,741
They demanded a JPC.

456
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:16,135
To create a Join Parliamentary Committee to

457
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:19,013
conduct an investigation into the allegations.

458
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:20,931
How did BJP respond to this?

459
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,306
BJP asked for proof.

460
00:21:23,306 --> 00:21:24,917
Proof for the allegations.

461
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,735
I don’t understand, what proof do they need further?

462
00:21:27,735 --> 00:21:31,019
These news articles on these allegations

463
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:32,952
Are publicly available.

464
00:21:32,952 --> 00:21:37,010
Was land not given to Adani at dirt-cheap rates?

465
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:41,762
If this was indeed wrong, why doesn’t BJP reveal the rates at which the land was given to Adani?

466
00:21:41,762 --> 00:21:43,331
And if there was no land allocation,

467
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:45,364
Then BJP can say that no land was sold.

468
00:21:45,364 --> 00:21:48,068
Were rules changed for these 6 airports?

469
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:51,762
Was an order not passed to force power generators

470
00:21:51,762 --> 00:21:55,406
to fulfil 10% of their need by imported coal?

471
00:21:55,406 --> 00:22:00,005
Did they not purchase imported coal at 10 times the price of domestic coal?

472
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:02,755
If not, then they can tell us the price it was procured at.

473
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:06,274
What did Prime Minister Modi have to say in response to these allegations?

474
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:11,517
He asked why Rahul Gandhi doesn’t use Nehru’s surname.

475
00:22:11,517 --> 00:22:12,715
I’m not kidding.

476
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:15,986
This was the actual response of Prime Minister Modi in Parliament.

477
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:18,813
“I still do not understand

478
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,184
why people from his lineage

479
00:22:23,184 --> 00:22:26,954
Are afraid of using Nehru as their surname.”

480
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,355
The reason is that Rahul Gandhi’s surname

481
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:31,922
Is that of his grandfather.

482
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:34,700
His grandfather, Feroze Jahangir Gandhy.

483
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,335
A freedom fighter.

484
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:39,993
His surname was spelled Gandhy.

485
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:41,746
During the freedom movement

486
00:22:41,746 --> 00:22:44,424
He was very inspired by Mahatma Gandhi.

487
00:22:44,424 --> 00:22:46,588
Even before getting married to Indira Nehru,

488
00:22:46,588 --> 00:22:50,224
He had changed his surname to Gandhi.

489
00:22:50,224 --> 00:22:51,879
Replaced Y with an I.

490
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:54,248
This is why Jawaharlal Nehru’s daughter’s name

491
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,612
Changed from Indira Nehru to Indira Gandhi,

492
00:22:56,612 --> 00:22:59,994
And her sons, grandsons, granddaughters,

493
00:22:59,994 --> 00:23:02,067
Use the same surname.

494
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:04,974
But I believe, if it is becoming such an important issue

495
00:23:04,974 --> 00:23:08,860
That it hinders investigation into alleged scams,

496
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,461
I will request Rahul Gandhi

497
00:23:11,461 --> 00:23:12,952
To please change his surname.

498
00:23:12,952 --> 00:23:14,861
To change his name to Rahul Nehru,

499
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:18,260
So that there can be smooth investigations.

500
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,656
What do you think friends?

501
00:23:19,656 --> 00:23:20,867
Major allegations.

502
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,218
Severe allegations.

503
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:25,912
With documents to verify these allegations,

504
00:23:25,912 --> 00:23:28,837
But on the other hand, there is no response.

505
00:23:28,837 --> 00:23:30,859
Let alone starting an investigation,

506
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:33,540
There is no demand for an investigation.

507
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,868
Media maintains its silence

508
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:38,939
And when someone tries to speak up on social media,

509
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:41,467
They either run Adani’s biography

510
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,131
Or the trend #IStandWithAdani.

511
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:46,702
Can you imagine this even happening before in India’s history?

512
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,600
Thank you very much!
