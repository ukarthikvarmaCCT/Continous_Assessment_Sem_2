69
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:38,605
here is nothing its only covering

70
00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:41,985

aside this we have waranty and safety information

75
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:57,015
along with this here is charger

76
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:59,995
so here is its charger

77
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:02,815

78
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:05,875
here is a round proprietary pin

79
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,235
so this is its charger there is nothing more inside the box

80
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:12,285
So lets talk about this thing which is

81
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,325
Google home

82
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:17,385
basically it was a smart speaker in which there was a inbuilt

83
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:18,385
Google assistant

84
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:20,825
just connect it by your networy

85
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:23,665
and place it anywhere in your home and shout OK Google

86
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:25,785
and ask whatever your question is

87
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,345
and it will answer you by its voice

88
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:32,105
and voice will came from here it has speakers below

89
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,115
and other than this here are some smart microphones

90
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:38,265
and this part is made up of some fabric

91
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:40,965
and you can purchase it in other colours

92
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:43,855
according to your furniture

93
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:46,955
it will lock magnetically

94
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:50,435
if ill talk about buttons so here is a mute button

95
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:53,585
when you dosent want that google hear your voice just click on this

96
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,595
there are some microphones also one here some at upside

97
00:04:56,595 --> 00:05:00,055
on this area some lights also comes

98
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:03,145
and it was also a touch pad to control volume etc.

99
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:06,195
and here is area for charger

100
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:09,205
basically it was not a charger it was a adapter

101
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:11,905
cause you have to plug in it all the time for that here is a socket

102
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:15,135
so this is all about physical features of google home , lets set it

103
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,640
for that i have to download google home app in my mobile

104
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,140
and then we will do some fun questions with google home

105
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,160
To get started

106
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,960
Install the google home app on your phone or tablet

107
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:29,105
app was downloaded just click on setup

108
00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:32,165
lets say yes to this

109
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,085
as im a user of assistant so automatically system of Hey google and Ok googl

110
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,335
came automatically and it was setting up

111
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:40,385
and it was doing all process by its own and i like the light button which was on upside of google home

112
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:43,645
cause all dots are multicolored and they keep rounding

113
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:46,025
and from here i can set volume

114
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:47,495
it was maximun

115
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:49,075
and

116
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:52,255
now it came at lowest point so it was a touchpad for volume

117
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:54,605
(Google home sound)

118
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:00,505
