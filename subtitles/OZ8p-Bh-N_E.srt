Friends, May be you all are enjoying free data

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,740
but in today's date, you may have fgvhv

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,460
 

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,260
if you see, free of charge is no more free

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,960
and 
in such a case that if you are in a rural area

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,960
and if you don't have sufficient internet speed

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,160
then probably you might not be able to see this video properly

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,060
for that YouTube has developed a new superb app for India which is called as

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,720
YouTube Go

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,900
and today I am going to talk with you about that

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,780
because here we say

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,400
Maje Udao, Data Nhi

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,120
Hello Friends, 
My name is Gaurav

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,080
and you are watching
Technical Guruji

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,380
So Let's Begin

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,140
Friend's I had already made another video on YouTube Go somedays before

20
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,780
but that time it was only announced

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,660
But now it is available in play store in the BETA format

22
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,460
and more updates are comming soon

23
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,240
so lets see how much awesome youtube go is

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,860
and whether it will let you download videos on slow net speed

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,560
and though this you can share the videos too

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,460
now let see youtube go

27
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,300
this is youtube go application on play store

28
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,820
download are still little because it is released recently

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,520
and if you read it benefits and details by going into its Readmore option

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,800
and here you will it is a normal application

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,900
which works like youtube

32
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,140
but here you will have many data benefits and the size of the app is low

33
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,680
instead of that you can control data, share videos after downloading

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,320
and this app is going to be fast and will work on old phones too

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,300
so here are many benefits of youtube go

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,480
and if you need I will give the link to this app in the description

37
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,260
so from there you can install this app

38
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:50,020
after installing this, you will be asked to verify your mobile no. which is linked to your google account

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,620
doing all this and you will get the app home screen

40
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:02,820
here you will get videos depending on your search history or standard trending videos

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,680
and here you will get another tab for saved videos

42
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,120
where you can see your saved video collection

43
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,580
and if you want you can send or receive them too 
which is the most important feature of this app

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,460
and you also get some basic setting where you can change your language kinds of stuff

45
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,720
you will get this basic layout where you can search videos

46
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,180
and if you click them you will see the preview of the where you can see

47
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,540
what content is inside that video because this happens often mostly

48
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,680
where video content other than video title and your data get wasted

49
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,120
so here you will not let your data get wasted and

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,420
you also get some options for video quality

51
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,680
a basic quality which will be around 144p 
and

52
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,680
and a standard one having like 360p

53
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,140
you will also see the size of video according to the quality for letting you play or save

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,160
for a sample, I will save this video on basic quality

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,340
I clicked on save

56
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,440
here the video is saving

57
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,000
and after completion it came in my saved videos

58
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,420
now let I want to share this with my friends

59
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,800
you can do it too if you and your friends use YouTube go app

60
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:17,820
although you may not get the option for subscription, like/dislike you can't comment in this app

61
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,680
but even at least you can see the youtube in less data

62
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,320
so if I want to send

63
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,840
which video I want to send 
I will click on this video to send

64
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,380
then it will try to make a local wifi hotspot 
clicked on allow once

65
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,840
It will make wifi and scan nearby

66
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,260
and now at that time I have to pick the other phone where you want to get video

67
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,100
and click on receive video

68
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,660
after that, they will make the connection and will show the name,

69
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,400
when clicked it will show confirmation message on the phone wether you want to send it or not

70
00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:01,900
afterward the video will be transferred between the phones in less instance of time

71
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,280
and after receiving video, you can see the same video

72
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,620
it is an excellent option by the way

73
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,140
but as I said you will not get any other option on the video you can only watch it

74
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,260
you can neither like nor comment on the video

75
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,880
but you can search and play many videos like if you want to see Technical Guruji

76
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,960
when you will search that you will find many videos which you can see

77
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,020
that is a good point

78
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,780
beacuse you want to save data

79
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,200
because you know the free is no more freer

80
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,420
so in case you can use, this YouTube Go app which will save your precious data

81
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,060
I am giving the link in the description 
Go install it

82
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,680
and Save your data because, we want fun without using data

83
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,560
