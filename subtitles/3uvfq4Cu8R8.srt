1
00:00:00,707 --> 00:00:01,728
Where is the gold?

2
00:00:01,818 --> 00:00:02,799
Where is the gold?

3
00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:03,489
Gold?

4
00:00:03,579 --> 00:00:04,210
Gold?

5
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,117
Gold?

6
00:00:07,194 --> 00:00:09,356
We would like to welcome everyone onboard.

7
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:10,737
Hello, I am Vijay Walia.

8
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:12,346
Chairman, Kohinoor Airlines.

9
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:15,493
When are we getting our salaries?

10
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,544
Next week with the Diwali bonus we'll
get all our pending dues.

11
00:00:18,634 --> 00:00:20,994
We won't even get a box of sweets on Diwali,

12
00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:22,886
and you're dreaming of a bonus.

13
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:27,233
Jasmine. You haven't
paid the rent for six months.

14
00:00:28,744 --> 00:00:31,062
We slogged like maids for 20 years.

15
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,271
We let them deduct pay for taxes.
Then for provident fund.

16
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:34,780
And we let them screw us over.

17
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:38,955
Is our company bankrupt?

18
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:40,690
Madam, what are you saying?

19
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:43,303
Swear on Mother Goddess, Mr. Bindra.

20
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:43,994
We're bankrupt.

21
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:45,551
Swear on God we're bankrupt.

22
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:48,354
Rajvanshi sir.

23
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:52,364
Show some humanity, Jasmine.

24
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:53,618
A poor guy is...

25
00:00:53,835 --> 00:00:55,575
Scoundrel.

26
00:00:57,138 --> 00:00:57,735
Shall we keep it?

27
00:00:57,825 --> 00:00:58,815
Are you out of your mind?

28
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:00,063
If we get caught,

29
00:01:00,153 --> 00:01:01,487
they will ban us from the airport,
let alone an airplane.

30
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:06,316
You turned out to be such a sly guy,
Mr. Mittal.

31
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:07,831
We don't have money to buy biscuits,

32
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:09,843
and you guys are rolling in gold.

33
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:11,344
Help us too, sir.

34
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:13,212
Will you be able to do it?

35
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:16,141
We're going to live
it up today like the rich.

36
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,437
Where are you going?

37
00:01:18,527 --> 00:01:19,319
To do an exotic dance?

38
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,026
Want to see.

39
00:01:20,116 --> 00:01:20,809
Comedy?

40
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:23,929
There is someone knows about us.

41
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:26,078
-What are you doing here?
-Customs.

42
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:26,990
Customs?

43
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:28,184
What's in the bag?

44
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,177
Shit.

45
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:36,926
If you are going,
make sure he gets a good view.

46
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,394
Sethi ma'am.

47
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:43,931
Money can turn anyone into a gangster.

48
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:47,542
How can he just get away?

49
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:48,705
Because he's rich, baby.

50
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:50,692
Oh, shit.

51
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:51,950
Look at Titanic.

52
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,734
The rich escaped in boats.

53
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:55,000
Who had to drown?

54
00:01:58,364 --> 00:01:59,781
The department has
received some sort of tip.

55
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:00,683
You are going nowhere, madam.

56
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:01,918
I am scared.

57
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:03,127
Then sing.

58
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:04,154
Which one?

59
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:06,501
"Gold. So much Gold."

60
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:07,324
Seriously?

61
00:02:12,117 --> 00:02:13,174
Geetu.

62
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:15,070
You're a capable pilot,
you're good at everything.

63
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,150
But I can't do it.

64
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:18,379
Fly the plane.

65
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:20,768
Papa!

66
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:22,599
Is the tip confirmed?

67
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:23,385
Solid.

68
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:24,808
Does the jail have internet?

69
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,598
Sir, please be seated.

70
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,949
They were saying they
were preparing for some arrest.

71
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:37,491
Arrest?

72
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,330
You. Sit, moron.
