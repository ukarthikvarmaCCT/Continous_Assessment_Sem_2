00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,720
Hi Guys, Whats up? Thanks a lot for watching Booxoul...

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,740
Today, we are going to talk about...

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Teri Bhais ki pooch (Your Buffalo's tail)

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,840
Ant sant mat Bol (Don't talk Rubbish)

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,120
types of words...

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,380
In English, we call these informal phrases, 'SLANGS'

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,380
In our country, that's India...

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,400
almost everyone wants to speak English as fluent as they can...

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,140
but what happens is...

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,940
while speaking we run out words!

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,260
I can't increase your vocabulary in this short video

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,140
even if it was a bit lengthier I couldn't, because ...

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,880
umm... my vocabulary sucks!

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,960
So, like 'Teri Bhaiss ki pooch' doesn't mean 'Buffalo's tail' in English

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,060
Similarly, there are some words, some slangs

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,900
which means a bit different than what they seem

17
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:40,780
So, let's see them!!!

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,400
The first slang is 'SICK'

19
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,820
We all know, what SICK means in general

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,880
when someone is ill or something like that...

21
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,840
but in English as a Slang, it means a bit different

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,480
In English, as a slang it means that something is very amazing or excellent

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,000
for example...

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,520
She looks sick in that Dress.

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,200
and I overacted

26
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,840
We just went to Nikhil's Party last night. I mean it was SICK! I wanna go back again.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,260
and I overacted again!!!

28
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,300
The 2nd slang is 'binge-watch'

29
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,980
Don't we all sometimes watch the whole season at once?

30
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,780
Watching one episode after other and again and again...

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,480
That is what known as 'binge-watch'

32
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,760
For example...

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,620
I just binge-watched 13 reasons why and I love that show now!

34
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,920
The 3rd slang is Butt-Dial

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,420
Sometimes #accidentally we call someone on our phone while it's inside our pocket or while sitting

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,460
So, that call that's an accident is known as butt-dial.

37
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,660
For example...

38
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,420
Hey, I think you butt-dialed me yesterday.

39
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,860
You called me and then it was just noise.

40
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,460
The 4th slang is 'BAIL'

41
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,260
We all have heard of this word 'BAIL', at least in Bollywood movies

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,520
Someone's inside jail? Let's bail him out...

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,700
But in English, it's a bit different

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,140
In English, it means 'Leaving suddenly/Abrubtly'

45
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,860
Suppose, you go with your friends to watch cinema and then you realized

46
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,160
Oh F**K! I forget to do the homework!!!

47
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,720
So, you'll say

48
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,800
Hey guys, I'm sorry. I'm gonna bail!

49
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,880
The 5th slang is Feeling Blue

50
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,080
It simply means 'to feel sad'

51
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,160
If I'm saying that I'm feeling blue that means I'm feeling sad

52
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,560
The 6th slang is 'by the skin of my teeth'

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,900
In Hindi, we can phrase it as 'Baal Baal Bache'

54
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,000
For example...

55
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,760
I managed to pass my exam by the skin of my teeth.

56
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,780
The 7th slang is couch-potato

57
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,060
Couch-potato is a person who sits on the sofa all day and does nothing!

58
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,260
Like a friend of mine...

59
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,240
So, that's all guys!!!
