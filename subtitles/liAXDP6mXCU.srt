1
00:00:00,045 --> 00:00:01,934
It's 12 o'clock, we've reached home.

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:06,317
Finally met Pihu. She came
running and hugged dad.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,330
Right bro? Where did you go for a walk?

4
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:09,162
Where's Didi?

5
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:11,626
Dad! Pihu!

6
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,056
Didi went to sleep.

7
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:14,046
Didi went to sleep?

8
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:14,826
She's asleep.

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,193
It's 3 o'clock in the morning

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,088
I just realized that I had a
cricket match on Sunday.

11
00:00:19,213 --> 00:00:21,155
In 6 o'clock in the morning. I
have to cancel the cricket now.

12
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:23,540
I'm not feeling well. I
have fever, cold.

13
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:25,590
And she said that I'll put desi ghee in my nose.

14
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:27,171
Really, One more time.

15
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:29,038
I'll not put desi ghee in my nose.

16
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,249
- I'm telling you the truth just one time 
- No No

17
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:33,164
I have a bad problem at home.

18
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:35,820
- Give me where it is, It's broken?
- Where

19
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:37,275
My fever is not going.

20
00:00:37,275 --> 00:00:38,914
I thought I'll measure my
fever with a thermometer.

21
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:39,856
But the thermometer broke.

22
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,284
It's 3 o'clock in the morning. I've
taken 2 tablets, fever is not going away.

23
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,275
I was measuring my fever.

24
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:46,090
I'll go in the morning.

25
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:48,974
As soon as I put it
in my mouth, it fell off.

26
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:50,116
Here it is.

27
00:00:50,454 --> 00:00:51,725
Ritu, here's the mercury.

28
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:52,681
Here..

29
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:53,789
Don't pick it up with your hand.

30
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:55,647
- Ohhh
- Bring me a broom

31
00:00:55,952 --> 00:00:57,978
Yes, it will hold here like this.

32
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,608
Fun and interesting fact.

33
00:00:59,695 --> 00:01:01,728
It's not allowed to take the
thermometer on the aircraft.

34
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:04,173
Because the aircraft is
mostly made of carbon fiber.

35
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,716
But it's mostly made of aluminum.

36
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:08,292
So, Mercury is 13.6 relative density.

37
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:11,041
If it breaks, it will make
a hole in the aluminum.

38
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:13,686
When I get sick, and

39
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:17,717
I wake up late at
night, I do this cheating.

40
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:20,485
What's up, guys? Welcome back to the vlog.

41
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:22,766
I had a bad cold in the morning.

42
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,394
I had a bad headache.

43
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:26,766
I woke up at 5.30 or 5.00 a.m.

44
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:28,825
I was having a teribble
headache, my nerves was like this.

45
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:31,879
I woke up in the morning
and Ritu put this on my head.

46
00:01:32,044 --> 00:01:33,073
I didn't feel good.

47
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:34,588
I asked Ritu to give me a disprin.

48
00:01:34,814 --> 00:01:35,877
Ritu gave me a disprin.

49
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,013
I took the disprin with hot water.

50
00:01:38,134 --> 00:01:40,413
As soon as I took the
dispenser, I had vomiting.

51
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:42,853
I feel much better now.

52
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:43,737
Feeling much betetr.

53
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:44,515
Come on, Pihu.

54
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:45,450
Rashi went to school.

55
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:49,001
Rashi took out his lunch box in the
morning because she has a holiday today.

56
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,954
Both the kids are eating lunch boxes.

57
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:51,646
Eat, son.

58
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:52,320
Eat it.

59
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:53,923
You also come, eat.

60
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:55,830
Don't give cash to Mau.

61
00:01:56,412 --> 00:01:57,112
Hello, plane.

62
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,972
The plane goes just right above our house.

63
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:04,728
What happened?

64
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:07,058
There is a fly, remove the fly.

65
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:09,069
It's bothering my son.

66
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:11,085
What did you do in my absence, Mau?

67
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:13,634
What happened to Rashi today?

68
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:15,072
Balle Balle, shawa shawa.

69
00:02:15,128 --> 00:02:17,375
Because today is school holiday.

70
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:19,457
Did Pihu give you a hug in the morning?

71
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:19,798
Yes

72
00:02:19,822 --> 00:02:20,510
Where is my hug?

73
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:22,133
She did not hug first, then gave again.

74
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,695
Where is your sister's hug?

75
00:02:29,893 --> 00:02:30,970
Did you give a hug to your dad?

76
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:32,609
Hello, you have grown up.

77
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:35,716
Show me your nails,
how did they get so big.

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh God.

79
00:02:55,623 --> 00:02:56,456
Today is Sunday.

80
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:58,292
I thought I would take a day off.

81
00:02:58,693 --> 00:02:59,661
I am going to the doctor.

82
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:00,602
Put the umbrella back son.

83
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,604
Have taken the cat and
also took the umbrella.

84
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:04,230
We are going to the doctor or what?

85
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:12,179
- Who is she? Cat
- Cat

86
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,126
Meow

87
00:03:13,177 --> 00:03:15,844
Ritu and I was discussing about Rashi.

88
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:19,293
Rashi, If mom and dad can talk in English have
you understand, we were talking about you.

89
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:19,950
Yes.

90
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:21,869
Yes, you know what
we just talked about.

91
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:23,968
You talked about my play.

92
00:03:24,058 --> 00:03:25,198
About your play?

93
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:26,136
Yes, exactly.

94
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:29,309
We were discussing
about Rashi's play style.

95
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,962
How did she behave before and now?

96
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,221
She can understand.

97
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:37,321
Child's behavior depends on
with whom she's plays,

98
00:03:37,414 --> 00:03:40,469
walks or sits in school.

99
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:44,362
Now, Rashi's behavior has changed.

100
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:46,074
Ritu, let's drink coffee?

101
00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:47,997
There is a good coffee shop here.

102
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:48,958
Is this a good market?

103
00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:50,123
Which sector is this?

104
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,605
I am on the market for the first time
since we moved into the new house.

105
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,011
Otherwise, everything is on home delivery.

106
00:04:01,297 --> 00:04:02,610
We didn't get the doctor before

107
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:05,038
Now I have got so many that I
am confused as to whom to go.

108
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:06,301
Everyone is good here.

109
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:07,805
Here is also good.

110
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:08,655
Everyone is good.

111
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:10,102
We are asking whom to go.

112
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:11,657
Which doctor is here now?

113
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,139
Where did he go, this is where he sit.

114
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,630
We are in a new place.

115
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,003
Here are all the doctors.

116
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,185
All are doctors, doctors..

117
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:21,116
Today is sunday.

118
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:23,512
Today is sunday all
doctors clinic is closed.

119
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:25,568
Now what will a man do
if he gets sick on Sunday?

120
00:04:25,602 --> 00:04:28,186
We are buying medicines
from homeopathic store.

121
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:29,257
Anyway we didn't get it.

122
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:32,166
Tomorrow morning I
have to go on a trip again.

123
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,889
I know I have lot of
travel involved in my life.

124
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:35,979
That's why I asked for medicine,
but it's not available right now.

125
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:38,490
Now we have come to the stationery shop,
I have bought some stationery for myself.

126
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,798
But how much in childhood.

127
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:42,092
You will not have to keep it,
I am not buying anything for you.

128
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:45,031
See, it feels so good
after seeing them.

129
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:45,434
Pen?

130
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:48,471
When I was young, I was used
to like, Mom take this pencil.

131
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,348
It used to cost 5 rupees.

132
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:50,469
How much is it now?

133
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:52,197
80 rupees.

134
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:55,584
People are enjoying
Chole Bhature on Sunday.

135
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,954
The fever does not go away from the
Dolo, now we will take the good one.

136
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:01,789
We have been roaming here for an hour.

137
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:03,648
We can't find our car.

138
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:05,848
I won. I won.

139
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:07,148
Let's go. Let's go.

140
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:07,877
No, No

141
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:09,969
Pihu, who won? Dad won or sister won?

142
00:05:10,013 --> 00:05:11,256
Say Dad won.

143
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,253
Noo

144
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:15,148
Pihu is not here.

145
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,750
Pihu doesn't here.

146
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:24,085
Pihu

147
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:33,564
What's up guys?

148
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:35,826
Today we have to go out for a shoot.

149
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:37,541
And we have to do beautification.

150
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,132
Today let's try Mama
Earth's charcoal face pack.

151
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:44,158
This has active charcoal.

152
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,632
But there is a confusion.

153
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:51,637
Should I apply it on my beard or not?

154
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:54,026
And how much should I
apply is also a confusion.

155
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:00,412
Cleanse your face with Mama
Earth charcoal face wash.

156
00:06:00,437 --> 00:06:01,670
Dab your face dry.

157
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,784
Apply a generous layer.

158
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:04,762
Face should be dry, let's on the AC.

159
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:06,126
Keep it for 15 minutes.

160
00:06:06,257 --> 00:06:07,882
Oh Bro, it's been 18 minutes.

161
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:09,746
We only had to apply it for 15 minutes.

162
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:10,535
Where is Pihu?

163
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,601
Hold the camera.

164
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:14,270
Don't show Pihu.

165
00:06:19,284 --> 00:06:20,318
She got it.

166
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:22,594
She got it.

167
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:24,754
I was a little scared in the beginning.

168
00:06:24,912 --> 00:06:26,210
Then she understood.

169
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:32,962
Recently I used this product.

170
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,293
I liked it a lot.

171
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:35,157
It's very helpful.

172
00:06:35,182 --> 00:06:36,910
It feels very fresh.

173
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:40,093
It cleanses all the pores
with activated charchol.

174
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:41,094
And one tip.

175
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:42,901
Wash it with warm water.

176
00:06:42,926 --> 00:06:45,012
It will stick to your face with cold water.

177
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:47,852
You may have heard a lot
about  activated charcoal.

178
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:48,858
It's good for the skin.

179
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:49,777
But what is this?

180
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:53,233
It increases the surface area of carbon
