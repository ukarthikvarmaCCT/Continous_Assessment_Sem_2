00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:14,320
Friends, today we have brought for you an
exclusive unboxing of iQOO Neo 9

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,000
which can be called
iQOO Neo 9 Pro in India

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,320
which will have Snapdragon 8 Gen 2

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,240
In China, there were two variants,
Neo 9 and Neo 9 Pro

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,700
The Pro variant of China
had Dimensity 9300

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,680
But the Neo 9 of China
is Snapdragon 8 Gen 2

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,830
So the Neo 9 Pro in India will be
with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,620
Big confusion

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,190
Now friends, the interesting thing is that you get
Android 14 Origin OS with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,890
and we hope that iQOO
brings Origin OS in India

11
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,900
because we have tested it
and matched it with Funtouch OS

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,390
and what difference we have seen,
you will see everything in this video

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,150
Now the box is like this, the box of the Indian variant can be completely different

14
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,970
In the box, you get a bag case, 120W
adapter, Type C cable, everything

15
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,360
Now we will keep this box at the back

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,910
Now let's talk about the
design and build of the phone

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,400
So here you get 8.34mm
thickness and 190 grams

18
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,480
So the weight and thickness
of this phone is quite acceptable

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,160
and in boxy style, you will
get to see it in a square shape

20
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,390
You get to see rounded edges here

21
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,810
and at the back, you get this dual
texture design and leather bag

22
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,770
You will get the feel of leather here

23
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,880
and I got to know that the
other colors don't have leather

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,650
Rest, the design is completely
different and the phone looks great

25
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,920
It feels good that iQOO gives some different combinations when it comes to leather

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,160
Rest, you get to see the frames in plastic

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,370
Below, you can put dual nano sims

28
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,370
You get a mic hole, Type
C port, one speaker below

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,890
and one speaker above at earpiece

30
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,960
So dual stereo speakers
are provided here

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,920
Rest, you get a mic hole
and IR blaster above

32
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,930
On the right, you get a power button,
volume up and down key

33
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,140
and under display
fingerprint scanner

34
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,570
Now the unlock system of
the origin OS was very fast

35
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,760
As soon as we unlock it,
it opens up quickly

36
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,690
and the animation
was also very different

37
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,640
When we compared it
with the funtouch OS

38
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,350
So we saw a lot of difference in its
animation and its animation

39
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,360
and this unlock was very fast

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,580
Its haptics are very different,
it has an X-axis linear motor

41
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,900
Multitasking is very
good at different places

42
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,660
The fun was very different there

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,170
I forgot to say one thing,
you also get IP54 ratings

44
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,700
For performance,
it has Snapdragon 8 Gen 2

45
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,030
and I liked this thing that iQOO decided to put two variants
in China, one with MediaTek and othere is with Snapdragon

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,790
but they have decided to put only
Snapdragon variant in India

47
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,440
They know that the audience of
Snapdragon is more

48
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,020
They did the same in
iQOO Neo 7 Pro

49
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,700
They gave Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1

50
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,550
iQOO Neo 9 Pro is coming
with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2

51
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,370
I liked this thing very much

52
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,750
This is officially confirmed

53
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,470
The performance is top notch

54
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,480
This is the flagship chipset of 2023

55
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,300
Now it has come to the
upper mid-range category

56
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,690
The Antutu scores were amazing,
around 1.6 million

57
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,050
The CPU throttling was very good,
79%, being a Chinese variant

58
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,280
Still it was seated at 44 degrees Celsius

59
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,330
But I am sure that when it comes to India

60
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,370
so we will not see such high
thermals in the Indian variant

61
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,230
LPDDR5X, UFS4 is also a big upgrade

62
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,860
and the app open-close, multitasking

63
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,490
It is smooth as it has Origin OS

64
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:18,970
We noticed that we have
iQOO 12 with Funtouch OS 14

65
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,800
It has Funtouch
OS 14 and Android 14

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,850
Both have Android 14

67
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,040
Let me show you the difference between Origin OS and Funtouch OS 14

68
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,220
All the apps are closed here

69
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,070
We have only Call of Duty here

70
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,100
If I give you a comparison of both the
animations and speed

71
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,700
It is very close

72
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,420
don't forget that we have
Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in iQOO 12

73
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,570
even after that, it is almost close

74
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,390
In fact, if I open the gallery
app, it is very close

75
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,440
But we noticed one thing

76
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,810
If I close all the apps in it

77
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,910
And when I bring Funtouch OS 13

78
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,350
There is a difference

79
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,730
If I open this, now we will see

80
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,230
Now we will know how fast Origin OS is

81
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,730
You will see the loading
speed in front of you

82
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,070
So I have seen the difference
here in Origin OS

83
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,710
There are many other things that
we will talk about software in this

84
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,340
But overall experience is amazing

85
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,060
You can play gaming on high graphics

86
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,220
And there is 4D Vibration,
so when I was playing the game

87
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,430
the haptics that I was getting here

88
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,320
It was amazing

89
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,950
They have done this very well

90
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,340
And they have given
dedicated Q1 chip

91
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,100
Which works in both
performance and display

92
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,110
Let's talk about the display

93
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,170
You get 6.7 inch with 1.5k resolution

94
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,720
In an LTPO AMOLED display

95
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,850
It gives you a 144 Hz high refresh rate

96
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,520
In fact, its smoothness was better

97
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,350
Because this is Origin OS

98
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,560
You can't judge this because
it is Chinese varient

99
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,300
Who knows they might
bring Origin OS in India

100
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,140
And optimize it separately

101
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,950
But I am not sure that it
will come with Origin OS

102
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,080
But it is good if it comes

103
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,190
But its smoothness when we compared
it with Funtouch OS 13

104
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,500
It was very fast

105
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,270
You get 3000 nits peak brightness

106
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,930
Outdoor visibility was very good

107
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,170
View angles were also very good

108
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,390
Its panel is used very well

109
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,180
punch hole is in centre,
you get very less chin

110
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,480
And it is a flat display,
not a curved display

111
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,140
And as I told you,
Q1 in display is also given

112
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,730
which is the extra chip

113
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,400
Frame rate interpolation,
you got that everything here

114
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,600
Overall, display panel
is used very well

115
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,760
For software, it has Android 14

116
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,320
And it is based on Origin OS

117
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,300
Which is for China

118
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,670
I recommend it for India as well

119
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,650
I have told you in two things

120
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,420
that how fast it is in
multitasking and swipes

121
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,050
Apart from that, its dialer is different

122
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,860
If we compare it with Funtouch OS

123
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,020
Notification panel is
completely different

124
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,520
When we matched it

125
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,840
Smoothness overall has improved

126
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,230
Animation has also improved

127
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,830
If you look at the
notification panel carefully

128
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,340
You get to see it transparent

129
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,160
App opens speed is fast

130
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,690
Game loading speed is fast

131
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,140
Text has been highlighted

132
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,720
Animation pattern lock is also different

133
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
In fact, when you unlock the phone

134
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,860
It is also different

135
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,700
Here I am noticing that there is a lot of difference

136
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,790
Between Funtouch and Origin

137
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,090
This is my experience

138
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,770
We recommend to iQOO,
that they should bring it

139
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,630
And you also go and tell iQOO

140
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,730
That bring Origin OS

141
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,530
It will be fun

142
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,540
Camera is impressive

143
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,500
You have 50MP primary sensor

144
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,250
IMX 920 is given

145
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:12,970
It is very good

146
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,100
It comes with OIS

147
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,230
and max you can shoot
8k video at 30fps

148
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,940
It also has an ultra wide sensor

149
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,960
But they have done a good job

150
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,340
that no 2MP game is played,
apart from that

151
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,680
Slow motion is at FHD 240 fps

152
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,280
You can shoot
good slow motion videos

153
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,210
Night mode features

154
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,750
Portrait features, everything is here

155
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,210
and 20x zoom in photo given

156
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,810
10x zoom in video

157
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,260
as for selfie, you get 16MP selfie

158
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,450
FHD 30fps, I don't like it

159
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,770
they still stuck at FHD

160
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,770
4K should be in selfie

161
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,430
well it is Chinese
variant so can't be judged

162
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,610
still i am showing you some photos

163
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,990
it is good photo, portrait is good

164
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,690
Dynamic range is good, rear and selfie
both are good there is no problem

165
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,080
video Stabilization is good

166
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,700
You can see in rear selfie

167
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,520
I have left the link on google drive

168
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,660
Indian variant has different optimization

169
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,320
then we can judge in detail

170
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,340
Battery is 5160 mAh

171
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,640
Capacity is a bit high

172
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,990
They have maintained the phone well

173
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,300
It is slim

174
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,960
120W adapter is given in the box

175
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,360
You can charge it in 25 minutes

176
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,870
We tested battery drain

177
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,410
We left 8K video recording for 1.5 hours
at 100% at the morning 8 am

178
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,240
when we checked it
at 10 am, it was 72%

179
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:25,980
It is quite impressive

180
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,770
because 8K video takes a lot of resources

181
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,880
Even hotspot takes a lot of resources

182
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,840
You should test more in these 2 things

183
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,690
Overall battery results were good

184
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,380
But I won't come to conclusion,
because it is Chinese varient

185
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,050
You will get 5G connectivity

186
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,870
in India, you will get multiple 5G bands

187
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,190
But you get WiFi 7

188
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,390
It is quite impressive

189
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,070
Bluetooth version 5.3
and NFC is also given

190
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,980
It will definitely retain in India

191
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,490
You get support of all sensors

192
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,690
Let's talk about prices

193
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,310
It is quite aggressive

194
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,550
You won't believe

195
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,910
It is launched in China under 30K

196
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,160
It starts around 26K

197
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,360
and with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage

198
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,970
It has Snapdragon 8Gen2

199
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,320
It has many other features also

200
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,260
It has higher variants like
16-256, 16-512, 16-1TB

201
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,140
But pricing is quite aggressive

202
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:18,330
I can guess that maybe it
will be around 35K in India

203
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,620
I have expectations from iQOO

204
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,370
Because they have aggressive pricing

205
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,080
I think iQOO Neo 9 Pro will
come around that price

206
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,620
I am just speculating

207
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,030
I don't have any confirmation

208
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,870
You comment below and tell us
what its price should be.

209
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,870
Overall phone is good

210
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:33,429
It is Chinese variant

211
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,020
but i am waiting for Indian variant

212
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,280
You should also wait for our Indian
variant varient unboxing

213
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,890
Because there is a big difference,
between Chinese and Indian varient

214
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,559
