if you freeze it at the right time it

101
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,099
looks like the car is going for takeoff

102
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,900
and then it looks sad when it hits the

103
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,120
ground because it's like oh maybe next

104
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,400
time car falls down the lift that means

105
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,940

139
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,320
the idea that he was just listening to a

147
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,320
satisfying yeah it really is it's just

148
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,120
peeling it back when does the train come

149
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,680
to a hole when it stops I didn't think

150
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,180
of that apparently a plane got stuck

151
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,740
under a bridge let's see how that's a

152
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,460
big plane that is that's a small Bridge

153
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,199
do they call that a plane crash yeah

154
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,539
does that qualify as a plane crash I

155
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:25,800
don't want to fly on that plane truck

156
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,720
crashes into highway signs you're gonna

157
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,180
want to watch out watch it oh

158
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,560
how's our truck being destroyed more

159
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,419
damage than a plane well it was only

160
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,460
like a scrape to the top of it you know

161
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,680
those signs on the highway are like a

162
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,120
hundred thousand dollars each government

163
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,220
is inefficient camera equipment gets

164
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,199

167
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,120
camera hard to be a gimbal when you're

168
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,919
rolling on the ground Dingus I wonder

169
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,240
what those shots look like they don't

170
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,979
look like much because the second it

171
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,500
hits the ground the lens starts yeah

172
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,759
usually that makes the shot look

173
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,979
terrible a truck driver spilled a bunch

174
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,539
of yellow paint well now people are

175
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:07,800
going to be really confused if they're

when you guys drop mustard on me yes

179
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,160

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,900
indoors this is whistling diesel I hate

181
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,699
being that guy he deserves to get that

182
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,199
thing to crash that looks safe

183
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,900
you know Jimmy I picked the wrong crazy

184

person on YouTube to hang out with you

185
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,100

you here whistling diesel whistle my way

189
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,500
this looks like us in 2018 if we had

190
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,300
today's budget yeah that's literally

191
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,759
what he is fishing boat Falls over oh no

192
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,380
don't they understand boats are supposed

193
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,360
to go in water yeah that's probably the

194
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,660
problem

195
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:52,979
POV the other side of the boat

196
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,060
officially

197
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,400

202
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,060
is a better boat than that fishing boat

203
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,220
we're going on a ride I believe that any

204
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,660
house near water is going to be very

205
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,400
expensive if anything this is an upgrade

206
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,080
yeah if you're on the second floor you

207
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,580

employee there who's going to stop you

216
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,660
from just running over there and just

217
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,099
it's going to waste anyway because

218
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:36,360
you're getting fired you're getting

219
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,759

220
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,220
how can you think that you could be on

221
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,380
this list if you don't drive a Bugatti

222
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,680

223
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,240
he was paying two million dollars for an

224
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,740
amphibious car these fish are looking

that's a massive question oh no he's

229
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,180
going the wrong way entirely you have to

230
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,380
imagine when your car is facing the

231
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,120
exact opposite direction in a race

232
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,680
what's going through your head oh my God

233
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,319
I hope I face the other way please train

234
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,419
Falls and drops Bridge wait when do they

235
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,160
make cranes that big cranes can get

236
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,220
humongous but that bridge must be giant

237
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,620
oh yeah it is oh my God look at everyone

238
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,900
running it's like in slo-mo it's like

239
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,360
when giant Fallen like video games and

240
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,680
you're like something big wouldn't fall

241
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,599
in slow-mo like that it does apparently

242
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,340
honestly I didn't know how Jets land but

243
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,479
I didn't expect it to look like that

244
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,520
this is a special type of Jet and it

245
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,800
costs a lot of money to get it that was

246
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,360
basically 500 million dollars down the

247
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,880
drain oh he just gosh thank you that

248
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,860
took him a second oh he's like at least

249
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,080
I got to use the ejector seat oh that

250
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,000
hurt he was not high enough to use the

251
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,860
ejector seat why did he eject the jet

252
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,540
was right there that was a person that

253
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,880
was Panic panicking that's a very

254
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
expensive jet there's only a couple of

255
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,300
those and he just broke it and he was

256
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,980
like I just gotta get out of this wait

257
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,839

258
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,459
awesome a little less even less

259
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,560
oh I did not think all that would happen

260
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,420
well that would explain the 20 million

261
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,060
was that like a natural disaster yeah

262
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,800
