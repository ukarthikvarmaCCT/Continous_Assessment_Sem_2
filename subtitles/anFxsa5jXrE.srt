1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,880
- We dumpster dove 100 dumpsters.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,530
It's Chris versus Weddle.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,640
They will take turns to see

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,350
who can find the most valuable stuff.

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,340
See this guy?

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,900
He's a professional appraiser.

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,730
He's gonna tell us what
everything's worth.

8
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,020
And whoever makes the most money,

9
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,180
wins $10,000 at the end.

10
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,080
Who wants the first one?

11
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,913
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

12
00:00:16,913 --> 00:00:17,970
- I'll take one for the team.

13
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,930
- Here's your ladder.

14
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,430
You don't have to do
this if you don't wanna.

15
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,360
- No, I need the money.

16
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,193
- [Jimmy] Okay.

17
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,713
- Lamp!

18
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:25,546
- [Jimmy] Oh, wow.

19
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:26,970
- Dude, if our appraiser's a moth,

20
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,340
this is gonna be like
worth thousands of dollars.

21
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,390
- This hampers not bad.

22
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,283
- Oh wait, grab that jar of stuff.

23
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,680
- [Jimmy] Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

24
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,064
- It's smelly.

25
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:36,897
(Weddle gags)

26
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:37,811
Oh, that's smelly.

27
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:39,450
What if I just

28
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,410
do this right here.

29
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,754
Enjoy your trash, man.

30
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:42,587
- That was mean!

31
00:00:42,587 --> 00:00:44,130
- [Chris] No, it was an accident.

32
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,720
- I feel this trash can's done.

33
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,553
- What would you pay for it,

34
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:48,217
if someone brought this
into your pawn shop?

35
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:49,050
- $2.

36
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,270
- What is this basket valued at?

37
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,466
- Five bucks, it's in-
- [Jimmy And Weddle] Wow!

38
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:53,299
- pretty good condition.
- What?!

39
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:55,620
- Mr. Chris, this dumpster's yours.

40
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,453
Cannonball.

41
00:00:56,453 --> 00:00:57,750
Oh gosh.
- Oh god!

42
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,190
- Oh gosh, dude he found-

43
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,033
- [Weddle] What is that?!

44
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:01,500
- That is luggage

45
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,790
filled with cat poop.

46
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,286
- And it's got folded scrubs

47
00:01:04,286 --> 00:01:05,629
and underwear.

48
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:07,140
Oh, a straightener!

49
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,973
That's nice.

50
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:09,512
- Don't, don't.

51
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:10,821
No!

52
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,080
- Oh, dude, these are nice slippers!

53
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,315
These are L.L.Bean slippers.

54
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:15,210
- What?!

55
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,043
I shouldn't have let him go first.

56
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:16,980
- Whoa, look at this!

57
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,510
- Still in the case.
- A phone case!

58
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,190
- This iPhone case is still in the box.

59
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,023
What's it worth?

60
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:22,650
- Best I can do is $4.

61
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,700
- This thing?

62
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,533
- 10 cent.

63
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:25,740
$10 for those.

64
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,000
Assuming it's working,

65
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,900
I'd give you two bucks.

66
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,170
- What's this luxury suitcase,
with cat poop, worth?

67
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,550
- I'd give you five for that.

68
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,383
- Whoa.

69
00:01:33,383 --> 00:01:34,350
After one dumpster each,

70
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,940
Chris has made $21.

71
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,050
Weddle has made seven.

72
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,280
All right, Mr. Weddle.

73
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,755
Here's your second dumpster.

74
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:40,588
- Oh, that's not too bad.

75
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:41,942
Nope, oy!

76
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:42,775
Oh!

77
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:43,608
Calculator!

78
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:44,970
Oh!

79
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,803
Yes.

80
00:01:45,803 --> 00:01:46,636
(Weddle yells)

81
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:48,510
- You found a head
scratcher and a calculator.

82
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,565
- It works.
- Whoa!

83
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:51,401
I can give you 20 bucks for this.

84
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:52,402
- Woo!

85
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:53,307
- What is this, 1990?

86
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:54,600
You got one on your phone.

87
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,980
- [Jimmy] What is this
head scratcher worth?

88
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,813
- Two bucks.

89
00:01:56,813 --> 00:01:59,670
- That brings your total to $29.

90
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,503
- I'll take it.

91
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:01,620
- Chris, you are currently losing now.

92
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,427
- But how much am I losing by?

93
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:04,260
- $8.

94
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,730
- And how many dumpsters has Weddle done?

95
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,563
- [Weddle] Two.

96
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:07,396
- And how many have I done?

97
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:09,390
- Hey, let me check the
math with my calculator.

98
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,250
- Hey, the nineties called.

99
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,600
That sucks.

100
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,433
- All right, Chris.

101
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,490
Dumpster number four.

102
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,480
- Before I got in the dumpster,

103
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,313
I found this ring.

104
00:02:16,313 --> 00:02:17,146
- That counts.

105
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,620
- LED light rings.

106
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,453
- [Jimmy] A bagel.

107
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:21,480
- It's still in the wrapper.

108
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,100
- I don't think you can
take this to a pawn shop.

109
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,224
- I don't know what this is.

110
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:25,057
(sword unsheathes)

111
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,250
- [Jimmy] Oh my god!

112
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,170
- I found a sword!

113
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,310
Is this a murder weapon?!

114
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,501
Dude, I literally thought
that was just trash.

115
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,334
What?!

116
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:35,400
(man speaks in foreign language)

117
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,050
- What would you say this ring is worth?

118
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:37,883
- 50 cent.

119
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:38,970
- What'd you say this sword is worth?

120
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,050
- 25 bucks for this.

121
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,760
- What do you think those
four ring lights are worth?

122
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,997
- Two of them look burnt out.

123
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,490
$2 for the other two.

124
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,390
So $4.

125
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,740
- What's the mattress worth?

126
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,012
- Uh, that's a box spring.

127
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:48,845
- Okay.

128
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:49,680
- [Chris] Oh, he is a professional.

129
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,513
- Five bucks.

130
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:52,290
- We saved the most
valuable item for last.

131
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,550
A full bagel.

132
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,020
Not eaten, in a bag.

133
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,950
- I'd give you 50 cent.

134
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,420
- Weddle is at $29.

135
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,583
You're at $56.

136
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,480
You are killing the game.
- A sword.

137
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,678
- All right, to the next one.

138
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:03,690
(upbeat music)

139
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,100
- [Weddle] I'm claiming this sofa.

140
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,906
- This is dumpster number five.

141
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:09,660
(Weddle squeaks and spittles)

142
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,970
- You guys better your
get cameras for this.

143
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,110
- [Jimmy] Oh!

144
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,460
- Box of stuffed animals.

145
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,293
- I'm here to help.

146
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:16,650
This is actually kind of valuable.

147
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,970
So what would you say this is worth?

148
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,170
- Three, four bucks for that.

149
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,150
- What would you say these
stuffed animals are worth?

150
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,983
- Eight bucks.

151
00:03:21,983 --> 00:03:23,550
- And finally, what
everyone wants to know.

152
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,860
This guitar, it's slightly gross.

153
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,970
What would you say it's worth?

154
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,530
- If the electronics are working,

155
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,820
I'd give you 90 bucks for it.

156
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,980
- Ooh.
- Oh!

157
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,660
- Sadness.

158
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,493
- What about the sofa?

159
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:35,326
Its a soft sofa.

160
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:36,540
- It's very soft.
- And wet.

161
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,710
- It might be worth 10 bucks.

162
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,543
- Okay.

163
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:39,690
Weddle is now up to $140.

164
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,220
Chris is still on $56.

165
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,170
- Apparently, we like guitars

166
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,250
more than swords around here.

167
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,120
- And calculators.

168
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,953
- I got jibbed.

169
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:46,890
- Who cares? Next one.

170
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,150
- Chris.
- This has nothing in it.

171
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,020
- That's nothing.

172
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,370
- I see something.

173
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,380
You know what, I'm really
sad Chandler's not here.

174
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,990
He would appraise these
frosted flakes for a lot.

175
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,580
That's not a bad hat, actually.

176
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,290
- This right here is Chandler 2.0.

177
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,270
We FaceTimed Chandler,

178
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,190
because he's preparing for the hospital.

179
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,300
'Cause he has surgery coming up.

180
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,580
Since he's getting ready for
surgery, he can't be here.

181
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,870
So we're gonna FaceTime him,

182
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,970
and he is now Chandler 2.0.

183
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,380
So when we were dumpster diving,

184
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,300
we found a bag of frosted flakes.

185
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,200
What's that worth?

186
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,460
- Uh, at least $3.

187
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,140
- Here's your $3 frosted flakes.

188
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,580
- Oh great and almighty Chandler.

189
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,766
What is this lamp worth?

190
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:19,777
- $35!

191
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:20,760
- $35?

192
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,850
What about this soggy, wasted, worn hat?

193
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,050
- That's $15 right there.

194
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,190
- [Jimmy] Oh. Pillowcase?

195
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,210
- [Chris] A nasty pillow case.

196
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,993
- [Jimmy] It can be used to make a ghost.

197
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:30,000
- A dollar.

198
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,930
- I agree with the dollar.

199
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,763
The rest of it...

200
00:04:31,763 --> 00:04:33,420
He's definitely not a professional.

201
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,130
- [Jimmy] We didn't go into
quite a few of the dumpsters,

202
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,280
because they were either
empty or extremely gross.

203
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,450
- There's nothing in here.

204
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,680
But to my left,

205
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,530
there's a really comfy looking love couch.

206
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,120
- What would you say the value is?

207
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,190
- 13 bucks, it's a little nicer

208
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,023
- All right.
- than that other couch.

209
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:49,200
- I don't think there's anything in mine

210
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,030
other than just actual trash.
- Oh.

211
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,990
- Can you appraise this?

212
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,830
- I'd give you a dollar.

213
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,151
- Nailed it.

214
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:56,580
(upbeat music)

215
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,990
- Before you hop in the dumpster.

216
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,823
- Yeah, yeah.

217
00:04:58,823 --> 00:04:59,656
- What is all this outside it?

218
00:04:59,656 --> 00:05:01,290
- [Weddle] Look at this nice couch!

219
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,850
- Another half chair.

220
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,290
All right.
- Whoa.

221
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,123
- [Jimmy] Monitor.

222
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:06,060
What would you say this is worth?

223
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,080
- 45 bucks.

224
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,913
- [Weddle] Nice!

225
00:05:07,913 --> 00:05:08,940
- Well, what do you think
this monitor's worth?

226
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,050
- 30.

227
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,730
- [Jimmy] What about
this flipped over couch?

228
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,563
- Five bucks.

229
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:13,555
- Okay.
- Fair enough.

230
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:15,540
- $221.
- Woo!

231
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,970
So far, you are killing Chris.

232
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,803
- I want to go home.

233
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:19,680
- I didn't know it spins?!

234
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,000
- Yeah, it does spin.

235
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,833
- Do you wanna add value

236
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:22,810
now that you know it spins?
- Nope, it's already-

237
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,690
Nope, he said it.
- I'll add 10 bucks.

238
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,040
- No!

239
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,873
I want to go home.

240
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:27,706
- Next dumpster.

241
00:05:27,706 --> 00:05:29,910
- Ew, get away from that.
- No.

242
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,080
- [Weddle] Oh, this is looking like a dud.

243
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,913
- [Jimmy] Nothing.

244
00:05:31,913 --> 00:05:33,729
That's a hardy nope.
- Oh my gosh.

245
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,430
- Oh!
- I see some shoes.

246
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,740
- Got some really good dress shoes here.

247
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,690
I got a pair of mismatched vans.

248
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,340
More nice dress shoes, man.

249
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,230
- Wow this-
- Oh, this is a good haul.

250
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,910
- At least 15 bucks.

251
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,743
I'll give 13.

252
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:46,710
12.

253
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, those are a little more worn.

254
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,380
I'd just give those 10.

255
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,220
- With a pop socket!

256
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,546
- Pop socket makes it nine.
- Nice!

257
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:53,970
- [Weddle] Yeah, what's
Chris at, what am I at?

258
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,625
- The totals are on the top of the screen.

259
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,880
- Oh, okay.

260
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,020
- What if-
- He was like,

261
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,010
you guys are idiots,

262
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,870
Ethan put it right there.

263
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,130
- [Jimmy] Oh, it's literally nothing.

264
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:02,963
- [Chris] Good dumpster!

265
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:03,840
- There's nothing here.

266
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,673
Nothing.

267
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:07,530
Only one of you is
walking away with $10,000.

268
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,200
I'm gonna raise it to $12,000.

269
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,033
- Huh!

270
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:11,866
- Yeah, I see Q-tips,

271
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:12,699
I see (indistinct).

272
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,430
- Are these chairs?

273
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,600
It is a chair.
- It works.

274
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,420
- What do you think the mattress is worth?

275
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,253
- 25 bucks.

276
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,086
- [Jimmy] Beat up chair.

277
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:20,280
- That's at least 15 bucks.

278
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,173
- Propane tank.
- 12 bucks.

279
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,680
- You can get 'em refilled.

280
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,570
On Pawn Stars they have to call their guy.

281
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,403
Call your guy.

282
00:06:25,403 --> 00:06:26,730
Are you sure?
- Don't give it to 'em.

283
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,260
- He's saying 20.

284
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,130
- Okay, I'm fine with that.

285
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,829
- [Man] Times that by
two, there's a second one.

286
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:33,296
- Oh!
- Oh, there is a second one.

287
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:34,129
- That's more.
- This

288
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:35,790
is probably worth about 25.

289
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,633
- Hey, I'll take it!

290
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:37,560
- Woo!
- Chris

291
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,563
just demolished you.

292
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:39,396
- I did.

293
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:40,229
I did just get destroyed.

294
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:41,400
- 29 looks like a bust.

295
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,590
Nothing in here except for a pillow.

296
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,880
I don't really want to go after a pillow,

297
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,616
because there's a big ticket item.

298
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:47,970
(Chris groans)

299
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,560
- Mr. Appraiser, what
do you think it's worth?

300
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,520
- 40 bucks.

301
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,780
- There's nothing in here either.

302
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,190
There's really nothing in here.

303
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,800
- Look how empty it is in here!

304
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,850
- I think I'm gonna get outta here.

305
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,683
Oh wow.

306
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:58,516
Some milk.

307
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:00,360
- You have $330 so far.

308
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,470
You have $231.

309
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,303
- Yep.

310
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:04,260
- We called in Chandler 2.0 again.

311
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,870
Chandler, you have $100 credit.

312
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,010
Who do you want to give it to?

313
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,510
You can give 50-50.

314
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,440
You give it all to one.

315
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,273
Chris is winning,

316
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:12,870
by a hundred exactly.

317
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,520
- Well, let's make it a tie.

318
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,690
- [Weddle] Ooh.

319
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,740
- [Chris] Good luck with your surgery.

320
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,730
I hope it goes terrible.

321
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,100
- Thank you, oh great and
almighty Chandler 2.0.

322
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,933
You can go.

323
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:21,870
- Because you did that,

324
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,607
your surgery will go well.

325
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:26,190
(upbeat music)

326
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,770
- The only thing my dumpster has in it

327
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,730
is ants.

328
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,260
- This is dumpster 45.

329
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,090
That's dumpster 46.

330
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,230
- I want those cherries.

331
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,112
Tomato cherries.

332
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:35,945
Got 'em.

333
00:07:35,945 --> 00:07:36,778
- [Jimmy] Ooh, is that a pen?

334
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:37,860
Pen for the-
- That looks good.

335
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,693
- middle school.

336
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:39,900
- Weddle found some cherry tomatoes.

337
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,733
What is that worth?

338
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:41,566
There's an ant in it.

339
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:42,930
- [Appraiser] That actually
increases the value.

340
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,339
I'd give that 10 bucks.

341
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,172
- Nice!

342
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:46,110
- Chris found the pen.

343
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,250
- [Appraiser] Uh, five bucks.

344
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,660
- So there's two dumpsters.

345
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,860
You guys have had a long day.

346
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,910
- We have.
- I want you to pick,

347
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,680
and I'll search both for you guys.

348
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,649
- Oh, wow.
- Really?

349
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:54,676
- Okay.
- I call this one.

350
00:07:54,676 --> 00:07:55,530
- All right, I'll get that guy over there.

351
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,360
- All right, you guys
wanna just sit there?

352
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,770
Can someone get them some water?

353
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,640
Here you go, gentlemen.

354
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,660
- Oh, wow.
- Here's some water.

355
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,493
Here's some money.

356
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:02,550
Just feel free to split it.

357
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,410
- Wait, aren't you also the appraiser?

358
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,580
- Yeah.
- Wait a second.

359
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,080
- There's a giant furniture thing.

360
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,370
I can't get it out.

361
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,383
Oh, Chris, we found the mother load.

362
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:12,845
(bomb explodes)

363
00:08:12,845 --> 00:08:13,678
Oh!

364
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:14,511
- It's knowledge!

365
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:15,960
- [Chris] Who would throw
away all these books?

366
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,018
- Hey, hey, more about me.

367
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:19,170
(men laugh)

368
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,003
Go sit down.

369
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:20,836
I got this.

370
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:21,669
- [Weddle] Sorry, I can't.

371
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,220
- [Jimmy] Do you see anything
I should be searching?

372
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,053
- [Weddle] Oh god, um...

373
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:26,040
- [Jimmy] Oh, here's a package.

374
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,873
It's empty.

375
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:27,706
- What's over there?

376
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:28,696
Something looks wrapped up.
- It's empty.

377
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:29,529
- [Weddle] It's empty?

378
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:31,680
- Our appraiser apparently
had a lunch date

379
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,520
with his grandma.

380
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,390
- What a loser.

381
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,223
- Dork.

382
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,670
- So I'm taking over for the appraiser.

383
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,200
Chris, you found a lot of books.

384
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,033
- [Chris] Yes.

385
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,774
- This book is worth $10.

386
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:41,490
(bell dings repeatedly)

387
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,540
- It's a book of jokes!

388
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,687
- [Jimmy] How much would
you pay for those jokes?

389
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:44,880
- $100.

390
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,290
- Let me try out one of the jokes,

391
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,895
and then you tell me what
it's worth, all right?

392
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:48,757
- Yeah, and if they're funny
- All right, let's find out

393
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:49,680
how funny this is.
- then we're good.

394
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,780
- Why was the belt arrested?

395
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,940
Because it held up a pair of pants.

396
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,900
- Based off that joke.

397
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,010
The books worth 30 bucks.

398
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,417
These cushions are $2.50 a pop.

399
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:00,150
- What kind of coat does a house wear?

400
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,444
A coat of paint.

401
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:02,850
(Chris laughs)

402
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,380
- All right, it's now $25.

403
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,810
The total from this dumpster was 96 bucks.

404
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,451
Let's see what Weddle's got.

405
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:09,284
Having fun?

406
00:09:09,284 --> 00:09:10,117
- I got bubble wrap!

407
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,370
- But that's not even real bubble wrap.

408
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,554
Look, you can't pop it.

409
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:13,620
(bubble wrap pops)

410
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,910
- [Jimmy] Someone found bubble wrap.

411
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,743
What is it worth?

412
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:16,890
- [Chandler 2.0] A dollar per bubble

413
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,940
that is still intact.

414
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,960
- [Jimmy] Well, how about 50 cents?

415
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,100
That seems more reasonable.

416
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,933
I'm gonna round up,

417
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:21,766
I'm gonna say 40.

418
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:23,070
- Nice, keep it competitive.
- Wait, hold on.

419
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,390
How many is in a line?

420
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,952
- If you do this, you're gonna regret it.

421
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:27,960
- All right, $40.

422
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,790
- So these are currently the numbers.

423
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,870
You're at $421.

424
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,703
What do you wanna do?

425
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:32,820
- I wanna give him a dollar.

426
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,810
- I'm at $385.
- Okay.

427
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,980
Yours just went down a dollar.

428
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,813
- Yeah, that's fine.

429
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:36,930
Now it's $420.

430
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,763
Nice.

431
00:09:37,763 --> 00:09:39,120
(whimsical music)

432
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,710
I found a bike back here earlier

433
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,030
and I've been waiting.

434
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,230
- It's a rust bucket.

435
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,190
It does work though.

436
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,420
- What a dream!

437
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,410
- I got chargers!

438
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,550
And I got this sofa.

439
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,200
- Chris, bring your bike on back here.

440
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,070
- Oh, I'm not done yet.

441
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,903
I found this.

442
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:52,357
It's near the trash.

443
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:53,707
- $70 for the bike.

444
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:54,990
$40 for the ladder.

445
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,830
- I'm killing it.

446
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,875
- And a couch.

447
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,073
- Okay, so, that's $3.

448
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:00,690
This is a nice couch.

449
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,650
60 bucks.

450
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,483
- Okay.

451
00:10:02,483 --> 00:10:03,750
- [Chris] There's a leg missing.

452
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,583
- The leg is missing.

453
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,416
It's not 50 bucks.

454
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,900
Chris is at $530.

455
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,250
You're at $430.

456
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,083
- I am.

457
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,730
(whimsical music continues)

458
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,280
- So this is dumpster number 55.

459
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,113
- A duck!

460
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:15,960
- Oh my goodness.

461
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,157
How much would you pay for it?

462
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:18,990
- Oh my god!
- 25 bucks for it.

463
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,430
- Whoa.
- Ducks!

464
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,980
- That means you just got $75.

465
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,460
- I would only pay like $10 for this one.

466
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,460
- All right, that's everything in here.

467
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,260
- If you had $100, who
would you give it to?

468
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,306
- The yellow hat.

469
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:30,630
- That's what I get for-
- Yellow hat guy?

470
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,890
- [Weddle] Wait, you throwing away the TV?

471
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,723
- Yeah.

472
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,760
- Oh no, he threw away a TV.

473
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,925
Here I go.

474
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:37,842
Hey Jimjam!

475
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,313
Oh!

476
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:41,250
- 70 bucks.

477
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,189
- All right.

478
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:43,284
(whimsical music)

479
00:10:43,284 --> 00:10:46,617
(bell dings repeatedly)

480
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,440
- 69!
- Number 69!

481
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,294
Nice!

482
00:10:50,294 --> 00:10:51,127
(whimsical music continues)

483
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:54,210
(bell continues to ding repeatedly)

484
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,437
- Oh, what is that?

485
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:56,460
- Oh!
- Doesn't smell at all.

486
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,293
- I could give that to a kid!

487
00:10:57,293 --> 00:10:58,530
- Can I give it to my girlfriend

488
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,363
as a present?

489
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:00,466
- Yes, you can.
- Worth 50 bucks.

490
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:01,299
- Nice!

491
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:02,640
That's a nice TV right there.

492
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,840
- This TV's pretty thick.

493
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,520
- I'd give you 90 bucks for it.

494
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,780
- [Chris] 90 bucks, that's fair.

495
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,340
- That was a spicy meme.

496
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,600
- I'll give you two bucks for that.

497
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,470
- I'll take it.
- Wow.

498
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,850
Who wants to get in the dumpster?

499
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,649
Pay you like 50 bucks
at the end of the day.

500
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:15,780
- It's a full box of lettuce.

501
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,817
Nice water bottle.

502
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:17,650
- Ooh!

503
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,780
What do you think about my salad?

504
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,710
Here, I'll toss it.

505
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,570
- [Jimmy] There we go.
- Eight bucks.

506
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,460
I'd say 25 with the customization.

507
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,510
- There we go.

508
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,830
- You are losing, Chris.

509
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,757
So take your pick.

510
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:28,131
- Okay, got her, this one.

511
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:28,964
- Really, that one?

512
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:30,420
- Hey, this is a mattress topper.

513
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,768
These are worth a lot of money.

514
00:11:31,768 --> 00:11:34,290
(upbeat music)

515
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,850
- Chris had a massive haul.

516
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:36,750
- He has a living room.

517
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,837
- What would you say this is worth?

518
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:39,060
- $13.

519
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,990
- Big table?

520
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,730
- Easily worth 55 bucks.

521
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,710
- All right.
- 55? Okay.

522
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,240
- 18 bucks for the gas can.

523
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,130
- 35 bucks for the-
- 35?

524
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,150
- 19, 20 bucks.

525
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,983
I give it 20 bucks.

526
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:50,010
- We'll do 20.
- 20.

527
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:50,843
- Wow.

528
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,440
- Chris, you are currently in the lead.

529
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,900
Weddle, there's only 15 dumpsters left.

530
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,733
And as of right now,
- I know.

531
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:57,540
- Chris would walk away with 12 grand.

532
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,090
How do you feel now that
you could win $12,000?

533
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:00,923
- Better.

534
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:02,130
- This dumpster is so big,

535
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,660
we're actually gonna count it as four.

536
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,483
Weddle and Chris get to
go in at the same time.

537
00:12:07,704 --> 00:12:09,300
(indistinct overlapping chatter)

538
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,410
- For your plants.

539
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,340
- [Cameraman] Chris,
why are you out of this

540
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,630
big dumpster already?

541
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,610
- I'm terrified of rats.

542
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,750
And I saw a rat.

543
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,540
And so I refuse to go
anywhere near this dumpster.

544
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,470
- I'll carry the torch.

545
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,910
This lot will close at,

546
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,743
what does that say?

547
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:22,890
- [Man] 8:00 AM on 9.16

548
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,577
left cars will be towed.

549
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,410
- Here you go, Chris.

550
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,243
- [Chris] Thanks.

551
00:12:26,243 --> 00:12:27,076
- Let's start off with Chris.

552
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:27,909
What is this worth?

553
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:29,490
- Well, seeing as it's only worth anything

554
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,080
on one day outta the year,

555
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,580
I'll give you 10 bucks.

556
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,960
- And my planter?

557
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,793
- Seven.

558
00:12:34,793 --> 00:12:35,760
- Sweet.
- Pretty good.

559
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,593
This crap?

560
00:12:36,593 --> 00:12:38,160
- Chains are actually pretty expensive.

561
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,960
So I'd probably give you 20 bucks

562
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,580
for a broken chain.
(Weddle laughs)

563
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,350
- There's a sprocket and a little filter.

564
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,760
All right, I'd give you
five bucks for that.

565
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,840
And five bucks for-
- I'm gonna give you $5

566
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,690
'cause he knows what a
sprite, sprok, sprocket is.

567
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,190
- It's a sprocket right there.

568
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,023
- Eight for that.

569
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:53,313
- Chris is currently in the lead by $37.

570
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,630
So if this trend continues,

571
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,160
Chris is gonna win the 12 grand.

572
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,720
There are three dumpsters here.

573
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,553
Two of them are Weddle's.

574
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:03,000
One of them is Chris.

575
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,110
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

576
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,949
- Hey!

577
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:06,090
- [Chris] Ooh!

578
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,190
- Listen. Listen, dad.

579
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,420
- [Jimmy] Wow.

580
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,891
- Oh my god!

581
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:11,970
- Heelys!
- Heelys.

582
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,432
- We have like 20,000.

583
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:14,265
- That's too much.

584
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:15,098
- That's two bucks.

585
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:17,130
- Weddle got 60 bucks for his bubble wrap.

586
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,370
- But my bubbles were better!

587
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,650
I had better bubbles!
- I'm not saying

588
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,453
there's cheating going on, but-

589
00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:23,040
- What do you say this TV is worth?

590
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,000
- It was a hundred bucks.

591
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,470
- All right, Chris.
- Heelys?!

592
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,520
Are you kidding me?!

593
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,690
- Five bucks for 'em.

594
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,523
For the box.

595
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:29,356
Just the box.

596
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:30,189
- Let's move on to Weddle.

597
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:31,680
- [Weddle] All what's this worth?

598
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,887
- An umbrella? 35 bucks.

599
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:33,847
- $35.

600
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:34,980
- I'll give you eight bucks for the box.

601
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,840
But the stuff in the box-

602
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,953
- We got a candle.

603
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:38,389
- Eight bucks for the candle.

604
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,320
(bell dings repeatedly)

605
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,910
- Nine more dumpsters

606
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,620
stand between you guys and 12 grand.

607
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,453
- Nine!

608
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:45,540
Hey!

609
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,160
That's a Victoria's Secret purse.

610
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,750
- They call us ranch,

611
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,160
'cause we be dressing.

612
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,240
- I see it's Hidden Valley.

613
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,286
So I don't even know how you found it.

614
00:13:53,286 --> 00:13:54,119
(both laugh)

615
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:55,020
Three bucks.

616
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,790
For the one that doesn't look used.

617
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,110
- E.C.U. t-shirt.

618
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,720
- Wash 'em, and I'd give
you 10 bucks for the pair.

619
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,950
And what about our clothes hamper?

620
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,821
- All right, five bucks.

621
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:03,654
- All right.

622
00:14:03,654 --> 00:14:05,190
- Again, you want to
put your kids in a room

623
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,371
but you don't want to deal with 'em?

624
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:07,238
- $15.

625
00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:08,370
- $15, nice.

626
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,203
We have-

627
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:11,640
- Eight bucks for these two.
- Those two.

628
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,810
- 10 bucks.
- Nice.

629
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,980
- Since Chris is winning.

630
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,813
You can pick.

631
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,080
- Nice.

632
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,913
What is this bread worth?

633
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:18,360
- $2.

634
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,258
- What's this worth?

635
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,091
- Nine bucks.

636
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:20,924
- Nine bucks, okay.

637
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:22,243
What's this? This is for a microwave.

638
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:24,180
- Six bucks.
- Universal fit.

639
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,230
- Here's the scores.

640
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,317
Five more.

641
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:27,720
96, 97, 98.

642
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,638
Chris gets all the evens.

643
00:14:29,638 --> 00:14:32,070
(bright music)

644
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,487
You each have one more dumpster.

645
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:35,614
$12,000 is on the line.

646
00:14:35,614 --> 00:14:36,447
- Appraise me.
- Appraise him.

647
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:37,280
- Is there a disc in this?

648
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,113
- Don't open it.

649
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:38,946
Don't open it!

650
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:39,779
- No disc.

651
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,620
- Why did you open it?

652
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,130
- Wouldn't say trash, but three bucks.

653
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,590
- Three bucks.
- Three bucks!

654
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,423
- There's shoes in here.

655
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:45,256
Don't open it.

656
00:14:45,256 --> 00:14:47,456
It's a nice shoe box, so two bucks.

657
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:48,390
- It's a poop box.

658
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,223
It's a litter box.

659
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:50,640
I've got hangable blinds.

660
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,473
- Seven.

661
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,453
Six.

662
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:56,168
That's probably seven
bucks a piece, honestly.

663
00:14:56,168 --> 00:14:58,424
(tense music)

664
00:14:58,424 --> 00:14:59,424
- $1,479.69.

665
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,687
Weddle, $1,415.

666
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:09,510
$57.79 stand between you and 12 grand.

667
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,950
Final two dumpsters.

668
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,140
I'm thinking of a number
between one and two.

669
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,973
Pick a number.

670
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:15,060
- One.
- One and a half.

671
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,893
- Obviously he picks two,

672
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:16,860
'cause it's the only thing left.

673
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,240
- Okay, that's what was in my hand.

674
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,170
- I would've won anyway.

675
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,160
- Which one do you want?

676
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,180
- This one, it's got its roof on.

677
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,050
It's a mystery.

678
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,250
Oh, that's an empty one!

679
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,803
- That's worth a lot.

680
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,220
It's busted.
- It's pretty.

681
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,020
- First is a Just Fab's shoebox.

682
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,850
If you've ever wanted to feel Just Fab,

683
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,140
look at it, who's just fab?

684
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,973
You are.

685
00:15:34,973 --> 00:15:35,806
- A dollar.
- All right.

686
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:37,350
- A dollar.
- All right.

687
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,640
- Leather phone case.

688
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,300
- That's a good 25 bucks, right there.

689
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,400
- There you go.

690
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,570
On eBay, iPhone XS
boxes are going for $40.

691
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,403
- [Weddle] Just the box?

692
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,180
- Just the box.
- Yeah.

693
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,620
- So, 30 bucks for the box.

694
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,150
- And next, police caution tape.

695
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,980
You can hang it on your
door for Halloween.

696
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,813
- A dollar.

697
00:15:53,813 --> 00:15:54,646
- A dollar.

698
00:15:54,646 --> 00:15:56,220
- Mr. Appraiser, come on over here.

699
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,300
- A shower curtain.

700
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,230
- Three bucks.

701
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,130
- Fair enough.

702
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,090
- Two bucks.

703
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,252
- Olive oil.

704
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,190
- Olive oil.
- Olive oil bottle.

705
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,390
69 cent.

706
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,710
- Nice, finally.
- Nice, nice.

707
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,060
Before we reveal the totals,

708
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,370
I wanted to teleport us to
the warehouse real quick,

709
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,320
with all the items they found,

710
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,153
so you could see.

711
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:14,640
Chris, on this $1 bill
is written your total.

712
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,870
This is your total.

713
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,790
Weddle, please read us your total.

714
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,180
- I found $1,421.59

715
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,013
worth.
- Chris,

716
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:23,846
what was your dumpsters worth?

717
00:16:23,846 --> 00:16:28,846
- $1,531.69.

718
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,210
I haven't won in so long.

719
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,170
It feels so good.

720
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,003
10 smackeroonies.

721
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:32,940
- Yeah!

722
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,578
- That's $10,000.

723
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:35,974
