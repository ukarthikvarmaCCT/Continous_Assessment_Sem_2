Friends, all of you often talk about

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,500
your laptops, computers , mobile phones about the type of processor, display , battery.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,420
how much storage and RAM it has.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,200
and think that increasing RAM and storage will make it great.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,820
But, here comes the question that we are going to discuss today in this video.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:34,560
that whether increasing the size of RAM has any real practical benefit or should we also take a look at the speed of the RAM

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,940
Hello friends, my name is Gaurav. You are watching Technical Guruji. Lets begin.

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,400
Friends, RAM is something which we are able to discuss very easily with our friends.

11
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,480
because it is easy to understand like 1GB, 2GB , 5GB.

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,940
but if it is a complex term, which a common man can't understand then maybe people won't talk about it so much.

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,660
For example, people don't generally talk about the Cache memory because

14
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,800
a common person doesn't know the role of a Cache memory

15
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,900
Now whether it is 2MB Cache or 4MB Cache, he doesn't really care.

16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,740
Yes. But people understand RAM. 1GB, 2GB, 3GB, the more the better.

17
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,240
and on the basis of this thinking we keep deciding about the devices

18
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,040
I remember my first android phone , which was Samsung Galaxy S2, it only had 1 GB RAM

19
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,200
There were many phones available in the market below this as well at the time

20
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:42,120
And now we have 2,3,4,5,6 and now we even hear the rumors that upcoming phone will be 8GB RAM, 16GB RAM

21
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:49,000
And all we are focusing on is to increase this number further. But have you ever thought,

22
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,280
whether we practically need this much RAM or not?

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:02:02,060
Suppose today if you want to build a PC at home to play games, 8 GB RAM is all you need. All the games work smoothly on that

24
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,020
But as we are always looking for the best, so despite it costing more

25
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,620
we will go for 32 GB RAM, 64 GB RAM.

26
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,620
does the RAM whether 8GB or 32 GB play any role in the performance of the game?

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,040
Not really.

28
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,920
So guys, there is a thing called RAM capacity.

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:29,640
Suppose I am the processor and the table is the RAM and whatever I am working on, I have already called it here.

30
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,260
Everything else is stored in the cupboard which is actually the Hard Drive.

31
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,160
Now suppose if this table was very large, still my hands can reach this space only.

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,000
so only this RAM is of my use.

33
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:49,040
Or if suppose the jobs at my hand are small enough to fit this space, then I don't really need a table that big.

34
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,380
So, after a limit, the remaining RAM is a waste and you are not really able to use that resource.

35
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:07,520
but if suppose, this table starts throwing object that I need in the job towards me, so that I am able to work with more speed

36
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,400
that is in simple language, the RAM has become fast

37
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,140
the data transfer between the RAM and Processor is taking place faster

38
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,860
so this will be beneficial to you instead of just increasing the size of the table again and again

39
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,700
4,6,8,15,25 , people keep on increasing RAM and then think that their device is faster.

40
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:37,600
So here we need to think a bit practically. I understand that the table/ RAM is sufficient for you today

41
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,000
but it might not be enough in 2 years time with improvement in the softwares.

42
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:58,440
I understand that after sometime you need to upgrade your phone or PC whatever it is , but we need to see where we are getting the best value currently.

43
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,820
You need to see the specifications of the RAM. How many Mega Hertz is its speed, whether DDR3 stick is used or DDR4 stick is used.

44
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:12,380
Whether your phone has DDR3 RAM or DDR4 RAM or what does your processor supports best, where you will get the best optimization

45
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,960
We sometimes ignore these things and just keep running behind MORE.

46
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,440
Bro! I am using 64 GB RAM.

47
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,380
For what purpose? Games.

48
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,560
You could have played the same game on 8GB RAM as well

49
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,680
These are few things that we need to keep in mind.

50
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,640
You can tell me in the comment section below about your views on this blind race

51
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,740
I mean, we don't even know the finish point of this race. We don't even know why are we in this race. But we are just running behind the numbers

52
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,900
The same thing goes with the storage

53
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,500
People say , I have a hard drive of 2TB

54
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,220
Now if same person is told that I have a Solid State Drive (SSD) of 256 GB

55
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,600
capacity is less than Hard Drive but performance is many times better, then he might not be able to understand it

56
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:03,500
so, here we need to have these things in mind, that not only we choose the best possible technology for ourselves but also understand why are we choosing it

57
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:11,220
Friends, you can tell me about any such experiences you have had faced with any friend or with some relative

58
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,780
where they were fighting over the numbers.

59
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,780
