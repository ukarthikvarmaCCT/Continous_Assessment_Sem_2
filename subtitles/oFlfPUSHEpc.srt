00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,117
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,117 --> 00:00:03,462
Recently I made a video on the film Animal,

3
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:06,043
in which I called it a cancer for society.

4
00:00:06,043 --> 00:00:09,538
After watching it, some people asked, 
'What about toxic feminism?'

5
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:12,382
Are feminist films not bad for society?

6
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:14,316
So come, in this video, let's know about

7
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:16,736
feminism and patriarchy in depth in detail.

8
00:00:16,736 --> 00:00:18,510
What is Feminism?

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,458
How does feminism impact our society?

10
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:25,320
And how are men suffering because of it?

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,671
"Feminine gender, masculine gender, neutral,

12
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:29,235
in Hindi, it is known as 'Streeling' and 'Puling,'

13
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:30,648
those words have now being

14
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:32,622
given a new meaning."

15
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,216
Often on social media,

16
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:39,385
whenever we talk about topics like 
masculinity, patriarchy, and feminism,

17
00:00:39,385 --> 00:00:41,465
you must have heard people saying that

18
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:45,578
these girls, these women or these boys are always like this.

19
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,438
Such arguments are raised a lot

20
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:49,452
that girls are at fault in many instances,

21
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:52,086
that women do this and that.

22
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:55,949
It's as if a Team Boys and Team Girls are opposing each other.

23
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:57,916
All the men are in one team

24
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,557
and women are in the other team.

25
00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:01,744
Think about it, is it not strange?

26
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:04,632
That males and females are always divided into two different teams.

27
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:10,121
Every house has a mother, a daughter, a sister, or a wife.

28
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:12,084
So while using such arguments,

29
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:15,373
how can we say things like, 
"girls are always like this"

30
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:17,039
or that "women are always like this."

31
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:21,156
On the other hand, it doesn't make sense 
to group all men into one team.

32
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:23,589
There are men who throw acid on girls

33
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:25,386
if she refuses them.

34
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,905
Would you like to be in the same team with them?

35
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:30,151
The real division that exists here is

36
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:33,640
between patriarchal people and feminist people.

37
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,445
What do these words mean?

38
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:37,620
Let's take a look at the dictionary.

39
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,511
Patriarchy is a social system

40
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:42,544
where men have control over women.

41
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:44,576
In Hindi, patriarchy can be called as

42
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:46,947
Purush Pradhan Samajik Vyavastha.
[Male-dominated social structure]

43
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:50,093
A system where all power is held by men.

44
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:52,491
So what is the definition of Feminism?

45
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:54,225
Does Feminism mean a society

46
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:56,474
where the power is in the hands of women?

47
00:01:56,474 --> 00:01:57,230
No.

48
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,020
The definition of feminism is something else.

49
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,627
Feminism is an ideology

50
00:02:00,627 --> 00:02:04,371
which believes that there should be

51
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:07,909
political, economic, and social 
equality between men and women. 

52
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:12,627
Women should be given equal 
rights and opportunities as men.

53
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:15,515
So even though the word Feminism 
is derived from the word Female,

54
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:16,817
it doesn't mean that

55
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:19,653
women are given more power than men.

56
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:22,719
There's another word for that, Matriarchy.

57
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,139
This is the equivalent of Patriarchy. 

58
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,440
Where men are considered superior to women in Patriarchy,

59
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,722
in Matriarchy, women are considered superior to men.

60
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:33,846
But Feminism means that

61
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:37,237
there is no discrimination between the two genders.

62
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:38,577
Now you must be thinking,

63
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:42,375
does this mean that a man can also be a feminist?

64
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,683
Absolutely.

65
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:46,266
In fact, any rational and sensible man

66
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,540
will be a Feminist.

67
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,702
Former US President Barack Obama once wrote an essay

68
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:53,171
in which he called himself a Feminist.

69
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:56,646
When the legendary author Salman Rushdie was asked

70
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:59,012
if he was a feminist, he replied,

71
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,025
"Yes, what else is there to be?"

72
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:03,946
Either you are a feminist or a fool.

73
00:03:03,946 --> 00:03:05,805
These are the only choices.

74
00:03:05,805 --> 00:03:09,435
When Hollywood filmmaker Darren 
Aronofsky was asked the same question,

75
00:03:09,435 --> 00:03:11,893
he replied, that it was a stupid question.

76
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:13,456
Of course, he is a feminist.

77
00:03:13,456 --> 00:03:16,973
Indian actor Rahul Bose had a similar answer to this question.

78
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:18,911
He said, of course, he is a feminist.

79
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:22,967
Anyone who believes in humanity, 
naturally is a feminist.

80
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:25,155
Several famous male celebrities

81
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,947
openly call themselves Feminists.

82
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:29,847
Hollywood actors Chris Hemsworth, Ryan Gosling,

83
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:31,589
in the Indian film industry,

84
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:33,120
Farhan Akhtar, Aamir Khan.

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,150
Often they have talked about the issue

86
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,391
that men and women should be given equal rights.

87
00:03:38,391 --> 00:03:39,934
But the next question is

88
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:42,319
can women be patriarchal?

89
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,837
The answer to this is yes, absolutely.

90
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:47,569
There was a documentary called The World Before Her.

91
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,628
I would like to show you a clip from it.

92
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,259
Vishwa Hindu Parishad had organised 
a Durga Vahini camp for women.

93
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:02,693
The instructor was a woman.

94
00:04:02,693 --> 00:04:04,072
She is asking the girls,

95
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:06,930
is it really necessary for them to leave their houses?

96
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,240
Make a career?

97
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,310
Is it truly necessary?

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,985
This way of thinking goes against common sense.

99
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:17,574
Why would a woman choose to have inequal rights?

100
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:18,970
But the truth is,

101
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,084
many women in our country
have these patriarchal ideologies.

102
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:24,351
It is all due to Social Conditioning.

103
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:26,163
In this video, the woman tells how

104
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:29,013
her mother slapped her in her childhood

105
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:31,410
when she saw herself in the mirror.

106
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,070
She was told that knowing how to read and write is enough.

107
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,142
She doesn't need higher education.

108
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:39,744
There are many reasons for such 
patriarchal views all over the world.

109
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:41,465
Like, 'this is our tradition,'

110
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:42,620
our culture,

111
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,354
or our religion teaches us this.

112
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:48,179
In society, people often have strong opinions about

113
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:50,601
how an ideal woman should be.

114
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:52,427
While the husband is the incarnation of God.

115
00:04:52,427 --> 00:04:55,879
ABP News had quoted Garud Puran in its article

116
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,464
that a good wife is the one who

117
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,906
follows her husband's orders.

118
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:01,967
For a wife, heaven is at her husband's feet.

119
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:05,811
For any woman, her family's happiness is her happiness.

120
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,987
A woman is incomplete without becoming a mother.

121
00:05:07,987 --> 00:05:11,521
You must have often heard people 
around you saying these things.

122
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:13,567
A woman is made up of her sacrifices.

123
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,499
If there are 4 slices of cake left

124
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:16,920
and there are 5 people,

125
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,849
then a woman would always say that

126
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:20,695
she doesn't like cake and asks the others to go ahead.

127
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,063
What else is commonly said?

128
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:25,026
If a girl studies more, 
she will get out of hand.

129
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:27,673
It doesn't look good for girls to laugh loudly.

130
00:05:27,673 --> 00:05:30,524
A girl should be homely and well-behaved.

131
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:33,440
Such things are very common in our society.

132
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,357
And the mass media encourages these.

133
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:39,321
These so-called ideal daughter-in-law characters

134
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,420
in Ekta Kapoor's TV serials.

135
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,606
Always portrays regressive thinking about women.

136
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:48,865
Or watch Sandeep Vanga's films like 
Animal or Kabir Singh.

137
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:50,948
These affect our societyas

138
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:55,444
many girls want to fit into this 'ideal woman' standard

139
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:57,440
and start accepting these views.

140
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,984
They do this so that

141
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,284
they get accepted by society and their family.

142
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:06,298
In psychology, this phenomenon is 
known as Normative Conformity.

143
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:10,098
In school, when teenagers often 
become victims of peer pressure,

144
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:11,499
it's because of this phenomenon.

145
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:13,694
An example of this on a smaller scale can be that

146
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:15,906
if you are sitting in a group 
and someone is making a joke.

147
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,727
Everyone starts laughing at that joke.

148
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:20,207
But you don't find that joke funny.

149
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:22,450
You don't want to laugh at the joke.

150
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,964
But you choose to laugh

151
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:26,863
so that you can be a part of that group.

152
00:06:26,863 --> 00:06:30,386
So that you can conform to the standards of the group.

153
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:32,611
Normative conformity.

154
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:37,829
Many women adopt these patriarchal 
ideas to gain acceptance in society.

155
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:40,160
This is why throughout history,

156
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,052
we have seen many women

157
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:46,019
who were protesting against women's equal rights.

158
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:47,975
In the video on Napoleon, I told you that

159
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,862
the left-wing revolutionaries of France at that time

160
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:52,956
were against women's rights too.

161
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:56,979
They implemented the Declaration of the Rights 
of Man and of the Citizen

162
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,920
but women were not given rights.

163
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,659
A Jacobin politician, Chaumette, had said that

164
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:04,373
men have been given duties by nature

165
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:07,974
to hunt, to farm, to become politicians,

166
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,962
but women have been given duties to

167
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,077
take care of the house and of motherhood.

168
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:13,857
He called it 'shameless'

169
00:07:13,857 --> 00:07:15,959
for women to be demanding political rights for themselves.

170
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,052
"Do they want to be a man?"

171
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:20,620
Many women agreed with this opinion at that time.

172
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,443
Even 100 years later,

173
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,585
in London in 1908,

174
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:28,740
there was a woman who formed the 
Women's National Anti-Suffrage League.

175
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,281
Her name was Mary and she told people

176
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:32,750
not to address her by her name,

177
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,686
rather, to address her by her husband's name.

178
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:36,785
Her husband's name was Humphrey Ward.

179
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:39,566
So she called herself Mrs. Humphrey Ward.

180
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:41,500
She was not an illiterate woman.

181
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,211
In fact, she was a best-selling novelist.

182
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:45,078
She was internationally famous.

183
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:48,249
She had promoted women's education in Oxford.

184
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:51,879
But she was staunchly against giving women voting rights.

185
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,262
She believed that only men can

186
00:07:54,262 --> 00:07:59,131
solve constitutional, legal, financial, 
military, and international problems.

187
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:01,145
And then, 70 years later,

188
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:04,788
in 1972, which is literally only 50 years ago,

189
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:07,793
America was about to pass the Equal Rights Amendment

190
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:10,222
to give equal rights to women and men.

191
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:12,551
But there was a woman who opposed it.

192
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:15,278
An American lawyer, Phyllis Schlafly.

193
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:17,348
She mobilised more women

194
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:19,327
to protest against this law.

195
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:23,601
Even now, where many women have 
made history in different fields,

196
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:27,120
women like Kalpana Chawla 
have done space exploration.

197
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,582
Women are becoming scientists,

198
00:08:28,582 --> 00:08:30,252
mathematicians,

199
00:08:30,252 --> 00:08:32,969
some women still hold on to patriarchal thinking.

200
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:35,688
There are women who say that

201
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:37,014
feminism is useless.

202
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:39,078
How can men and women be equal?

203
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:40,904
Their argument is that men 
and women have different anatomies.

204
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:43,232
Men can't give birth to children.

205
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,126
So how can they be equal?

206
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:47,229
"Feminism is baseless,

207
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:49,390
claiming women are equal to men,

208
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,250
there is no need to believe such stuff.

209
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,563
That's my opinion.

210
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:55,366
We are not equal.

211
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:57,058
Only the day men start getting pregnant,

212
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:58,134
will we be equal.

213
00:08:58,134 --> 00:08:59,439
We cannot be equal."

214
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,681
These arguments are very illogical.

215
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:03,508
It is true that in male and female anatomy

216
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:05,124
2-3 organs may differ.

217
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:08,168
But there are at least 70-75 organs

218
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:09,994
that are the same in male and female anatomies.

219
00:09:09,994 --> 00:09:12,211
Two eyes, one nose, two ears,

220
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:14,053
it's the same for men and women.

221
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,181
It is true that their gender is different,

222
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:19,394
but it's not like women belong to a different species.

223
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:21,375
Both are homo sapiens.

224
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,839
And in English, two words are used here,

225
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,411
similar and equal.

226
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:27,477
To get equal rights,

227
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:29,269
you don't have to be equal,

228
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,903
being similar is good enough.

229
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,147
"Nature creates diversity,

230
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:35,215
but it doesn't create discrimination.

231
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:36,675
It creates differences,

232
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:38,247
but it doesn't create discrimination.

233
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:40,381
Nature creates diversity,

234
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:43,721
but not hierarchy, not inequality.

235
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:46,041
The diversity created by nature

236
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:50,748
is transformed into discrimination and inequality by society."

237
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:52,890
Women give birth to children,

238
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,695
so they get maternity leave.

239
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:57,159
But when women work in the office,

240
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,716
they should be paid equally to men.

241
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:01,450
How is there any sort of confusion in this?

242
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,014
Yes, men and women are not totally similar to one another.

243
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:08,519
But a black man and a white man 
are not totally similar to one another.

244
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,525
A man who can walk on his two legs

245
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:12,604
and a man who is sitting in a wheelchair

246
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,393
are not totally similar to each other.

247
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:17,847
There is a difference between a smart man and a stupid man.

248
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:20,409
But equal rights are given to everyone.

249
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:21,964
Because of these differences,

250
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:27,253
it is not said that certain kinds 
of men should not get equal rights. 

251
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:28,586
In every human being,

252
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,327
there are small differences in comparison to other people.

253
00:10:31,327 --> 00:10:32,755
But this does not mean that

254
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:34,575
those who can walk on two legs

255
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:36,060
should be given voting rights

256
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,293
and those who need a wheelchair should not be.

257
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:42,392
These differences cannot be the reason for not giving equal rights.

258
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,733
So, we come back to the same point.

259
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:46,834
The feminist struggle

260
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:49,249
is not a men versus women scenario,

261
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:53,138
rather it is about patriarchal people 
versus feminist people.

262
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:56,197
And this is not just a fight for equal rights for women,

263
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,659
but also a fight for the rights of men.

264
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,115
You heard it right, Men's Rights.

265
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:06,412
Patriarchy is the reason behind many men's issues.

266
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:07,974
It may sound confusing,

267
00:11:07,974 --> 00:11:09,240
but let me explain it with an example.

268
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,009
If I tell you, friends, 'unemployed youth,'

269
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:15,609
imagine a picture of a jobless person in your mind.

270
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,427
What picture did you imagine?

271
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,541
You must have imagined a jobless man.

272
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,878
You must have imagined a jobless boy.

273
00:11:22,878 --> 00:11:23,772
Not a girl.

274
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:26,151
This is because, in our society,

275
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:29,350
we often see that if a girl is jobless,

276
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,101
she can still get married.

277
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:32,834
She can become a housewife.

278
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:35,194
But if a boy is jobless,

279
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,851
that becomes very problematic.

280
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:40,328
The pressure of not being unemployed

281
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:42,926
is much higher for men than for women.

282
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:45,114
The patriarchal ideology says that

283
00:11:45,114 --> 00:11:47,035
women will work at home

284
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:49,462
and men will have to earn money.

285
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:51,926
And if a woman is working and earning,

286
00:11:51,926 --> 00:11:54,287
then the man will have to earn more than her.

287
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:55,655
Otherwise, what will people say?

288
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:58,487
People will accuse him of living off of his girlfriend.

289
00:11:58,487 --> 00:11:59,982
They will criticise him as a man.

290
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:02,864
For being a man who lives off of a woman's money.

291
00:12:02,864 --> 00:12:03,925
That he should be ashamed.

292
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:06,216
Taunting him about his wife who earns more than him.

293
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:07,785
And as I told you earlier,

294
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:11,147
many women and girls are victims of this patriarchal mindset.

295
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,630
Even they say that they want a husband

296
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,941
who earns more than them.

297
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:18,233
They will refuse an arranged marriage

298
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:19,840
if the boy does not earn more than them.

299
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,690
And this same patriarchal mindset

300
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,758
is also present in men's height.

301
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:25,967
Tall women like tall men.

302
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:29,646
But short women also like tall men.

303
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:33,737
If by chance, the wife's height is more than her husband's height,

304
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:37,871
then people criticise the man for being shorter than his wife.

305
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:39,076
They make fun of the couple.

306
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:41,257
They laugh at the man.

307
00:12:41,257 --> 00:12:43,869
All because of the same backward patriarchal thinking.

308
00:12:43,869 --> 00:12:45,191
If you are a man,

309
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:48,444
suppose you are in your car with your wife or girlfriend,

310
00:12:48,444 --> 00:12:52,000
and a car comes and hits your car.

311
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,034
Even though it's his fault, he gets 
out of his car and starts shouting at you.

312
00:12:57,034 --> 00:12:59,625
So what would you do in such a situation?

313
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,121
Most people will get out of their car

314
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:03,950
and start shouting at the other person.

315
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,976
But Gautam Buddha said,

316
00:13:05,976 --> 00:13:08,543
"He gave me abuses, I didn't take them.

317
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:10,437
So the abuses remained with him."

318
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:12,752
If you choose to ignore the negativity someone throws at you,

319
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:14,824
the negativity will remain with them.

320
00:13:14,824 --> 00:13:18,122
Such thinking makes sense 
only to a sensible man.

321
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:20,057
But what does patriarchal thinking say?

322
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:22,328
"If someone insulted you in front of your wife

323
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:23,972
and you just left after hearing it,

324
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:25,512
what kind of a man are you?

325
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:26,885
You should have broken his face.

326
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:28,014
You are a coward,

327
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:29,814
what will your wife think about you?"

328
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:32,234
And because of this patriarchal mindset,

329
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:36,202
society forces that man to engage with the one insulting him

330
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:37,993
and fight with them.

331
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,370
Will fighting solve the problem?

332
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,481
Not at all.

333
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:50,199
Imagine that other driver is like 
Ranvijay from the film Animal.

334
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:52,979
A rich man who doesn't care about the law,

335
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:56,122
he carries a revolver or a baseball bat with him.

336
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:57,624
What will you do then?

337
00:13:57,624 --> 00:14:01,406
Even in frustration, you'll turn around and apologise to him.

338
00:14:01,406 --> 00:14:03,868
Your male ego will be hurt.

339
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,633
People will still make fun of you.

340
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:11,248
As a man who was beaten up.

341
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:12,969
Just for apologising.

342
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:15,722
Many research papers prove that

343
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:19,027
men are more likely to get into fights than women.

344
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:22,648
In 2022, the State of UK Boys report was released which showed

345
00:14:22,648 --> 00:14:25,788
how violence is normalised

346
00:14:25,788 --> 00:14:28,690
and it is believed that when a boy grows up,

347
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,286
violence is a natural part of growing up.

348
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:34,576
But the problem isn't limited to the violence,

349
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:37,147
but also of men's loneliness.

350
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:38,284
Now you must be wondering,

351
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:39,438
how is this possible?

352
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:43,578
How is men's loneliness related to 
feminism and patriarchy?

353
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:46,445
But there is a strong relation, friends.

354
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:49,361
The patriarchal mindset does not allow a man to cry.

355
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:51,607
If a man cries, society mocks him 

356
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:53,782
for being a man who cries.

357
00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:56,200
There's the saying, 'Boys don't cry.'

358
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,643
Forget about crying,

359
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:10,213
patriarchal thinking does not let men 
express any negative emotion.

360
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:16,207
If a boy talks to his male friends 
about his problems and stress,

361
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,771
he is considered emotionally weak.

362
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:22,419
He is told that he is getting emotional like girls.

363
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:26,420
In our society, what are the activities 
to express male friendships?

364
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:30,399
Boys like to watch movies with their male friends,

365
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,752
play cricket or party with each other.

366
00:15:33,752 --> 00:15:38,388
But women's friendships are more intimate and emotional.

367
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:41,142
Girls talk more openly with their friends,

368
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:42,905
express their problems.

369
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:44,769
But if a boy does this,

370
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,862
society will not accept him. 

371
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,992
This is the reason why,

372
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:51,512
men's loneliness becomes a separate issue.

373
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:53,266
When a boy feels depressed,

374
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:57,431
he is forced to hide his depression.

375
00:15:57,431 --> 00:16:02,186
Openly expressing any kind of grief, 
any kind of emotional problem

376
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:04,724
is not considered acceptable in society.

377
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:07,081
"So much emotional castration, friends,

378
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:11,813
that he is deprived of emotional intelligence."

379
00:16:12,745 --> 00:16:14,186
And what does this result in?

380
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:18,064
If you look at global data for people dying by su!cide,

381
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:20,860
then the rate among men is much higher than that of women.

382
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,826
Even in India, according to the government's NCRB data,

383
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:26,243
the rate of su!cide among men

384
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:29,319
is 2.5 times higher than that of women.

385
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:31,812
What is the reason behind these problems?

386
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:34,127
Patriarchal thinking and patriarchy.

387
00:16:34,673 --> 00:16:36,548
That's why when feminists say

388
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:37,853
'Smash the Patriarchy,'

389
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:40,418
it doesn't mean that they are against men.

390
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:42,246
Patriarchy is a way of thinking that

391
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:45,332
is destroying the lives of both men and women.

392
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:47,579
When we talk about feminism in India,

393
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,779
Kamla Bhasin's name comes up a lot.

394
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:52,325
7 years ago, she gave this TEDx talk

395
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:56,800
in which she explained how patriarchy dehumanises men.

396
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,484
"You are not allowed to cry.

397
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,066
Your mother passed away.

398
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,211
But boys are not allowed to cry.

399
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,348
Emotional castration."

400
00:17:03,348 --> 00:17:05,276
If you want to watch this entire TEDx talk,

401
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:07,750
I have put the link in the description below.

Click on it to watch it.

403
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:13,446
Apart from this, these issues have been raised often internationally.

404
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:16,013
Like Cassie Jaye's famous TEDx talk

405
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:17,773
which has more than 10 million views.

406
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:19,940
A Feminist Talking About Men's Rights

407
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:22,748
"There is no denying that there are many

408
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:24,145
human rights issues

409
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:28,131
that uniquely or disproportionately affect men."

410
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,468
Angelica Ferrara from Stanford University

411
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:32,556
wrote the book Men Without Men.

412
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:37,878
This book explains how men's loneliness is a feminist issue.

413
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:42,300
Taking a look at history, we should 
consider Raja Ram Mohan Roy a feminist

414
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,555
because he campaigned against Sati.

415
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:46,579
And Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar

416
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,030
who promoted widow remarriage.

417
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,246
Our social reformers were not against men,

418
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:53,988
but wanted to give equal rights to women.

419
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:56,214
And if we talk about Indian feminists,

420
00:17:56,214 --> 00:17:58,211
how can we forget Savitribai Phule?

421
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,219
India's one of the greatest feminists.

422
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:04,387
She established the first girls' school 
with her friend Fatima Sheikh.

423
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:07,200
She had to bear so much anger from society

424
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,651
that people used to throw cow dung at them.

425
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:13,052
She used to take a spare saree with her to school.

426
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:15,222
Was Savitribai Phule against men?

427
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:17,080
Obviously not.

428
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,135
In fact, it was her husband Jyotirao Phule

429
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:20,561
who taught her.

430
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:23,263
If you want to know more about Savitribai Phule,

431
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:25,498
then this is a great audiobook on KUKU FM.

438
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:44,307
If we talk about history,

439
00:18:44,307 --> 00:18:47,155
feminism is divided into three waves.

440
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:51,465
The first wave of feminism came in the 1800s and early 1900s.

441
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:55,129
This was the time when women demanded to have political rights.

442
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:56,723
Right to vote.

443
00:18:56,723 --> 00:18:59,299
Before this, women did not have the right to vote.

444
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:02,683
In the French Revolution, a political activist, Olympe de Gouges,

445
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,475
drafted a document,

446
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:07,757
the Declaration of the Rights of Women and of the Female Citizen.

447
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:11,671
She is considered one of the first feminists in the world.

448
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:14,348
The second wave of feminism came around the 1960s.

449
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:17,977
This focused on the issue of ending gender discrimination in their households.

450
00:19:17,977 --> 00:19:20,907
During this time, a slogan was raised by the famous feminist Carol Hanisch,

451
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:23,353
The Personal is Political.

452
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:26,748
Many legal and social rights were given to women.

453
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,968
After this, came the third wave of feminism,

454
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,724
which started in the 1990s.

455
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:33,581
This focused on the issues of intersectional feminism.

456
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:37,391
That is, feminism is not only for upper-class white women,

457
00:19:37,391 --> 00:19:40,742
rather poor and black women should get the same rights.

458
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:42,326
But do you know what the problem is?

459
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:45,074
The boys who present themselves as alpha males on social media,

460
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:49,348
they will not talk about any of these 
issues while talking about feminism.

461
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:51,326
They will make fun of feminism

462
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:53,038
by using these films.

463
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,380
Wherever you see, these films are compared to feminism.

464
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,398
As if feminism means nothing else, but these films.

465
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,387
When I made a video on the film Animal,

466
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:06,430
some people asked why critics always 
criticise films like Animal and Kabir Singh.

467
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:09,273
Why aren't such films criticised?

468
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:13,963
But if you look at the critics' reviews of these films, 

469
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,551
I named two film critics in the Animal video.

470
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:19,075
Anupama Chopra and Sucharita Tyagi.

471
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:22,147
I saw Anupama Chopra's review of Four More Shorts.

472
00:20:22,147 --> 00:20:24,769
She said this for the first two seasons of the show.

473
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:30,039
"I never made it past episode 2 of Season 1 of Four More Shots, Please."

474
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:33,129
In her review written on her portal Film Companion,

475
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:37,653
she said that this show shows a superficial form of feminism.

476
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,937
That it's a poorly written TV show.

477
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:42,800
What did Sucharita have to say about Thank You For Coming?

478
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,823
That this is a largely unwatchable film.

479
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,391
"Thank You For Coming is a film

480
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:48,564
only masquerading as a feminist romp.

481
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:50,565
While mostly being a masculine gaze

482
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:53,077
on how women probably, maybe, live their lives.

483
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:56,280
That though the films pretends to be a feminist romp,

484
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,251
it is presented from a masculine gaze.

485
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:01,555
A person who understands feminism properly,

486
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:03,172
for them it is obvious that

487
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:06,309
these films have nothing to do with feminism.

488
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:11,607
It's true that film producers force words like Feminism in more and more films,

489
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:14,980
but what is portrayed in the films, has nothing to do with Feminism.

490
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,963
Feminism doesn't mean that women

491
00:21:16,963 --> 00:21:21,931
go out and smoke, drink, or objectify men.

492
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:23,145
This is not feminism.

493
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:25,109
Actually, the real feminist films

494
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:26,676
there's no dearth of them in Bollywood.

495
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:28,579
The only difference is that

496
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,153
the alpha men on social media

497
00:21:31,153 --> 00:21:33,848
don't relate feminism to those films.

498
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:35,184
Like this film Pink.

499
00:21:35,184 --> 00:21:36,756
This is a real feminist film.

500
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:38,458
It clearly shows that

501
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,920
drinking doesn't equate to women empowerment.

502
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,533
But the problem is that

503
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:45,013
when a man drinks alcohol, it affects his liver.

504
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,837
But when a woman drinks alcohol,

505
00:21:46,837 --> 00:21:49,241
it becomes a character certificate for her.

506
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,957
Other than this, there are films like The Great Indian Kitchen,

507
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:54,407
Tumhari Sulu, Queen, English Vinglish,

508
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:56,546
Dor, Mirch Masala.

509
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:58,639
These people will never talk about such films.

510
00:21:58,639 --> 00:22:00,147
Then there are films like Thappad.

511
00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:04,038
Many alpha males criticised this film saying that

512
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:06,342
the wife got a divorce just because of a slap,

513
00:22:06,342 --> 00:22:07,704
they said that this is not realistic.

514
00:22:07,704 --> 00:22:09,109
This can't be real.

515
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:10,157
And no one should do this. 

516
00:22:10,157 --> 00:22:13,061
But think about it, if the story was reversed.

517
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:17,372
At a party, had a wife slapped her husband in front of everyone.

518
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:20,260
The same people would say that it is grounds for divorce.

519
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,869
The man should divorce her because of it.

520
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:24,749
Then there is a very popular meme of Neha Dhupia.

521
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:26,592
In an episode of Roadies,

522
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:29,097
when she said that it's her choice

523
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,575
"It's her choice.

524
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:31,627
-Of course.
-Yeah?

525
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:34,972
Nobody gives you the right to slap a girl!"

526
00:22:34,972 --> 00:22:37,552
When the boy did something wrong, he was criticised,

527
00:22:37,552 --> 00:22:40,370
But in another episode, when the girl did the same thing,

528
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,691
Neha justified it and said that

529
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:43,921
it's her choice.

530
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:46,161
Neha was criticised a lot for this

531
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:47,412
and she was mocked.

532
00:22:47,412 --> 00:22:48,645
And it's obvious that

533
00:22:48,645 --> 00:22:51,300
what she said was a very hypocritical.

534
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,383
But you know what?

535
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:55,751
Most of the alpha male incels on Instagram,

536
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,446
show the same hypocrisy.

537
00:22:57,446 --> 00:23:00,330
You must have seen many of these guys showing off that

538
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,058
they have girls in Delhi, one in Mumbai, and one in Punjab.

539
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:06,048
And then they use memes like,

540
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:08,056
Boys will be boys, men will be men.

541
00:23:08,056 --> 00:23:10,650
But if the girl cheats on them,

542
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,356
then they can't tolerate it.

543
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:14,101
It becomes too much for them to bear.

544
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,981
That becomes toxic feminism.

545
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:18,651
But on the other hand, boys will be boys.

546
00:23:18,651 --> 00:23:20,447
When boys are in the wrong, boys will be boys.

547
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:22,739
You can see hypocrisy on both sides.

548
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:23,940
And both sides are wrong.

549
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,383
But did any feminist ever say that

550
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:28,368
what Neha Dhupia said was right?

551
00:23:28,368 --> 00:23:29,558
No one said that.

552
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:31,481
But again and again, feminism

553
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:34,057
is tried to be equated to that statement.

554
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:36,973
It is related to wrong things.

555
00:23:36,973 --> 00:23:40,816
There was a case in Lucknow 
where a girl misbehaved with a boy

556
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:42,443
and beat him up repeatedly.

557
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:45,511
It was found that the girl apparently was from a rich family

558
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:46,643
and the boy belonged to a poor family.

559
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:48,707
What happened was entirely wrong.

560
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:50,396
It is not right to beat anyone.

561
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:54,482
But did any feminist show their support for this girl?

562
00:23:54,482 --> 00:23:55,657
No one did.

563
00:23:55,657 --> 00:23:58,555
But still, what is shown on social media repeatedly

564
00:23:58,555 --> 00:24:00,893
is that this is feminism.

565
00:24:00,893 --> 00:24:06,590
Why do incels relate feminism to these problematic issues?

566
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,383
And never talks about real feminism?

567
00:24:09,383 --> 00:24:10,727
The reason is very simple.

568
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:13,615
They don't want equal rights for men and women.

569
00:24:13,615 --> 00:24:16,891
They want to promote the same patriarchal mindset

570
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:20,822
and want to discredit the entire feminist movement.

571
00:24:20,822 --> 00:24:24,450
These people spread lies that feminists hate all men.

572
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,633
That feminists want women to leave men forever.

573
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:32,109
But the real feminism that I talked about in the first half of this video,

574
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:33,857
will never be discussed.

575
00:24:33,857 --> 00:24:36,577
So, friends, I hope this video helped you understand

576
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:38,389
the real meaning of feminism

577
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:42,615
and why Smash Patriarchy is important for boys and men.

578
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:43,970
Because we want to see a world where

579
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,803
men and women have equal rights to be free,

580
00:24:48,803 --> 00:24:50,850
in terms of equal rights and opportunities.

581
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,977
A society where

582
00:24:51,977 --> 00:24:55,646
men are not pressurised into suppressing their emotions.

583
00:24:55,646 --> 00:24:59,665
Now if you want to understand the ideology of equality in details,

584
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:03,772
how the ideas of liberty and equality were born historically,

585
00:25:03,772 --> 00:25:06,182
how these ideas spread all over the world,

586
00:25:06,182 --> 00:25:08,869
I have talked it in this video,

587
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:11,645
in which I have explained the French Revolution in detail.

588
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:13,496

589
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:14,945
Thank you very much!
