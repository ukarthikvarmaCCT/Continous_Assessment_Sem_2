1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,647
Normally, we don't attend many events, but

2
00:00:03,647 --> 00:00:06,209
today would be the first time we'll be attending an event

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:08,359
with many YouTubers and creators.

4
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,751
It would be quite exciting to see.

5
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:10,911
This is the Nas Summit.

6
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,062
This is why we're back in Dubai.

7
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:17,172
This is the largest gathering of international content creators

8
00:00:17,172 --> 00:00:18,842
in the last 2 years!

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,995
This time, our hotel is quite close to the metro station,

10
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:27,666
so we'll take the metro for the first time

11
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,135
and see how Dubai's metro is.

12
00:00:32,793 --> 00:00:34,630
Who actually cycles here?

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,783
There're so many cycles.

14
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:36,723
Look at that.

15
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:39,018
Emirates Tower.

16
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:58,378
There's even a gold class on this train.

17
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:00,086
 -Book it!
-Oh, you did not book it?

18
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:03,925
-It's weird.
-Oh, true.

19
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:20,413
So overall, this metro is quite similar to Delhi metro.

20
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:22,815
So many things are the same.

21
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:27,784
The visuals that you can see from the train.

22
00:01:28,195 --> 00:01:29,871
-What happened?
-Keep going.

23
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,493
I shouldn't be filming in such crowded places.

24
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,763
It attracts too much attention.

25
00:01:42,195 --> 00:01:44,811
-I'll be filming today, okay?
-Great.

26
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:49,049
We found Mohit and Sandhya on the way.

27
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,345
-Hi!
-Hi!

28
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:03,239
Oh wow, this is the hall where everyone will sit.

29
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,516
I was wondering, in a hotel, how is there a place for 700 people.

30
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:19,028
It is more crowded than I expected it to be.

31
00:02:19,028 --> 00:02:20,529
There are so many creators.

32
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:22,421
And several people actually recognise us.

33
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:24,391
-Snacks, snacks.
-Snacks?

34
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:25,659
-Yeah.
-Okay.

35
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:26,667
Food, food.

36
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:33,488
We have no idea about what's going on here.

37
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:36,387
Who are the ones getting such an energetic welcome?

38
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:40,475
"Okay so, my name is Matt and this is Belik."

39
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,876
"The game we're playing, apply for a visa, in some cases,

40
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:53,609
find a hotel, and come here,

41
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:55,970
to learn with other people that are just like you.

42
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,099
Thank you for coming here."

43
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:01,200
It sounds like an Apple presentation.

44
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:04,579
"...you'll see in India..."

45
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:08,078
Greenland's biggest YouTuber is also here.

46
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:10,588
"...And she won the Biggest Creator in Greenland,

47
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:12,384
with ten thousand followers,

48
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:13,667
do you know why?

49
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,819
because fifty thousand people live in Greenland..."

50
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:20,328
That's 20% of the country.

51
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:23,493
Do you know the World's Biggest Fish YouTuber?

52
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:25,296
Yeah, if it is Graham Stepan, I know.

53
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:39,196
It's Casey Neistat.

54
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:49,588
"40-year old, married guy, with 2 babies at home.

55
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:53,056
That's what my life is right now."

56
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:57,611
There's also a pool party in this hotel.

57
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:59,692
And it is a special hotel because

58
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:02,339
it gets a truly amazing view of Burj Khalifa.

59
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:11,688
So we met Ranveer Allahbadia aka Beer Biceps.

60
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:15,359
-He's really hyper today.
-Is this the vlog?

61
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:18,944
This is a video now for our vlog,

62
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:20,704
because we haven't been filming a lot,

63
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:21,745
so I was thinking.

64
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:24,027
So how is it going?
Are you having fun?

65
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:25,648
I'm tripping out,

66
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:28,937
This is how Juli's puts her voice in the vlog and all that, it's crazy.

67
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:30,009
Love it.

68
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:32,190
Okay, I'm telling you he's so hyper.

69
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,881
Look at this, what am I supposed to think about this?

70
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:40,123
There's some serious bromance going on.

71
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:41,435
Everything you've seen on Beer Biceps' vlogs,

72
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:44,049
-he's even more hyper in real life.
-Yeah.

73
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:49,701
Because Dhruv's sexiness is 100 times more in real life.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,945
He is quite sexy online,

75
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:54,398
but he is even sexier in real life.

76
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:57,245
I'm just expressing my man crush.

77
00:04:57,533 --> 00:05:00,387
I mean, I don't disagree, it's just...

78
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:02,683
Another interesting thing,

79
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:05,585
normally the fans that I come across are from India,

80
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:09,891
but here I met a viewer from Myanmar. 

81
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:12,945
I'm interested in the topic that you are saying, like geopolitics, 

82
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:16,681
and since I'm interested in that topic,

83
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:18,715
I just know the topic that you are saying,

84
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:19,904
but I don't understand you.

85
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,986
-So I have been following you.
-Yeah, yeah, but you can use subtitles.

86
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:23,607
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, very interesting.

87
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:32,837
Today is the second day of the Summit.

88
00:05:32,837 --> 00:05:34,300
The last day for us,

89
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,364
we aren't staying long.

90
00:05:35,364 --> 00:05:36,436
We have a flight tomorrow.

91
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,484
I have a presentation today.

92
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:42,872
Well not a presentation really, I'll be on the stage to speak for a bit.

93
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:45,292
It's a panel discussion.

94
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:46,615
Not a presentation.

95
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:49,001
"...I swear that was such a brain fog..."

96
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,791
I'm backstage before the panel discussion,

97
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,468
Technical Guruji and Carryminati are already here.

98
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:57,268
And you can see Mostly Sane here.

99
00:06:00,634 --> 00:06:01,666
"Let's begin."

100
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:04,760
Vlog section.

101
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,519
"Make sure you turn your phone towards the people the viewers want to watch.

102
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,747
The video would turn out great,

103
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:11,113
I have some really good people with me,

104
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:14,152
and the event is running 15-minutes late,

105
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:15,635
but a backstage video is important

106
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:18,628
so let's talk for a while.

107
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:19,887
How are you feeling in Dubai?

108
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:23,054
It's great, it's fun, so many things are happening all around,

109
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:24,794
I'm not sure what's happening,

110
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:26,131
but it was fun, it was awesome,

111
00:06:26,131 --> 00:06:27,405
let's see what happens right now.

112
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:29,320
Did he know this question was coming?

113
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,494
No, he didn't.

114
00:06:30,494 --> 00:06:33,907
Everyone on my vlog has to speak fast, let's go Dhruv.

115
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:34,967
What should I say?

116
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,628
-Today, tell us something about Dubai.
-But you have to speak fast.

117
00:06:38,628 --> 00:06:40,786
I have explored Dubai for a while,

118
00:06:40,786 --> 00:06:42,548
No, wait, wait, wait,

119
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:43,885
faster, faster.

120
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:45,562
-With hands.
-You have to speak fast.

121
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:50,068
Actually, I'll tell you a secret, I speak very slowly.

122
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:52,216
And I speed up the videos later.

123
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:53,227
-Really?
-Yeah.

124
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:56,217
I'm the opposite, people have to slow down my video to watch it. 

125
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:59,887
This is Technical Guruji's phone.

126
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:05,404
This phone deserves an unboxing video.

127
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:07,814
What's on here?

128
00:07:07,814 --> 00:07:10,439
The theme here is Space,

129
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,152
These pieces, 1...2...3... These 6 pieces here,

130
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:16,408
these are pieces of meteorites from Mars and the Moon. 

131
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:18,171
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

132
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:21,215
And the theme is space, you can see the rings of a planet.

133
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:23,355
Plus, there's a quote by Albert Einstein here.

134
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:25,737
-This is a watch that runs.
-Wow.

135
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,769
For example, it's 2:50 now.

136
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:29,380
It's 2:50 here.

137
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,730
And then here's my logo,

138
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,892
this is all titanium,

139
00:07:32,892 --> 00:07:34,415
this is my name here,

140
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:36,171
this is the only one in the world.

141
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,094
-This is all solid gold.
-You designed all of this?

142
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:40,987
No, it was by the company that made it, Caviar.

143
00:07:40,987 --> 00:07:42,670
Oh, wow.

144
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,327
This is solid gold?

145
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:45,731
Yeah, that's why it's so heavy.

146
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,399
-Hi.
-So you're gonna have your panel discussion 

147
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,111
Are you nervous at all?

148
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:52,081
Because I'm nervous on your behalf.

149
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:58,683
No, it's not a very complex topic or something.

150
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:01,626
But it's been a long time since I've been on a stage.

151
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:05,644
The last time was with Kunal Kamra in 2019?

152
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:06,844
In Amsterdam?

153
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:07,949
Amsterdam, yeah.

154
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:14,030
Since it's been a long time I'm getting some stage fright.

155
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,941
It's easier to speak in a video.

156
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:19,526
But to speak on a stage is tougher in comparison.

157
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:22,748
This was a small backroom.

158
00:08:22,748 --> 00:08:24,952
Like they show in films,

159
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:26,405
a place for actors to get ready.

160
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,673
We had gathered here,

161
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,868
and then this is the way to the backstage.

162
00:08:29,868 --> 00:08:31,491
-All the best!
-Thank you.

163
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,854
That looks like the backstage.

164
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:41,498
I'll be going up on a stage after a long time.

165
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:53,359
Guess who's coming on the panel now.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,116
There he is!

167
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:08,798
Hi, guys, my name is Dhruv Rathee,

168
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,609
and I make explanatory videos on a variety of topics,

169
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:15,102
and I have around 7 million subscribers.

170
00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:19,486
Things change like that!

171
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:21,049
In 2 days, the world will change.

172
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:23,502
I will say that probably the only thing you can say for sure,

173
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:27,615
is that more and more people are going to come on the internet right now.

174
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:29,606
So if it's only 50% of the Indian population,

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,616
soon you will see 60%-70%.

176
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:34,669
Once more people come, then

177
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:37,578
you will see that there are different markets within India also

178
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,151
based on the language they speak.

179
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,708
Welcome to the Second Day of the Nas Summit!

180
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:47,203
Okay, again.

181
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:52,044
Welcome to the Second Day of the Nas Summit!

182
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:55,485
I hate making videos.

183
00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:57,738
1, 2, 3!

184
00:09:57,738 --> 00:10:01,689
Welcome to the Second Day of the Nas Summit!

185
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:04,142
Perfect! Okay, cut.

186
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:06,315
Thank you so much for the amazing... 

187
00:10:10,774 --> 00:10:13,788
There we go, Ranveer all ready.

188
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:16,288
Clinging to Dhruv again.

189
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,974
He's stealing my husband.

190
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:20,032
Your love is back!

191
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:21,779
Group hug, group hug, group hug!

192
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:24,495
Look at the amount of cameras here.

193
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,706
How dare Ranveer steal my husband?

194
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,934
Today is the last day of the Summit.

195
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:41,791
But unfortunately, we won't be attending.

196
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,909
Because we have a morning flight.

197
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,733
Even the passport checking is so futuristic here,

198
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:50,034
you just need to scan there, and it automatically recognises your face.

199
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:52,036
You don't need to do anything else.

200
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:54,593
Where do you think we're going?

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,317
See if you can guess.

202
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:16,680
Welcome to Delhi.

203
00:11:16,947 --> 00:11:18,645
Welcome to India.
