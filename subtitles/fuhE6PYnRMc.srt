1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,007
- I just bought this train

2
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:03,450
and it is currently barreling full-speed

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,190
towards that giant pit over there.

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,080
We're also crashing countless cars,

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,570
blowing up thousands of
sticks of real dynamite,

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,150
and even putting 10 jet engines on a car.

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,240
Just to show you the most
insane experiments of all time.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,710
Starting with filling a house
with over 100,000 fireworks.

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,900
Please do not try this in your house.

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,980
For this experiment,

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,260
each of the boys will hide
a dummy in my new house

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,510
to see if it's even possible to survive.

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,770
- Water and fire don't mix,

14
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,210
my mannequin is going to survive.

15
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,220
- Mine's in the fridge.

16
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,060
- Go in, come on.

17
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,350
Let's blow this house up.

18
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,250
Hey be careful.

19
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,980
If you accidentally press
one, the house explodes.

20
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,210
- Oh my goodness.
- Please.

21
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,043
Where's your mannequin?

22
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:41,220
- Bathtub.
- Fridge.

23
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,360
- Under the washer.

24
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,490
- Tareq?
- Front porch.

25
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,530
- Oh yeah, it's sitting right there.

26
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,090
This is gonna be the coolest thing

27
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,552
you have ever seen in your life!

28
00:00:49,552 --> 00:00:51,802
- Yes! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

29
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:56,321
- Fire in the hole!

30
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,308
- Oh my God!

31
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:05,107
- What happened to the house?

32
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,507
I can't even see it anymore.

33
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,234
- Oh my god!

34
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:19,067
- I don't think our mannequins

35
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:20,460
are gonna make it.

36
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,630
- The house burned all night,

37
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,880
until there was literally nothing left,

38
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,620
including all the mannequins.

39
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,990
Next experiment.

40
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,220
We're about to play Tug-of-War

41
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,080
between this real military tank

42
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,580
and these two school buses.

43
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,500
And the loser gets dragged into the pit.

44
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,060
- There's no way the tank loses.

45
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,080
- We're probably gonna lose.

46
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,913
- No, we're not.

47
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:39,720
- Now obviously, people
can't be in these vehicles,

48
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,640
'cause they'll die when
they fall in the pit.

49
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,670
So this remote actually controls the tank.

50
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,798
This feels illegal.

51
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:46,798
3, 2, 1. Go!

52
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:52,331
- I'm full throttled right now.

53
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:53,303
You're done for!

54
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:56,610
Oh!
- Oh, we're screwed.

55
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,944
- The buses are done for.

56
00:01:57,944 --> 00:02:01,686
Oh my god.

57
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:03,104
- Oh my god!

58
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:16,280
- Oh my god!

59
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,037
- Do you hear the buses beeping?

60
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,410
Its horn's going off.

61
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,867
- We're gonna go investigate
the bottom of the pit

62
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:22,470
to see the buses.

63
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,850
- Oh god.
- Oh, no.

64
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,290
I need to stop looking down this is...

65
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,780
Stop moving!
- I'm not moving!

66
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,620
- We're in the pit.

67
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,540
Oh my gosh. Bro, look at that.

68
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,413
Why'd the bus think it
could beat the tank?

69
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:33,360
- I don't think it did.

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,410
- Later in this video,

71
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,360
a train's gonna come off those tracks

72
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,920
and land right about there.

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,250
But before we do that, this is $50,000,

74
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,550
and it is surrounded by
thousands of pounds of TNT.

75
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,080
And this is Will.

76
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,913
- What's up guys?

77
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:48,388
- See that crate in the field?
- Yeah.

78
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,490
Oh, man.

79
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,620
- That is around 1% of the explosives

80
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,610
surrounding this money.

81
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,690
- Are we safe standing here?

82
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,430
- Uh yeah, you'll be fine.

83
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,540
Here's my credit card.

84
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,510
Spend as much money as you
want to protect this 50 grand.

85
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,310
I don't care if you use wood, bricks,

86
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,200
or even steel to protect this money.

87
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,850
Whatever's left of this 50 grand

88
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,890
when that TNT blows up, you keep.

89
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,790
Good luck building walls.

90
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,980
- All right, let's make $50,000!

91
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,690
- I don't think he stands a chance.

92
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,950
The first thing Will did

93
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,470
was buy 12 industrial water containers

94
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,693
and filled them with
20,000 pounds of water.

95
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,990
- I'm really worried that Jimmy's TNT

96
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,980
is gonna get through this.

97
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,850
- And he should be,

98
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,180
because this isn't even close
to enough to stop the TNT.

99
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,520
Meanwhile, we're gonna
test another experiment.

100
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,130
In a previous video, we
put a jet engine on a car

101
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,990
and it jumped eight buses.

102
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,600
So this time we put 10
jet engines on the car

103
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,807
and we're to see if it
flies 10 times further.

104
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,190
When this car flies off this ramp,

105
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,890
I think it's gonna go past
all the buses into the trees.

106
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,150
- I think it's gonna hit the first bus.

107
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,040
- Our guesses couldn't be further apart.

108
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,620
He's currently matrix-ed into the car,

109
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,240
so he sees what the car sees.

110
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,830
Chris!
- Hey!

111
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,790
- Oh, should we move?

112
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,685
- Yeah, we're sending a rocket car.

113
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:56,518
- Oh, okay.

114
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:57,351
- 3, 2, 1.

115
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,544
Send the jet car!

116
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,430
The car's coming straight at us.

117
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,470
- I lost signal.

118
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,430
- Maybe we should jump?

119
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,073
- Now I'm straightening it.

120
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:19,565
- Oh, my god!

121
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,250
Yeah!
- What the heck?

122
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,120
- Whoa! Wait, wait.

123
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,420
We broke the ramp!

124
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,010
- I think it was a success.
- Yes.

125
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,650
The jet car easily cleared all 12 buses

126
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,140
and literally left a crater in the road.

127
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,700
I love how this block of engine's

128
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,660
just on the road.

129
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,988
- Yeah, it's still smoking.

130
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:38,821
Whoa!

131
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:40,120
- Oh, it's leaking.
- Oh, and it's smoking.

132
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,290
- And now we're back at the giant pit.

133
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,820
If you jump in this deep pit

134
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,770
and land on a thousand bouncy balls,

135
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,603
would you die?

136
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:49,110
- I'd love to know. Nolan, catch!

137
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,340
- Catch what? What are we doing?

138
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,173
- Goodbye.

139
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,440
Oh!

140
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,273
Oh.

141
00:04:56,273 --> 00:04:57,300
- You completely missed!

142
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,620
- Luckily we have more mannequins.

143
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,730
Will it survive?

144
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,753
Pay attention!

145
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:05,164
- Oh. Oh!

146
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,440
- Oh, buckets!

147
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,273
- Hey Jimmy!

148
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:09,750
What if we dropped the car in it?

149
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,513
- I think you know what's about to happen.

150
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:19,585
- Yo!

151
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,960
- Clearly that mannequin didn't survive.

152
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,793
Next bit.

153
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,690
Meanwhile, Will was desperately trying

154
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,670
to protect his $50,000.

155
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,770
He's honestly taken
this way more seriously

156
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,640
than I thought he would.

157
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,920
- In the past four days,
I've hired some professionals

158
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,840
and we've already built
the cinder block wall,

159
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,860
filled it with matches,

160
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,840
and we're already on our
second cinder block wall.

161
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,670
This dynamite is not getting through.

162
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,920
- You blew my expectations
outta the water.

163
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,753
How about this?

164
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:47,130
If you let me double the
TNT, I'll double the money.

165
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,110
- So a hundred grand, double the TNT.

166
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,765
- Yeah, but if it blows
it up, you get nothing.

167
00:05:50,765 --> 00:05:53,190
- Take the deal! Take the deal!

168
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:56,010
- Okay! Okay!
- It's a deal baby! Deal baby!

169
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,560
- And while he kept working,
the boys and I went bowling.

170
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,690
And the bowling balls are these cars.

171
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,040
- I'm ready to see some destruction.

172
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,543
- Let's see if I get a strike.

173
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,010
Hey, first bowl a strike.

174
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,540
Oh, it's not going straight.

175
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,938
- Oh, it's coming in our direction.

176
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,980
We should move. We should move.

177
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,564
We should move.
- Nolan, watch out!

178
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:17,940
- Oh, into the field. There it goes.

179
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,960
Oh it's turning around.

180
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,830
- Oh, it's coming back!

181
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,790
- Oh God.
- It's coming back.

182
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,290
The car's got a mind of it's own!

183
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,490
- It's coming back!

184
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,573
- Take number two.

185
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,560
Oh, that's a perfect strike.

186
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:31,649
- Whoa!

187
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,290
- Whoa!
- Let's go!

188
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,790
- I love cars hitting things!

189
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,720
- And if you're wondering,

190
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,430
the other car is still going in circles.

191
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,630
During this bit, me and the boys

192
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,400
have been wearing some brand new designs,

193
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,930
which you can now buy on our new store,

194
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,310
MrBeast.store.

195
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,143
3, 2, 1.

196
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,400
We switched from ShopMrBeast.com,
which was very long-

197
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,620
- Move over! Move over!

198
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,969
- to MrBeast.store.

199
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:54,181
Oh, my gosh!

200
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,900
- Ooh!
- No way!

201
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,733
- Whoa!

202
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,140
- We just about died.

203
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,301
- I'm gonna show you how to
just hit a full strike easily.

204
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:01,134
- Okay.

205
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:02,548
- All right. Here comes a strike, baby.

206
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,590
- A .store domain is the perfect choice

207
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,780
for anyone looking to
sell anything online.

208
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,330
- That was the worst throw yet.

209
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,248
- That was the best throw yet!

210
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:13,081
- That was awesome!

211
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:14,723
- If you're looking to set up a store,

212
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:16,440
it should be at .store domain,

213
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,500
so your customers clearly know
that your website is a store.

214
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,340
- This is Carl's car.

215
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,160
- Unlike .com, MrBeast.store
tells the world

216
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,783
that the website is my store.

217
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,913
Oh.

218
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:30,600
Don't forget to head to MrBeast.store

219
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,850
and buy our brand new merch, right now.

220
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,370
Since I doubled Will's money and TNT,

221
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,680
he's completed a seven-layer fortress

222
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,130
of 20,000 pounds of water, mattresses,

223
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,980
a cinder block wall, four mattresses,

224
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,810
a second cinder block wall,

225
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,110
an additional 32,000 pounds of water,

226
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,930
all packed in with a final wall of dirt.

227
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,160
- But I actually have another layer

228
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,480
that Jimmy knows nothing about.

229
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,870
Jimmy will never see this one coming.

230
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,950
- What?

231
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,570
- Hey, Jimmy!

232
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,580
- How am I supposed to blow up Feastables?

233
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,660
- That's the point.

234
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,980
- And with the TNT doubled,

235
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,170
it's time to put Will's
bunker to the test.

236
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,660
I also brought number 40,
from 1 throughout 100, back

237
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,520
to help us blow up all this TNT.

238
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,630
You're in charge of the button.

239
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,479
Don't press anything yet.

240
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,634
Oh god.

241
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:16,467
Moment of truth.

242
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:19,050
Whenever you're ready, press the one.

243
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,874
I'm nervous.

244
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:24,143
Whoa!

245
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,310
- Oh my god!

246
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,246
- Oh, that money's gone for sure.

247
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,743
- Oh my god!

248
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:38,250
- Bro, look at that smoke cloud!

249
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,350
- I can't even see anything. Is it okay?

250
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,468
- Wait, I think I see
money falling from the sky.

251
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:43,301
- No!

252
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:45,480
Seven days of work just went up in flames.

253
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,100
I don't know if I've got this.

254
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,170
I gotta see if my money's okay!

255
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,130
- Why are we running?

256
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,734
- I'm running 'cause he's running.

257
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,570
- Oh my goodness!

258
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,830
Oh, there's so many stacks!

259
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,790
- We counted out the money

260
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,619
and over $95,000 survived the explosion.

261
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:01,797
- I just won $95,000!

262
00:09:01,797 --> 00:09:03,330
- Congrats on the 95 grand.

263
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,420
Let's go see what happens if
you drive a train into a pit!

264
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,623
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

265
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,950
- And now's the moment
you've all been waiting for,

266
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,710
a train is gonna go
full-speed down those tracks

267
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,090
into this giant pit.

268
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,130
If you were on this train,
where would you sit?

269
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,360
- I put my mannequin in the cabin.

270
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,160
Statistically the safest
place to be on a train.

271
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,889
- All right, you got this.

272
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,777
- All right, we're gonna
sit him right on the front.

273
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,393
You're not going anywhere.

274
00:09:26,393 --> 00:09:28,560
- We're gonna give the
Feastables bar a front row seat.

275
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,420
Stop eating Hershey's. Eat Feastables.

276
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,550
We have waited our entire
lives for this moment.

277
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,817
This is going to be epic.

278
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:35,517
Nolan, send the train!

279
00:09:35,517 --> 00:09:37,020
- The train's coming!

280
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,859
Let's do this!

281
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,630
- Oh my god. Here it goes!

282
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:51,776
- Oh my god, here it comes!

283
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:57,851
- Oh, my god!

284
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:09,931
- Whoa! Look at that!

285
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,140
That might have been the coolest thing

286
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,235
I've ever seen in my life.

287
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:18,720
- Are you kidding me?

288
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,010
- Yeah, my mannequin didn't survive.

289
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,900
- Train versus pit, the pit won.

290
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,280
I hope you enjoyed the video.

291
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,830
Let's end it with an explosion.

292
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,147
- Ooh!

293
00:10:28,147 --> 00:10:29,357
That is so hot!
