00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,458
guys, this is our third episode.

2
00:00:01,458 --> 00:00:06,493
For unboxing the merchandise of your favorite
youtubers sold by them.

3
00:00:06,493 --> 00:00:07,356
Here, i have the overlays box.

4
00:00:07,356 --> 00:00:08,090
Since, I started unboxing on this channel.

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,490
many people commented things like these:

6
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,889
i speak in tech burner's style.

7
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,400
i talk like a tech burner.

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,780
Don't copy tech burner.

9
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,290
And one person keeps commenting on each video:

10
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,710
Tech burner's of men fashion.

11
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:26,230
but on a true note, your any comment does
not hurt me.

12
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,140
bcoz, if you attach gangadhar with truth

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,770
then it will become shaktiman only.

14
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,770
it's a compliment!

15
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,140
in the box of overlays, you will get its brand
name on the top.

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,140
thier logo!

17
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,140
with the website name!

18
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,140
www.

19
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,140
overlaysclothing.com

20
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,140
here its written: Unbox the desire.

21
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,140
nothing else.

22
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,140
The box is made of cardboard.

23
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,820
looks like a very sustainable material.

24
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,780
afterwards, you can use at is as a gift wrap
for your relatives.

25
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,640
After you open the box, you get to see burnt
hakka noodles.

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,190
a card from team overlays and the rest you
can read over here.

27
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,590
you get a tag of overlays on the t-shirt with
a piece of paper that is cut and stuck on

28
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,590
it.

29
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,940
the colour of the t-shirt is white with no
design, its a solid t-shirt.

30
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:08,300
now, lets talk about the fabric because this
is the only thing that makes this t-shirt

31
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,300
unique.

32
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,320
the fabric is cotton and is known as waffled-
textured cotton.

33
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,190
this means that the entire body of the t-shirt
is made like waffles.

34
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,980
if you have eaten a waffle or not, it looks
like this:

35
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,650
the pattern is like this:

36
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,270
similarly, the pattern is made.

37
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,060
The first thing is, that it is very breathable.

38
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,940
literally, if you look like this, you have
got many see-through holes.

39
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,020
this makes a lot of air to come in and makes
you comfortable.

40
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,909
you can use it as a channi for karwachauth
also when your spouse dont get a channi!

41
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:38,780
your karwachauth will be complete!

42
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,770
this t-shirt is very stretchable bringing
squeeziness inside your body.

43
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,680
the cloth grabs your body.

44
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,310
out of hundred things, the cloth looks definitely
premium.

45
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,620
looking down you get a patch of brand overlays.

46
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,570
i found 2 to 3 things missing in this t-shirt,
which i will tell you later on.

47
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,680
talking about the look, it is white suits
for very occassion, time and season.

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
just looks perfect!

49
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,100
so here we have the next tshirt!

50
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,310
if you remember, overlay's first launch!

51
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,310
in that overlays,

52
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,310
hypily the word "supima cotton usage'" was
used.

53
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,390
world's finest cotton was being used.

54
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,560
so continuing that thing, these fabrics are
also designed in the same way.

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
that waffle one was not the supima cotton.

56
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,030
first of all, if you purchase this t-shirt,
the first thing you will feel is the weight

57
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,030
of this t-shirt.

58
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,740
compared to other t-shirts which you shop
around from other brands..

59
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,250
the t shirt is very heavy and the thickness
of

60
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,150
and the quaity of the cloth is very nice.

61
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,190
the same tag is present over here.

62
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,390
The name of the t-shirt is a variant white
and black oversized t-shirt.

63
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,040
the price written over here is 1699, which
means 1700 is the mrp.

64
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,590
it is sold nearby to thousand rupees.

65
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,430
it is also a full white t shirt in the front.

66
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,560
but the designing in the corners and at the
neck area is made of black.

67
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,819
which is a stripped design.

68
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,220
but can you tell whom you remember by looking
at this t-shirt?

69
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,220
ben-ten!!!

70
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,800
the only thing is the middle design is shifted
to the corner design.

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,150
overall it looks like a ben-ten t-shirt only.

72
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,400
down, you get the branding of overlays which
is attached through a rubber patch.

73
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,910
in the neck area, you get one more overlays
tag attached with L size written.

74
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,910
sings song..

75
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,140
talking about the t- shirt, one thing that
increases the level of experience is...

76
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,630
the fabric of the t-shirt is thick and is
very dense.

77
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,920
in this t-shirt, 230 is used.

78
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,240
if you dont know what is this?

79
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,770
basically, the thickness of the fabric is
measured..

80
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,650
to check the thickness of the fabric so in
this t-shirt the fabric thickness is..

81
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,069
so in this 230 gsm is used and literally,

82
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:11,069
the premium texture will be felt by you.

83
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:12,230
the fabric is very stretchy inspite of being
cotton.

84
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,230
stretches like elastic.

85
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,740
if you want to know my reviews on this t-shirt,
then you will have to watch the video till

86
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,740
the end.

87
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,860
now lets move to the next amazing t-shirt.

88
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,850
so here we have the t-shirt..

89
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,959
you must have watched people wearing the same
t-shirt.

90
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:26,959
The name of the t-shirt is messed -it!

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,220
which means a mess is created!

92
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,129
we get a tag of overlays.

93
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:35,100
mrp is 1599 but you have to very less amount
if the product will be left or not.

94
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,160
this t-shirt is oversized and come with a
design of multiple patch work.

95
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
with multiple colours in it.

96
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,340
one side you will have a lot of dark grey,

97
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,690
another side little bit of cream color,

98
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,120
another side is the blue color.

99
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,170
the neckline is black in colour.

100
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,080
not only with the difference in colour patches,
but you get different fabric material with

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
each color.

102
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:58,629
the whole t-shirt is from supima but the texture
and feeling is different from one another.

103
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,019
the 4 patches you see over here is..

104
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,760
this dedicates to any sign of space

105
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,010
it's that alien which tried to communicate
with others,

106
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,010
who threw the stone?

107
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,530
down you have the branding of overlays.

108
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,019
at the back of the neck, we have the overlays
branding.

109
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,080
the next thing you will notice is,

110
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,909
that not only through the colour it is made,
but the fabrics are properly cut and stitched

111
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:18,909
to make this t-shirt.

112
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:21,180
definitely, it took a lot of work for sure.

113
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,870
the grey part you see here..

114
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,080
these fabrics is made at 230 gsm.

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,559
moreover, the texture is a little bit rough
according to me.

116
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:31,259
if you have to wear comfy wear, then these
blue and cream part feels the same.

117
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,900
t shirt is very good, very comfortable and
nice fitting and is a oversized t-shirt.

118
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,979
it matches with the trend indeed.

119
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,569
lets move to the next t-shirt!

120
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:44,289
we bought 5 t-shirts and here we have another
box with burnt hakka noodles in it.

121
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:47,639
we talked to the team of overlays clothing
at their old launch.

122
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:55,809
but don't know what happened after that but
this is not a sponsored video...

123
00:04:55,809 --> 00:05:08,800
i have purchased all these products with my
own money so that i show you.

124
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,699
and i get to experience about everything.

125
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,919
this white t-shirtb which you saw at the beginning,

126
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,379
with the same design, the same cloth, and
the same waffle fabric.

127
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:19,119
the only thing is it has different elements,

128
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:26,189
In the front we have a pocket with a thread
design on the sides,

129
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:31,930
The colour of the thread is grey, with the
same grey neckline with more thread designs

130
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,719
at the back.

131
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:45,589
at the end of the sleeves, you have grey borders,

132
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:47,039
and this t-shirt is designed as an oversized
fit,

133
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,180
the name of the t-shirt is a white waffle
oversized t-shirt with olive rib.

134
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,839
the team says it is as an olive green t-shirt
but it looks grey to me and us.

135
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,409
maybe it has some magic inside.

136
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:03,050
the mrp of this t-shirt is 1399/- but you
dont have to pay this much.

137
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,729
i dont have more to say about this t-shirt,
if we talk about looks?

138
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:12,419
again its a very fine t-shirt, the b-roll
will tell you how am i looking in this t-shirt.

139
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,629
next, we move to the last t-shirt!

140
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:19,030
by the grace of the god, we will also do such
things one day!

141
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,699
lets open the next t-shirt, the name of the
t-shirt is...

142
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:23,699
RUNWAY!

143
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,070
its a full black t-shirt....

144
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,369
with some grey design in the middle.

145
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:28,639
about that, i will explain...

146
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,229
lets talk about the price, the price written
here is 1399/- which you dont have to pay..

147
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:34,349
tag with overlays branding,

148
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:38,259
inside you have a patch of overlays, down
you have one more small patch.

149
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,699
this t-shirt is also made of supima fabrics.

150
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,819
definitely the thickness, its the same very
good,

151
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,789
and this t-shirt is made at 222..

152
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:45,789
.....

153
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:46,789
222 gsm made.

154
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:48,869
it has a round neck and short sleeves..

155
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:54,869
you dont get a lot of design in it.

156
00:06:54,869 --> 00:07:01,210
a runway sort of thing is made on the t-shirt
and some strokes on the sleeve is made.

157
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:08,399
thus, this is a small design element which
looks cool.

158
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,979
these t-shirts speak more of the quality and
not the designs.

159
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:15,479
might happen you dont like the design on the
website but when you,

160
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:24,780
touch it, you will feel a different experience.

161
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:40,119
that you never have hold such a piece of cloth
neither wore it.

162
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:45,270
if you loved watching these t-shirts then
you can like it and go.

163
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,559
lets talk about the pros and cons..

164
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:53,949
pros is the cloth of these t-shirts are of
very good quality.

165
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:58,300
and literally, any youtuber or any website,
will never serve these premium clothes.

166
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,319
from packaging to the clothes there were no
use of plastic,

167
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:12,919
i found that 
a very good thing!

168
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:18,330
lets talk about the cons..

169
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,210
now all the cons i will be talking about is

170
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:27,809
they are not cons but improvements..

171
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:31,639
which the company can hear as a customer advice.

172
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,740
about what they can improve and what not?

173
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,200
the first problem which i found was..

174
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,630
that in any cloth among these 5, there is
no instructions given about...

175
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,660
the fabric, like the type of fabric? is that
supima or anything else?

176
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,280
the second thing was, the body fitting was
good but...

177
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,670
but the sleeves were not so flattering and
looks as if they were running...

178
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,520
if i have wore this t-shirt and the sleeve
is running,

179
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,780
then this thing personally does not looks
good.

180
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,760
the t-shirt mounting freely doesn't look nice.

181
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,900
