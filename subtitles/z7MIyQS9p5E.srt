Hello, my name is Anpu and welcome to my YouTube channel and today

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:12,840
I wanted to you know introduce the Indian accent to you, and I am very well aware that there is a

3
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:16,090
big variety of

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:22,709
Indian accents, and not just Indian there is a Sri Lankan, Pakistani, and you know all over a South asia,

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,550
there is different accent, but I want to to introduce to you the South Indian accent. You know

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,830
I am very interested in accents

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,729
And I you know if you ever interested in learning the Indian accent and perhaps you have a you know at acting role

8
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,730
Where you have to learn Indian accent this video will cover the basics of the Indian accent

9
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,090
So without further ado let's get straight into this video

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,780
Let's just address the elephant in the room

11
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,129
You were clearly judging me on my Indian accent weren't you?

12
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:09,150
You know I'm also passionate about like you know identity and racism, but that is not the topic of today's discussion

13
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,549
Today's discussion is about the Indian accent and if you follow as few simple steps and a few simple rules

14
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,460
You'll be able to master the Indian accent. You know really easily

15
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,740
Let's start off with the t sound so the t sounds something like this

16
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,640
[tur]

17
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,269
[tur] not [t]... [tur] ... so your tongue is actually further back in your mouth

18
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:35,459
so for example if you want to say the word 'but', in the Indian accent it's 'but'

19
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,829
'But'...okay, so not 'but'... 'but'... so let's try

20
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,399
dot

21
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,429
It's not dot it's not

22
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,579
Okay, so I'm really exaggerating the t here

23
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,749
so try and practice that sound yeah, and

24
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,729
Then [tone] it down a little bit so dot yeah it

25
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:00,359
It it

26
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:09,238
It so in the sentence don't try it becomes don't try it

27
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,370
don't

28
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,680
Try it

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,319
so once you've practiced that the next sound practice is the L sound so

30
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,559
Let's take the word table for example

31
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,569
When we say the word table, we don't actually pronounce the L in table

32
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:34,529
You've got the t sound which we talked about earlier and this L sound so practice to start not teh

33
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,620
t and

34
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,670
Then it becomes

35
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,439
Peru

36
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,269
Peru

37
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:45,599
not table table

38
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:50,729
So can you put the you know groceries on the table?

39
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:57,659
please the next sound is the w sound so British people will pronounce w as work and

40
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,030
so the word water

41
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:03,299
turns into vodka

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,809
Okay, so the w turns into a V and

43
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,219
Then the t in water is the sound that we practiced earlier

44
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,480
and

45
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,549
Then the R is what the last sound is what we're going to practice. So art isn't rough. It's rough

46
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,730
so var Dad

47
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,299
Var det another one could be pizza beep done

48
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:34,049
Peter I

49
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,409
spoke to be Dead on the Phone I

50
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,399
Spoke to Peter on the phone

51
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:45,418
Alright, so I'm sure you can hear that difference there

52
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:52,499
and I've tried to break down the particular sounds that sound different, so go away and practice that and

53
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:54,940
You know I might do a part two

54
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,479
So hit like on this video if you found that video useful and you know this this video is not intended to make fun out
