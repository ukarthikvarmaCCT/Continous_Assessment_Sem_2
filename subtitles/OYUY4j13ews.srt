1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:02,414
I have to leave for my
solo trip in the morning.

2
00:00:02,841 --> 00:00:04,709
I am going on a solo
trip after so many years.

3
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:06,426
I have a lot of work to do.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,772
And I am busy in seeing partnership
between Kohli and Dhoni.

5
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:11,500
Packing?

6
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:15,342
I have just started charging my gadgets.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,550
I have set an alarm for 4.30am.

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,585
And now the time is,

9
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:26,932
1:16 am.

10
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:35,585
- The number you have
dialed is not responding.

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,476
- Please try again later.

12
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:39,025
I will miss my flight after some time.

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,000
Driver on the way. Please don't be late.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,174
Your driver is late.

15
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:54,520
Saved

16
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:55,826
My boarding pass was fallen.

17
00:01:06,648 --> 00:01:07,722
Let me tell you one thing.

18
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:10,044
If you are not feeling well.

19
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:12,000
Especially if you have a cold.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,210
Don't travel in an aircraft.

21
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:14,882
There is a pressure difference.

22
00:01:15,124 --> 00:01:17,000
Your ears will hurt a lot.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,601
I have a lot of friends like this.

24
00:01:19,254 --> 00:01:21,000
Their ears saved from burst.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,553
I am also not feeling well.

26
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:23,975
And today is Monday
and today i have a fast.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,303
But I have to eat something,
I have to take medicine.

28
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:28,946
I am missing only one
thing on this highway.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,346
When I cycled.

30
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:33,442
I used to cycle along the side of the road.

31
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:36,613
From morning to evening.

32
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,512
I used to cycle for 14 hours a day.

33
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:43,754
Let's have tea and take medicine.

34
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:45,038
Then move ahead.

35
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,940
The place where I have
to go is 280 km from here.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,240
I have come to
Chhattisgarh for the first time.

37
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:53,101
I have heard that Chhattisgarh
is a good place for tourism.

38
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:54,401
But it is unexplored.

39
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:56,868
And the resort where I
am staying is amazing.

40
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:58,134
Let's check out.

41
00:01:58,177 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's have tea first.

42
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,000
Give me tea.

43
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:02,394
Are you making hot samosas?

44
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:04,546
Make two cups, okay.

45
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,566
Samosas are being
made early in the morning.

46
00:02:07,716 --> 00:02:08,884
- Does samosas serves for breakfast here?

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,130
- Samosa, Puri, Sabji
- Samosa, Puri, Sabji

48
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:42,414
Let's go.

49
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,528
Now, i am leaveing for..

50
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:56,710
When I used to do vlogging
before the lockdown.

51
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:59,102
I used to travel solo.

52
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:08,835
You guys gave me a lot of love.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,838
We went to Meghalaya.

54
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:11,863
You bumper loved the Meghalaya series.

55
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:13,432
And when you go alone.

56
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:15,975
You are stopping somewhere,
to set up the camera.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,222
You have to shoot according to yourself.

58
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:18,621
When you go with your family.

59
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:19,702
You can't do those things.

60
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:22,000
There is a lot of
restriction with the family.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,825
There are kids.

62
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:24,029
When I was in college.

63
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:26,000
I was not interested in traveling.

64
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:28,000
From our college in Kharagpur.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,096
Freinds used to go to the beach.

66
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:30,925
I said I won't go.

67
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,928
But then I started traveling actively.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,144
Because of vlogging.

69
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:37,960
I said let's travel to make
good content for the vlog.

70
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,000
But it happened like this.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,087
I went to the start for that reason.

72
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:41,321
But while traveling.

73
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,000
I fell in love with traveling.

74
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:46,028
Then Ritu and I started traveling together.

75
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:47,195
To make a vlog together.

76
00:03:47,763 --> 00:03:50,692
After traveling, Ritu said
I won't travel anymore.

77
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:53,000
But I wanted to travel more.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,508
Because I was getting
addicted to traveling.

79
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:57,000
But then Rashi grewed up.

80
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:58,441
Slowly more work increased.

81
00:03:58,466 --> 00:03:59,625
More responsibilities increased.

82
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:00,614
Lockdown started.

83
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,017
Then solo traveling stopped suddenly.

84
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,602
Then I had to take the
kids with me anywhere i go.

85
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:06,363
After so many years.

86
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:08,000
I am on solo travel.

87
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:11,686
Maybe that passion will leave
inside from you very soon.

88
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:13,047
That passion will not remain a passion.

89
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:14,849
There is a very fine line.

90
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:16,744
That's why I said to
Ritu that I will go alone.

91
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:19,057
Because I really

92
00:04:19,863 --> 00:04:21,164
like this thing.

93
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:23,342
Solo travel vlogs.

94
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:25,400
If you like it too.

95
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:26,436
Please appreciate it.

96
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:29,541
It was so nice to leave this highway.

97
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,856
Greenery everywhere.

98
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:33,913
Such a beautiful highway.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,752
Greenery is everywhere.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,150
In rainy season.

101
00:04:37,885 --> 00:04:38,885
Everything is green.

102
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,186
And our country is so beautiful.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,513
This is the country where
you will find Himalayas,

104
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:45,000
Ganga,

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,316
Desert,

106
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,000
Beautiful beaches.

107
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,761
Hill station.

108
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:51,360
And in Kashmir.

109
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:52,506
In Gulmarg.

110
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:54,210
You will find snowy valleys.

111
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,396
There are so many Kawadiya.

112
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,177
You will find them on this road.

113
00:04:58,203 --> 00:05:00,733
Our traditions, customs.

114
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,770
The villages of india,

115
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,656
People who is living
there have kept them alive.

116
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:07,825
If someone works in a
multinational company.

117
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,212
Lives in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore.

118
00:05:09,237 --> 00:05:11,975
Whoever has to go to take
Kawad, then there is no time.

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,497
They are overburdened with
work, they are busy with work.

120
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,108
We they get a day off.

121
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:17,000
then there is work at home too.

122
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:18,514
Are you planting rice?

123
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:19,416
Planting?

124
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:20,646
Can I come and see?

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,973
Let's see.

126
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:22,948
Wow.

127
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,384
- Does it implement
like this? Wow, just throw it

128
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:28,064
It hit my foot.

129
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,136
How long does it take
to plant a whole field?

130
00:05:36,022 --> 00:05:37,883
I have listen that, does
snake come in planting rice?

131
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:38,634
- Yes

132
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:39,168
Oh it comes?

133
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:39,697
- Yes

134
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:41,748
So, is a snake non-poisonous
or is it poisonous?

135
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,638
- Poisonous one

136
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:43,618
What are you saying, really ?

137
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:45,057
Have you ever been bitten?

138
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,352
- A man passed away?

139
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:47,400
Yes.

140
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:48,618
While planting rice?

141
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:49,832
- Yes
- Ohh sister

142
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,630
So do you keep the medicines?

143
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:53,947
- No medicines, goes
straight to the hospital.

144
00:05:54,943 --> 00:05:59,896
If they have luck then they will
survive, otherwise they don't.

145
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:04,461
Don't you feel scared?

146
00:06:04,483 --> 00:06:04,765
?

147
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:06,478
So sister why don't you feel scared?

148
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:07,594
- No we don't feel scared

149
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:08,235
Don't feel scared?

150
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,196
- This is our job, so what fear?

151
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:11,221
This is also true.

152
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:14,036
We are farmers, so who fears?

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
- Now may be snake sitting in the water,

154
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:21,000
What can we do, if i see the snake.

155
00:06:22,277 --> 00:06:24,681
Is there always this much
water in the rice fields?

156
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:25,348
Always ?

157
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:27,132
The best thing i like is,

158
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:29,383
They have practice of it like they
are throwing it and it get settled.

159
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:31,207
Look at this.

160
00:06:31,346 --> 00:06:32,950
It was nice meeting them.

161
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,727
But it was bit surprising that,

162
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:38,708
They have threat that
snake comes and bite them.

163
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,186
But still they are planting rice.

164
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:42,494
If they don't sow, we won't get food.

165
00:06:42,555 --> 00:06:44,555
Planting rice means risking the life.

166
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:46,660
 3-4 people says,

167
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,426
They run to towards the hospital,
3-4 people have died here.

168
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:51,729
It's a very difficult
work, sometimes i think.

169
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,000
So much risk of life in this work.

170
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,465
But they will hardly make any
money, hardly they will make.

171
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:01,629
There are so many crops in the
middle man, they don't get anything.

172
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,828
When we went to Ritu's
village, they had such a big field.

173
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:07,142
They said they will plant the whole
field, whatever crops they plant.

174
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:08,300
Finally, they earned

175
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:11,064
40-45 thousand in this much.

176
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:13,688
- Kawad is going?

177
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:20,767
I got real fun of travel is when
you stop and talk to people.

178
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,369
They don't say yes, they
have learned a new thing.

179
00:07:22,394 --> 00:07:23,448
They say, How, How.

180
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:24,799
Is there tea here? Yes

181
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,208
Earlier, I was very shy
when I didn't start vlogging.

182
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,849
So I couldn't talk to anyone.

183
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:31,448
But the benefit of vlogging
is that I have opened up a lot.

184
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:34,000
I can talk to people, talk to them.

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,728
And you will see, when you
have your own inhibition, y

186
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:39,661
our own shame, I talk to them
and they are so welcoming.

187
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:42,701
The real fun of travel is not in
the destination, but on the way.

188
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,621
There is life with family too,
but this is my therapy that I travel.

189
00:07:45,646 --> 00:07:46,304
It's a lot of fun.

190
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:49,575
But the problem with me is
that I have to go 250 kilometers.

191
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,757
GPS is showing, it's a 5-hour journey.

192
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:53,802
But it will take me 7-8 hours.

193
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,582
And what I go to explore,
it happened many times.

194
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:58,216
It happened on my last trip too.

195
00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:00,302
The place where I am
going is closed at 5 o'clock.

196
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,238
I am reaching at 6 o'clock.

197
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:04,838
The roads are so much
fun, what you are seeing.

198
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:07,600
But where we are going, they
are saying that it has rained.

199
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Maybe the place is closed.

200
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,775
Look at Gau Mata.

201
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,268
Gau Mata got no chill on the way.

202
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,505
It's 12.15 pm.

203
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,000
There is a 4-hour long way left from here.

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,281
Now we have come to the old highway.

205
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:21,975
I can't stop myself after seeing tea.

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,465
You put such a big board for tea.

207
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:24,505
Without sugar.

208
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:26,973
And I need that stuff at any cost.

209
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:28,600
I can't complete the trip without it.

210
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,736
It's near the bank.

211
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:30,693
Yes, it's here.

212
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:35,357
When I was packing
for this trip last night,

213
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:36,102
I had a problem.

214
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:37,832
Because my travel is so back-to-back.

215
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:39,634
I just come home for
a day and then I leave.

216
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,094
When I sat down to pack,

217
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:41,976
 I realized.

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,600
Ritu.

219
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,690
Hey Ritu.

220
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:45,805
Where are you?

221
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:46,600
Here.

222
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:48,980
I don't have any underwear
what should I do pack?

223
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,010
Why?

224
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:51,334
Not a single underwear.

225
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,929
What I wore today's was the last one.

226
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:54,137
what dream did you have?

227
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,750
 Am I asking for a underwear in your dream?

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,693
- Yes

229
00:08:57,768 --> 00:08:58,089
Wow.

230
00:08:58,688 --> 00:08:59,930
We had to do this shopping.

231
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:01,233
It was very important.

232
00:09:01,738 --> 00:09:03,106
It's good that main highway was closed.

233
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:04,555
So, we entered the city a little.

234
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,136
Now we will live freely for 4 days.

235
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,975
Otherwise, it feels like 4
days in one underwear.

236
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,890
How bro?

237
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:26,748
There are some things in
life that you do only by feeling.

238
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,227
When you play cricket, no matter
how many techniques you have,

239
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:31,388
you always play with
the feel of the pitch.

240
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,380
When I used to do landing in the aircraft,

241
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:36,561
No matter how many techniques
you learn, but every landing is a feel.

242
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Similarly, a car.

243
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:41,000
You are driving a car with
a manual transmission gear.

244
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:42,000
The technique is the same.

245
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:46,192
But still, in every car, you will take
10 minutes in the beginning to feel.

246
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:47,588
How big is the car?

247
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:48,561
What is the size of the car?

248
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:50,328
But especially this gear transmission.

249
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The combination of gear and clutch.

250
00:09:53,657 --> 00:09:55,000
To feel it.

251
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:56,601
It will take you 10 minutes.

252
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:58,626
No matter how many techniques you have.

253
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:02,592
And in life it is very important to
know when to change the gear.

254
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:06,286
If you go whole life in the same gear.

255
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:08,765
Then you won't have fun in life.

256
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,088
You should know when
your time is not right.

257
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,872
So drive in 1st gear.

258
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,973
And when your time is right and
the wind is blowing towards you.

259
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,673
Then drive in 5th gear

260
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,493
- You will get to see the
whole of Chhattisgarh.

261
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:29,561
It is being broadcasted on
the radio that Lord Ram,

262
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:32,135
Had passed by Raipur somewhere.

263
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,197
There is a tree planting on the road
going on and school kids are doing it.

264
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:37,592
- How much for the banana?

265
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:38,592
Rs. 50?

266
00:10:39,046 --> 00:10:40,042
It will cost you Rs.130

267
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:41,638
Give it to me.

268
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:43,370
- Dantewada

269
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:45,314
While driving, I was very sleepy.

270
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,713
Let's take a break.

271
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,957
When I leave the house in the morning,

272
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:51,320
There were a milk truck
overturned on the road.

273
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:54,000
I am thinking of getting a Red Bull.

274
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,980
It is difficult to get a Red Bull here.

275
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,061
Bro, a lot of difference is
made by stay for a while and eating here.

276
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:00,346
I lost all sleep.

277
00:11:01,116 --> 00:11:02,905
The mountain road has started.

278
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:15,115
And it is very beautiful.

279
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,797
Green belts on both sides

280
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,228
Chhattisgarh Valleys.

281
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:21,960
We are passing by a place called Kesh Kaal.

282
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,219
From Kesh Kaal we are
going to Chitrakoot Waterfall.

283
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:28,136
It is almost 2 hours away

284
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:30,836
Whole city has been left and
again highway has started.

285
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:32,010
I had left the hope

286
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:33,853
That I would get food today.

287
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:35,141
I have ordered food.

288
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:36,850
The food was very good.

289
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,870
We also had coffee.

290
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,093
It was fun.

291
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:43,201
But the bad news is that the place
where are we going closes at 6 pm.

292
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,000
And it is 5.20 now

293
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:47,016
So we are going to Chitrakoot Waterfall.

294
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,000
Which is India's Niagara fall.

295
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:50,068
When I went to Canada

296
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,529
I started vlogging on Fit Muscle.

297
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:53,192
No one knows that.

298
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:54,311
I have never shared it

299
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:55,656
I started vlogging on Fit Muscle

300
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:55,990
Then,

301
00:11:56,252 --> 00:11:57,805
I went to Canada and started there.

302
00:11:58,438 --> 00:11:59,418
The work that I do

303
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:00,644
The work that I believe in

304
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:02,136
I don't do it slowly

305
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:03,125
I do it very blasting.

306
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,454
I bought expensive cameras, drones.

307
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:07,817
At that time, no one knew me for vlogging.

308
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:10,211
Mom-Dad told me to start it slowly,

309
00:12:10,236 --> 00:12:11,428
When you grew up, everybody know you.

310
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,661
Then you can buy it.

311
00:12:13,085 --> 00:12:13,605
I said no

312
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,853
I want a drone.

313
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:17,810
Because I have the
confidence that I will do it.

314
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,408
So now  don't know, where
I have reached from there.

315
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:20,910
We made a vlog then at that time.

316
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,018
It became famous as Niagara Falls.

317
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:24,956
It was a vlog on  Fit Muscle

318
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:26,800
I started vlogging on Fit Muscle TV.

319
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,289
We are already late

320
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,376
And we came back

321
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:31,537
I am so unlucky today

322
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:32,550
I don't know what to say

323
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Chitrakoot Road

324
00:12:35,164 --> 00:12:36,362
When I was passing from here

325
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:38,124
I saw such a beautiful road

326
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:39,191
Such beautiful fields

327
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:42,975
Chhattisgarh is so beautiful,
I didn't know until today.

328
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,813
But it was very beautiful.

329
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:46,890
So I thought

330
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:48,626
We are not going to reach anyway

331
00:12:49,164 --> 00:12:51,315
Why not stop and fly the drone.

332
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,670
Bro, Is Chitrakoot is straight from here?

333
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,053
Finally reached the room.

334
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:03,925
I got a little more bad news.

335
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,821
There is no boating here at the moment.

336
00:13:05,846 --> 00:13:07,544
Because there is a lot
of water in the waterfall.

337
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:10,098
Don't worry, Keep your courage high.

338
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:14,069
This is the best waterfall in India.

339
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:15,874
And it looks like this from the balcony

340
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:16,786
I will show you in the morning.

341
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:18,305
Very amazing

342
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,163
The day was very long

343
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:19,928
We were very tired

344
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,350
Now

345
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:21,090
Bye Bye

346
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:21,650
Let's sleep.

347
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:24,588
They have put something.

348
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:26,681
Welcome Flying Beast

349
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:28,584
Not a bad day.

350
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:29,217
They have put something.

351
00:13:29,473 --> 00:13:30,544
Thank you so much.

352
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:32,842
To make this bad day a little better.

353
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:33,421
It's down too.

354
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:37,558
But dirty...

355
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:41,460
This

356
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,602
This

357
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,257
Who put this here.

358
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:50,531
Closed it from outside.

359
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:52,209
Who was here?

360
00:13:52,234 --> 00:13:53,086
Don't be seen.

361
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:56,767
SEH LENGE THODA
