1
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:09,424
My name's Rangeeli.

2
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:19,428
The name's Rangeeli.

3
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:21,248
I have a sharp tongue.

4
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:24,249
My work is neat and clean.

5
00:00:24,844 --> 00:00:27,067
And I am sharp
to count the bills.

6
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:30,423
No one can trick me.

7
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,433
I am a storm.

8
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:35,198
So should I say all that again
or come to the point?

9
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:44,788
Whoever you are.
Rangeeli or whatever.

10
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:46,349
Why should we care?

11
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:48,803
Tell me something.

12
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:53,158
How dare you enter
our house shamelessly like that?

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,232
Hasn't anyone taught you?

14
00:00:56,568 --> 00:00:58,841
When elders are talking,

15
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:02,703
you should not stick
your big nose in it.

16
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:07,836
Never mind.

17
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:10,274
Now that you have asked,
let me answer it.

18
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:17,695
What happened is
I was walking down the street.

19
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:23,233
And I heard the sweet
melody of a Lord Krishna prayers.

20
00:01:23,515 --> 00:01:27,109
So I thought let me
enjoy that.

21
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:32,765
Look,
God doesn't discriminate.

22
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:35,359
Everyone is welcome to his abode.

23
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:39,931
Say it aloud,
Glory to Lord Krishna.

24
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,979
Stop the nonsense.

25
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:43,458
Let me make it
clear to you.

26
00:01:43,588 --> 00:01:45,987
This is our home
and not some temple or charity home

27
00:01:46,137 --> 00:01:47,656
where you can just barge in.

28
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:48,559
Get lost.

29
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:53,962
Firstly, I feel only you do
the talking here.

30
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:59,247
Okay, Let me get to the point.

31
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:03,167
A little birdie told me

32
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:08,815
that you need a hard-working,
smart maid.

33
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:13,223
But I do not work for anybody
or everybody.

34
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:20,206
Before I start working,
I make sure I know each member well.

35
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:29,925
Actually with God's grace,
I am here anyway.

36
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:33,050
So I'll stay here
for a few days.

37
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:35,143
And better your lives too.

38
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,581
You are mistaken.

39
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:46,427
We don't need a maid.

40
00:02:46,663 --> 00:02:52,129
Mister, you should never be hasty
when it comes to your needs.

41
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,907
If I leave,
I'll not come back

42
00:02:56,073 --> 00:03:00,586
for anyone or anything.

43
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:01,695
Very good.

44
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,394
So you better leave.
We don't need you. Out.

45
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:06,634
Hey!

46
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,224
Liar, liar.

47
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:23,692
You shouldn't lie.

48
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,318
Well, the moment I saw this house,

49
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:37,695
I understood there is a lot that needs
to be fixed in this house.

50
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:40,300
It is full of filth.

51
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:52,699
I mean I'll have
to clean every corner of this house.

52
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:58,691
I have had enough of your nonsense.
Get lost.

53
00:04:24,128 --> 00:04:25,811
Don't you get it?

54
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,281
We don't need a maid.

55
00:04:27,696 --> 00:04:28,733

56
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:35,172

58
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:51,009
Did you see that?

59
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:52,780
She is a mere servant.

60
00:04:52,904 --> 00:04:55,491
But has the attitude
of the boss.

61
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:01,373
You are the elder
of this family.

62
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:02,636
Your face...

63
00:05:06,568 --> 00:05:07,792
From your face,

64
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:11,335
I can say that you
call the shots here.

65
00:05:13,203 --> 00:05:16,611
Tell them to hire me.

66
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,081
Dadiya.
Just Dadiya.

67
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:28,335
Dadiya, there is no dearth
of work for me.

68
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:34,345
But the thing I am facing
a financial crunch now.

69
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:39,559
In short, I need work, desperately.

70
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,384
I am a girl from a poor family.

71
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:46,128
So I am looking for work
in order to sustain myself.

72
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:49,377
This girl is amazing.

73
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:51,671
On one hand,
she is begging for work.

74
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:54,074
On the other hand,
she is disrespecting my mother.

75
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,721
Stay within your limits, girl.

76
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,983
All this coming from an uncouth like you...

77
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,904
Enough. I have shown
you enough respect.

78
00:06:01,984 --> 00:06:03,613
I have had enough
of your ranting.

79
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:06,703
If you want respect,

80
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,859
learn to speak respectfully.

81
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,780
You are so silly, Rangeeli.

82
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:18,483
You are expecting her
to show respect.

83
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:23,846
Dadiya, tell me.

84
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:25,286
Will you hire me?

85
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:26,351
No.

86
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:31,239
We do not need a maid.

87
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:35,217
Leave.

88
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:36,684
Don't say that.

89
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:39,418
Look, I can do all the chores.

90

Cleaning, mopping,
doing the dishes.

91
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:45,177
From oil massage
to polish the shoes.

92
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:46,293
I can do everything.

I will apply the orange peel
to your face

94
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:53,145
and make you look so radiant

95
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,263
that you will put
these young people to shame.

96
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,633
Please, Dadiya.

97
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:59,267
Will you hire me?
Please.

98
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,052
Listen pretty girl,

99

I find you to be the prettiest
and the most sorted in this house.

100
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,309
I am sure,
everyone listens to you.

101
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,942
Tell them to hire me, please.

102
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:27,737
I said,
we don't need you.

103
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,157
Stop your nonsense
and leave.

104
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,738
Heard that?

105
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,781
We don't need a maid.
Take your things and leave.

106
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:39,717
- Come on.
- Stop, Aunty.

107
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:53,133
Dadiya, it is a virtuous thing
to help the needy.

108
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:56,953
I wonder why I feel
we should hire her.

109
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,974
You are right.

110
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:02,944
But hiring someone
without verification

111
00:08:03,146 --> 00:08:06,200
or without knowing her
is not right.

112
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:09,109
Yes, Dadiya.

113
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,562
It's 'Janmashtami' today.

114
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:12,920
An auspicious day.

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,460
And it is not right to turn a needy
away on a festive occasion.

116
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:20,859
You have a point.

117
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:24,983

118
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:32,662

You will work very hard

Don't bother.
Get up.

125
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,746
Make her understand.

126
00:08:58,099 --> 00:09:01,862
If she wants to stay here
then she should talk less.

127

It's Dadiya's orders,

so I will accept it.

181
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:46,752
I could get into this house
only because of you.

182
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:48,783
This has been possible
only because of you.

183
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,687
This is your battle.

184
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:54,064
I am just supporting you.

185
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:55,802
What are your plans now?

186
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,885
I have planned it all
and I will be executing it soon.

187
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:07,989
Oh, my.
The kitchen is so dirty.

188
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:11,585
Dirty dishes?
Raghu, Mamta, where the hell are you?

189
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:13,653
Just a sec.

190
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:16,884
We have a new maid now.
What's her name?

191
00:15:17,004 --> 00:15:17,886
Chhabili?

192
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:20,765
No, it's not Chhabili.
It's Rangeeli.

193
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,806
Damn it.

194
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:24,045
I guess she must be
sleeping soundly.

195
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,341
Very good.
She made such tall claims.

196
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,437
But she is good for nothing.

197
00:15:32,894 --> 00:15:39,147
Sushma, it's time
to do what you do best.

198
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:04,955
Today, I'll do something

199
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:11,607
that makes her shudder even
at the sight of me.

200
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,947
There was a girl with Vinayak
on the cliff that day,

201
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,888
who was whistling like this.

202
00:16:23,018 --> 00:16:24,991
I don't know who she is

203
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:27,775
or why she was
supporting Vinayak?

204
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:30,575
And that's why I have come
here posing as a maid.

205
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:33,116
Because a wife
can bear anything

206
00:16:33,821 --> 00:16:36,571
except for betrayal
by her husband.

207
00:16:47,951 --> 00:16:52,378
This smoke
will teach Rangeeli a lesson,

208
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:54,875
she'll never forget.

209
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,232
If that girl is colluding
with Vinayak,

210
00:16:57,312 --> 00:17:00,357
I am sure she is still
in touch with Vinayak.

211
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,683
I must find out
who that girl is.

212
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,201
I swear.

213
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:08,769
There must have been an
earthquake the day you were born.

214
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,963
Because your intentions, mind
and heart and your actions are evil.

215
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,965
That's why you tried to
suffocate me with this smoke.

216
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:23,040
Should I tell your mother
about your misdeeds?

217
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:24,484
Shut up.

218
00:18:24,564 --> 00:18:26,265
Never mind complaining about me.

219
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:30,054
Get ready to face the music.

220
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,589
Let's go.

221
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:34,225
Hey, you snob, where are you...

222
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:36,822
Do you see these dirty dishes?

223
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:43,176
They are craving
a thorough cleaning by you.

224
00:18:44,387 --> 00:18:45,696
And this mess here.

225
00:18:46,098 --> 00:18:50,376
Only Rangeeli is going to clean it.

226
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:51,480
Do you understand?

227
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:55,208
You are the maid.
Don't try to be the boss here.

228
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:57,900
You think you can freeload, right?

229
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:01,925
You have a sharp tongue.

230
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:05,391
So now start using your hands
and clean the house.

231
00:19:05,516 --> 00:19:08,621
The maid wants to be the boss here.

232
00:19:12,174 --> 00:19:14,032
Great.

233
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:19,825
The belch tells me
that you have stuffed yourself.

234
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,007
You have stuffed yourself
but you want to keep your maid hungry.

235
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:24,866
Let me be clear.

236
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:27,545
I'll eat and then do the work.

237
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,058
Glory to Lord Krishna.

238
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:32,719
As you wish.

239
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:36,645
- Maya.
- Here, have some milk, Rangeeli.

240
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:39,131
Thank you, pretty madam.

241
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,682
I knew it.

242
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:43,310
You are the only one
in this house who understands me

243
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,023
and can help me succeed
in my efforts.

244
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,174
Hold on.

245
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:51,950
She can't have the milk.

246
00:19:52,073 --> 00:19:53,831
Let her finish her work first.

247
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:58,257
I am going to have it.

248
00:19:58,391 --> 00:19:59,519
Aunty...

249
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:09,921
'I got it to find out
Rangeeli's secrets.'

250
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,928
'But the stupid woman
drank it instead.'

251
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:20,352
Oh, God.

252
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:23,568
What the hell was in the milk?

253
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:27,443
What happened to her?

254
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,073
She's smoking like Chandrayaan-3

255
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:34,139
from her ears and mouth.

256
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:41,424
Do something, Maya.
I'll die.

257
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:45,777
Have some water.

258
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:47,360
And have the sweet kept
as the offering.

259
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:48,447
You will feel better.

260
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:51,635
Yes, I am going.
Oh, Lord.

261
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:55,708
I don't know why
she was fluttering around.

262
00:20:56,577 --> 00:20:59,851
You know what?
Let me clean up this mess.

263
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:14,907
How did you know that
the cleaning items are kept there?

264
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:25,256
You have never been
in this kitchen before, right?

265
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:28,667
Tell me the truth.

266
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:32,604
How can anyone know
so much in such a short time?

267
00:21:38,526 --> 00:21:41,281
'Maya, I feel you'll catch me.'

268
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:45,126
'But I have come here
to save you from my evil husband.'

269
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:50,896
I am sure you know something
about us and this house.

270
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:52,619
Nothing like that.

271
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:56,835
Anyone can guess
where these things could be.

272
00:21:58,437 --> 00:22:00,612
And as far as
she is concerned,

273
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:03,361
let's assume that God has sent

274
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:07,396
me here to punish her
for her evil deeds.

275
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,286
How do you know
that Aunty's evil?

276
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:11,968
You don't even know her.

277
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:19,170
Anyone can guess
that she's a malicious woman.

278
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:25,269
Can you please move,
I have to clean this.

279
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:30,729
'She is very sharp.'

280
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:34,183
'I need to keep an eye on her.'

281
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:21,519
'On one hand,
is your hatred,'

282
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:24,981
'which I could never see
in your eyes or heart.'

283
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:29,097
'You hated me so much
that you tried to kill me.'

284
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,454
'And then there is me.'

285
00:23:31,054 --> 00:23:32,748
'I want revenge.'

286
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,714
'But I still love you
just as much. '

287
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:41,255
'I feel like giving
you a tight hug right now.'
