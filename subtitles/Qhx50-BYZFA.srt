1
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:15,672
'Agra (Uttar Pradesh).'

2
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,095
Glory to Lord Krishna.

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,119
Glory to Lord Krishna.

4
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:29,207
Wonder if she ever sleeps.

5
00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:32,471
Not a day has gone by

6
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:37,446
where she hasn't prepared the offerings,
well ahead of the prayers.

7
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:43,003
Glory to Lord Krishna.

8
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:53,505
It's not possible for Siddhi
to forget to keep the matchbox.

9
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:55,578
My daughter never forgets.

10
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:01,285
I had taken the matchbox
for some other use.

11
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:05,273
So now, stop blaming my daughter
in front of God, will you?

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,693
Siddhi has always been
the light of our lives.

13
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:19,965
It would've been difficult
to run the house

14
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:22,121
had she not become a confectioner
after your health issues.

15
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:27,618
She runs the shop and the house
and also takes care of Maya.

16
00:01:27,807 --> 00:01:31,313
She goes to bed after we sleep
but wakes up earlier than us.

17
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,073
Ever since your medical condition,
I've hardly seen her sleep.

18
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:40,084
Anyway, it's a special day for her.

19
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:43,471
She was to wake up at 4 a.m.
and leave for the shop.

20
00:01:47,268 --> 00:01:50,286
Do you think I could pull this off
had I not woken up at 4 a.m.?

21
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:54,737
All these sweet delicacies
and 'Laddus' made as offerings.

22
00:01:54,976 --> 00:01:58,494
Quickly pack them all
and send them to my house right away.

23
00:01:58,574 --> 00:01:59,613
Your house?

24
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:06,604
Ma'am, is there a prayer ceremony
at home today?

25
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:13,807
Not really but God grants this day
only after years of hard penance.

26
00:02:13,892 --> 00:02:16,198
Now hurry up, I'll be back at 9

27
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:20,508
fire up the oven and prepare the rest
of the sweets as per the order. Come on.

28
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:25,885
Do you even have a moment to breathe
amid all this hustle and bustle?

29
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,446
You truly are a one-man army.

30
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:32,528
Whenever I look at you,
only one thing comes to my mind.

31
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:36,032
"I wonder what this girl is made of!"

32
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:39,073
Though I'm Siddhi's stepmother

33
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:41,811
kids of this generation cannot match

34
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,930
the love and respect she has for me.

35
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,591
She loves Maya more than anyone.

36
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,494
She's an ideal sister.

37
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:56,105
With a sister like her,
do I need to ask more?

38
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:03,886
On this day, 22 years ago,
God gave me the most precious gift.

39
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,464
Since then, I've treasured her.

40
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:09,987
It's my Maya's birthday.

41
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:15,015
She maybe my daughter
but Siddhi loves her immensely.

42
00:03:15,593 --> 00:03:20,808
She has always shielded Maya
right from her childhood.

43
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,338
But where is she?

44
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:26,286
Glory to lord Krishna.

45
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:30,216
As it's Maya's birthday,
she must be celebrating it.

46
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,236
I guess, Maya is still asleep.

47
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:33,799
But I know the trick to wake her up.

48
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:30,796
"I'll be the shade for you
in the sunlight, a shadow by your side."

49
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:37,315
"I'll shower you with love,
my heart beats for you."

50
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,688
"My heart beats for you."

51
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:44,613
"My heart beats for you."

52
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:49,691
"I want you forever."

53
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:51,910
Happy happy birthday Maya!

54
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:55,470
It's Maya's birthday today.

55
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,486
I'm going to serve
you all my best desserts.

56
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:00,937
Come on.

57
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:15,264
Mr. Sharma's younger daughter
is so pretty.

58
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:17,599
She'll brighten up her groom's home.

59
00:06:17,785 --> 00:06:21,354
It's Maya's birthday. Let's dance, kids.

60
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:23,710
I guess, you are new here.

61
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,362
Let me unravel the truth to you.

62
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:02,907
Someone pushed me. Someone pushed Maya.

63
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:07,097
Let me go. Who dared to push me?

64
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,345
Who was it? Was it you?

65
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:11,655
Was it you who pushed Maya?

66
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,362
Was it you?

67
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:14,936
Was it you who pushed Maya?

68
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,692
Was it you? You?

69
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,527
Who pushed Maya?

70
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:21,325
- You?
- Calm down, Maya.

71
00:07:21,405 --> 00:07:24,009
I won't spare you. Was it you?

72
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:26,703
This is the true face
of the Sharma family.

73
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:32,332
One dusky, the other crazy.

74
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:43,016
Birthday drums resound here
but wedding drums will never roll.

75
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,000
I won't spare anyone.

76
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:51,328
Calm down.

77
00:07:51,462 --> 00:07:53,107
Who dared to push me?

78
00:07:53,187 --> 00:07:54,447
Who dared to push me?

79
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:56,519
I won't spare anyone.

80
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:57,851
I won't spare anyone.

81
00:07:57,931 --> 00:07:59,788
I'll shoot you all.

82
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:36,713
No matter what,
I promise to take care of Maya for life.

83
00:08:36,903 --> 00:08:40,360
As I'm the reason for her childlike state.

84
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:47,350
Due to me, she met with an accident at
the age of 12, which affected her brain.

85
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:49,826
And she became mentally challenged.

86
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:54,921
Siddhi, they pushed me.

87
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,093
They pushed me.

88
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:57,614
No one will be spared.

89
00:08:57,694 --> 00:08:59,272
- I'll kill everyone.
- Maya. Maya.

90
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:01,922
- I'll kill them all.
- Maya.

91
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:03,430
They pushed me.

92
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,154
Maya, I'm here.

93
00:09:24,645 --> 00:09:26,500
Maya is wise and brave.

94
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:29,077
She fearlessly walks her own way.

95
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,998
But she doesn't get enraged.

96
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:37,706
Siddhi is her sister.

97
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:41,454
I will stay with you forever!

98
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:53,632
Only Siddhi can handle her.
May they always be together.

99
00:09:57,317 --> 00:10:00,759
The groom will arrive with fanfare.

100
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:06,487
Anyhow, I'll find a perfect match
for Siddhi.

101
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,830
Maya.

102
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:19,821
Your birthday gift.

103
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:22,994
Gift! Wow, a gift.

104
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:32,414
Wow!

105
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,206
A car! Wow.

106
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,707
I'll drive it.

107
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:42,920
Maya, it will never run out of fuel.

108
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:46,023
Siddhi.

109
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:50,522
The last token of your late mother.

110
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,420
Always keep wearing it.

111
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,022
My mom used to wear it?

112
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:06,334
Dad, then I'll never take it out.

113
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:10,675
What is it?

114
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:14,715
A chain?

115
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:18,707
Why not one for me? Why only for her?

116
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,366
I want a similar one.

117
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:22,463
I want one right now.

118
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:26,043
No, don't do that. It's for Siddhi.

119
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:30,035
Why only for her and not me?

120
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:32,965
I want to wear one too.

121
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:34,814
I want one right now.

122
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:40,536
Okay, fine.
You will get the chain right away.

123
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:00,194
Wow, it's so pretty.

124
00:12:00,274 --> 00:12:01,899
Siddhi, you are really nice.

125
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:03,020
You are the best.

126
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:13,415
But dear, the chain...

127
00:12:13,495 --> 00:12:16,044
Dad, Maya and I are no different.

128
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:19,864
What belongs to Siddhi
also belongs to Maya.

129
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,001
What belongs to Siddhi
also belongs to Maya.

130
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:24,837
What belongs to Siddhi
also belongs to Maya.

131
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:27,008
What belongs to Siddhi
also belongs to Maya.

132
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,847
Siddhi, let's go to the temple.

133
00:12:30,927 --> 00:12:33,918
Let's race till there. Okay?

134
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:36,202
1, 2, 3. Go!

135
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:38,686
- Come on. - Dear, listen!
- Be careful. Dad, I'll be back.

136
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:43,936
Slowly, Maya. Slowly.

137
00:12:44,592 --> 00:12:47,575
Maya, stop.

138
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:49,521
Easy. Slowly.

139
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:51,197
Maya, stop.

140
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:02,797
Come on.

141
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:09,781
Siddhi, I'm already tired.

142
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:14,658
I can't climb all these stairs to pray.

143
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:16,213
Let's go back.

144
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:18,756
Maya, don't say that.

145
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:24,323
God will be offended, if you leave
without His blessings on your birthday.

146
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,822
But why can't God climb down to meet me?

147
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:32,791
I'm too tired to climb so many stairs.

148
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:51,020
Maya.

149
00:13:52,193 --> 00:13:58,018
"I'll be the shade for you
in the sunlight, a shadow by your side."

150
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:04,741
"I'll shower you with love,
my heart beats for you."

151
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:08,874
"My heart beats for you."

152
00:14:08,954 --> 00:14:09,972
"My heart beats for you."

153
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:13,408
Such a grown-up girl!
Yet she is a burden on her sister!

154
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:19,108
She isn't a burden
but a blessing from God for me.

155
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,439
Shall we?

156
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:34,942
You have found the perfect match for her
from a good family.

157
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:41,899
O' God,
the groom belongs to a respectable family.

158
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,248
I'll offer you 'Laddus' and money.

159
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:52,417
Don't let this wedding get fixed.

160
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:57,875
Maya won't survive without Siddhi.

161
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:01,924
I can't manage her on my own.

162
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:04,585
Besides, Siddhi earns for the family.

163
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:07,619
Please help.

164
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:10,881
Break off the alliance.

165
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:14,702
The groom's family is coming tomorrow
to meet Siddhi.

166
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:19,928
May her dusky complexion
not be an obstacle yet again.

167
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,396
A fat dowry can cover up for it.

168
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,802
Don't worry. I'll arrange for it.

169
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:38,323
No, I can't let him spend on
Siddhi's wedding.

170
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:43,015
May the groom be rich or poor,
she isn't getting married.

171
00:16:24,014 --> 00:16:26,878
Mr. Gupta, think again.

172
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:29,088
You're dealing with me

173
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:31,993
by calling off a contract
with Agra's biggest businessman.

174
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,514
I hope, you won't have
a change of mind later.

175
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:38,669
Weak people alter their intentions.

176
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:45,314
Neither do I fear Jaya Creations
nor Mrs. Jaya Pandey.

177
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:30,375
That mother-son duo is very zealous.

178
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:37,222
Soon, we'll erase their company's name
from Agra's market.

179
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,014
It's difficult.

180
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:52,611
My mom says,
"If a trader tries to be dishonest

181
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:55,125
then he should be prepared to get beaten."

182
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:11,414
What is this?

183
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:12,601
A beating.

184
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:15,823
I've got news for you two.

185
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,396
All shareholders of your companies
have sold their shares to Jaya Creations.

186
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:27,221
Yes, I did have to pay double the price.

187
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,626
But I had to teach you a lesson.

188
00:18:31,198 --> 00:18:32,499
Please spare us.

189
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:37,634
We will be doomed. Please forgive us.

190
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,316
The word 'Forgiveness' doesn't exist
in Vinayak Pandey's dictionary.

191
00:18:45,305 --> 00:18:47,511
My company is named after my mom.

192
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,114
Jaya Pandey.

193
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:55,404
Our friends and foes know
the significance of her name very well.

194
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,128
Letters from a hermitage at Vrindavan.

195
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,709
You may spend
the rest of your lives in peace there.

196
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,133
He is so arrogant!

197
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:39,310
Watch it, soon someone will
bring him down to his senses.

198
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:43,397
Love can transform anyone.

199
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:49,603
This order has to be delivered on time.

200
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:51,882
As the payment will be made in cash.

201
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:56,421
I have to buy dad's medicines
and take Maya shopping.

202
00:19:58,095 --> 00:20:04,016
First, the spices,
then onions, next are tomatoes

203
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:07,325
chilli and then lemon.

204
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,261
Oh, no, Maya has curdled the milk.

205
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:33,523
Stop crying, Maya. It's okay.

206
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:35,801
It's okay.

207
00:20:36,188 --> 00:20:38,720
Why yell for a petty thing?

208
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,600
Petty! It's impossible
to find so much of milk before evening.

209
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:51,556
Are the sweets ready? It should be
delivered within half an hour.

210
00:20:58,704 --> 00:21:01,316
Sweets should be delivered
in half an hour?

211
00:21:01,504 --> 00:21:03,014
Yeah, sure.

212
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,812
Ma'am, you'll have to cancel the order.

213
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:10,423
Will you really have to cancel the order?

214
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:13,006
Not at all. I won't do that.

215
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:14,615
How do you plan to make sweets now?

216
00:21:23,102 --> 00:21:25,142
I may not be able
to make his favourite sweets

217
00:21:25,713 --> 00:21:28,825
but we can surely make Rasgullas
using curdled milk, Jhumki.

218
00:21:31,214 --> 00:21:34,923
I'll make lip-smacking ones for him.

219
00:21:37,105 --> 00:21:38,184
Hold on.

220
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:08,977
And it's done.
We'll quickly go shopping for Maya.

221
00:22:09,057 --> 00:22:10,212
And be back in a jiffy.

222
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,106
What do you want?

223
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:16,527
The property deeds.

224
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:22,026
Why do you want them?

225
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:26,717
I'll have to arrange money
for Siddhi's wedding.

226
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:31,418
Mr. Verma has agreed to mortgage
our house at a low interest rate.

227
00:22:31,498 --> 00:22:33,649
What's wrong with you?

228
00:22:34,034 --> 00:22:36,224
You are overlooking
Maya in favour of Siddhi.

229
00:22:37,447 --> 00:22:39,398
This house is all that we have.

230
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:43,715
If that is mortgaged,
will anything be left for Maya?

231
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,711
Don't worry, I'll manage everything.

232
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,677
Focus on Siddhi's wedding.

233
00:22:58,974 --> 00:23:01,771
No, the wedding can't take place.

234
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:09,171
I'll put up a big act for Siddhi
to rethink about Maya before marrying.

235
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:15,112
You bought such nice stuff for me, Siddhi.

236
00:23:15,615 --> 00:23:16,932
You are very nice.

237
00:23:18,426 --> 00:23:20,868
What plans for my birthday?

238
00:23:20,948 --> 00:23:24,123
It will be loads of fun.

239
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,440
Wait.

240
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,377
Hello.

241
00:24:11,113 --> 00:24:12,120
Maya!

242
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:22,227
Maya, are you okay?

243
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:24,100
Hope you didn't get hurt.

244
00:24:26,918 --> 00:24:27,925
No.

245
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,534
Does anyone stroll
in the middle of the road?

246
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:36,224
Maybe you can't see, mister.

247
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:39,510
It's a no entry lane.

248
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:44,938
You were driving rashly
in a crowded street!

249
00:24:45,202 --> 00:24:46,297
Don't you feel ashamed?

250
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:56,670
Well, whoever she is,
was walking in the middle of the road.

251
00:24:57,123 --> 00:24:58,516
She seems to be crazy.

252
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:22,513
Don't you dare call my sister crazy!

253
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,592
She isn't crazy

254
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:30,604
but rich boys like you are who don't
follow the rules while driving fancy cars.

255
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:32,509
What if my sister would have got harmed?

256
00:25:34,808 --> 00:25:39,517
Stop staring,
be decent and apologise to her.

257
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,429
I guess, you don't know who I am.

258
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:44,104
I'm Vinayak Pandey.

259
00:25:44,902 --> 00:25:46,414
Owner of Jaya Creations.

260
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:49,216
So? Agra isn't yours alone.

261
00:25:51,317 --> 00:25:54,285
Look, you scared her.

262
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,485
Come on, apologise to her.

263
00:26:02,846 --> 00:26:08,406
Fine, if she is hurt, take some money

264
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,999
and get her treated. Stop this drama

265
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:12,203
and get out of here.

266
00:26:34,811 --> 00:26:35,975
What the heck!

267
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:37,497
You must apologise.

268
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:40,427
Or else, you can't leave from here.

269
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:47,216
How arrogant can the rich be!

270
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:51,768
They can't mow down people.

271
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:54,888
He must apologise.

272
00:26:56,025 --> 00:26:58,716
Yes, he must.
It's the right thing to do.

273
00:26:58,804 --> 00:27:02,575
Yes, he should.

274
00:27:05,913 --> 00:27:06,929
I'm sorry.

275
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:18,413
Don't you ever do this to anyone else.

276
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,105
Get in.

277
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:09,517
Mom, don't take her away,
I've got to give her the pills.

278
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:14,136
Mom!

279
00:28:14,311 --> 00:28:18,171
Mom, what happened? Please tell me.

280
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:19,517
Where are you taking Maya?

281
00:28:20,207 --> 00:28:22,690
Don't worry, Maya.
Please tell me. What's wrong?

282
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:24,878
What are you going to do?

283
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:26,739
- No, Mom!
- Siddhi!

284
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:28,626
Mom, don't do this.

285
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,539
- Mom, no!
- No!

286
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:36,418
Reluctantly, I'll have to enact this
to instil fear in Siddhi's mind.

287
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:40,075
And manipulate her into obeying my wishes.

288
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:41,440
What are you doing?

289
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,796
I'm going to kill her today.

290
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,415
- No, Mom.
- No!

291
00:28:44,495 --> 00:28:45,527
What are you doing, Mom!

292
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:46,885
Don't worry, Maya.

293
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:48,329
How long will you save her?

294
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:50,710
You will leave after the wedding.

295
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:53,101
For how long will I take care of her?

296
00:28:53,402 --> 00:28:56,116
It's better to push her in the well
and end the matter.

297
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,116
Save me, sister!

298
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,831
- Maya!
- Maya!

299
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:37,820
[Sanskrit chant]

300
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:45,220
[Sanskrit chant]

301
00:30:00,893 --> 00:30:02,816
My Maya got saved in the nick of time.

302
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,816
Thank God.

303
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,014
What had gotten into you?

304
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,323
Does anyone ever do this to her child?

305
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:19,208
What else could I do?

306
00:30:21,396 --> 00:30:25,307
Your dad is adamant on marrying you off
and sending you away.

307
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:29,868
He is thinking of mortgaging the house.

308
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:34,990
Being homeless, where will I take Maya?

309
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,688
Answer me.

310
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:39,138
You don't have to worry about Maya.

311
00:30:40,997 --> 00:30:44,600
I've always taken care of her
and will do so in the future too.

312
00:30:45,604 --> 00:30:46,707
But how, Siddhi?

313
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:49,135
You'll be married and gone.

314
00:30:51,202 --> 00:30:52,797
How will Maya survive then?

315
00:30:54,514 --> 00:30:57,013
Mom, Maya has always been
my responsibility.

316
00:30:57,394 --> 00:31:00,219
And it will be the same
even after I get married.

317
00:31:06,014 --> 00:31:10,823
I'll only marry the one
who accepts this condition.

318
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,907
Otherwise, I'll remain unmarried forever.

319
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:24,129
I'll never let Maya be sad.

320
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:27,318
Even if it calls for a sacrifice.
