00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,113
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,113 --> 00:00:02,775
What is the mystery of the Taj Mahal?

3
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:07,202
What's hiding behind the 22 closed doors of the Taj Mahal?

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,972
Some people claim that idols of Hindu Gods are hidden behind them.

5
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:14,944
On the other hand, some say that they are hiding the fabled good days.

6
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:18,000
The first door hiding cheap petrol and diesel,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,804
the second hiding employment opportunities,

8
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:25,186
Some people have gone further and said that the Taj Mahal is actually a Shiv Temple,

9
00:00:25,186 --> 00:00:27,776
whose real name is Tejo Mahalaya.

10
00:00:27,776 --> 00:00:31,093
According to a theory, it wasn't built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan,

11
00:00:31,093 --> 00:00:34,921
rather it was built by Raja Paramardi Dev,

12
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:36,240
in the 13th century.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,072
After that, it was passed down to Raja Maan Singh,

14
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,836
and Shah Jahan bought the Taj Mahal

15
00:00:41,836 --> 00:00:44,493
from his grandson, Raja Jai Singh.

16
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:47,716
Another popular theory about the Taj Mahal is that

17
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:52,194
Shah Jahan had chopped off the hands of 20,000 labourers,

18
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:53,503
after building the Taj Mahal,

19
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:57,146
so the workers who worked on the Taj Mahal,

20
00:00:57,146 --> 00:01:00,307
couldn't build any other monument as beautiful as it.

21
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:03,470
In one theory, the Tejo Mahalaya was built in the 13th century.

22
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,893
In the other, Shah Jahan had chopped off the hands of the workers in the 17th century,

23
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:09,101
about 450 years later.

24
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:11,456
So both theories cannot be true.

25
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:14,787
So in today's video, come let's try to find out the truth.

26
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:16,849
What is the history of the Taj Mahal?

27
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:19,127
How much truth do these theories hold?

28
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:22,409
And what's hidden behind the 22 closed doors of the Taj Mahal?

29
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,199
"The 7th Wonder of the World,
a symbol of love."

30
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:28,953
"It's said that history is based on facts and not on emotions."

31
00:01:28,953 --> 00:01:32,473
"What history? Whose history?
Whose version of history?"

32
00:01:32,473 --> 00:01:36,654
"BJP government demands the 22 closed doors of the Taj Mahal be reopened."

33
00:01:36,654 --> 00:01:40,361
"And the judges have slammed the Taj Mahal petitioner."

34
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:44,780
Friends, let's understand the real history of the Taj Mahal first.

35
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,331
Shah Jahan and Mumtaz.

36
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:47,633
What were their real names?

37
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:51,025
Shah Jahan was born on 5th January 1592,

38
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:52,691
his real name was Khurram.

39
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:54,746
Shah Jahan, was the royal name

40
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:56,309
which was bestowed on him later,

41
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:57,725
literally meaning 'the King of the World'.

42
00:01:57,725 --> 00:01:58,816
Shah Jahan.

43
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:02,093
His father was Jahangir and
his mother was Jagat Gosain.

44
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:04,127
The chief queen of Jahangir.

45
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:07,924
Mumtaz Mahal was born in 1593.

46
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:11,649
The name Mumtaz Mahal was bestowed on her after her wedding.

47
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:14,523
Her real name was Arjumand Banu Begum.

48
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:18,352
Khurram and Mumtaz were engaged in 1907,

49
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:21,235
and they were married in 1612.

50
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:23,462
Shah Jahan had other wives as well.

51
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:26,431
Including Qandahari Mahal
and Akbarabadi Mahal.

52
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:28,228
But according to court historians,

53
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:31,894
these marriages were based on political alliances.

54
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:34,361
Various historical accounts tell us that

55
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:37,443
Shah Jahan's relationship with his other wives,

56
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:39,639
were marriages only in name.

57
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:43,098
They were simply to maintain political alliances.

58
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:46,689
Shah Jahan's affection and love for Mumtaz

59
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:50,430
was much more than that for his other wives.

60
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,142
this is why she was given more favours.

61
00:02:53,142 --> 00:02:55,048
Such as the title of Malika-i-Jahan.

62
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:56,612
The Queen of the World.

63
00:02:56,612 --> 00:02:58,832
Her palace, Khas Mahal,

64
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:02,646
was said to have been decorated with pure gold and precious stones.

65
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:04,178
According to historical records,

66
00:03:04,178 --> 00:03:06,707
Mumtaz showed great interest in administration as well.

67
00:03:06,707 --> 00:03:09,831
So when Shah Jahan went for diplomatic negotiations,

68
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:11,051
or for war,

69
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:13,262
Mumtaz always accompanied him.

70
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:17,772
Shah Jahan had exactly one child with all his other wives,

71
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:21,105
with Mumtaz Mahal, he had 14 children.

72
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:23,575
Half of the children died during childbirth.

73
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:25,587
This used to be much more common back then.

74
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:27,303
The healthcare system used to be terrible.

75
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:31,698
Unfortunately, Mumtaz died while giving birth to their 14th child.

76
00:03:31,698 --> 00:03:35,353
It happened on 17th June 1631.

77
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:39,884
The cause of death is said to be postpartum haemorrhage.

78
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:41,294
Loss of blood.

79
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:44,645
After her death, Shah Jahan went into deep grief.

80
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:46,415
He was paralysed with grief.

81
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:48,692
He cried for days and weeks on end.

82
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:53,620
And it is said that he was in isolation for a year mourning the death of his wife.

83
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,448
When he appeared again, it's said that his hair had turned white.

84
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:57,789
His back was bent

85
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:59,605
and his face showed his despair.

86
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:01,681
In Islamic theology, it is believed that

87
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:04,542
the body of the deceased turns into soil.

88
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:07,647
but the soul remains in the grave.

89
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:11,022
Later, on Judgement Day, the souls will return to the Creator,

90
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:13,086
when it'll be decided if the soul would go to heaven or hell.

91
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:18,027
So the grave is known as the final resting place of a soul.

92
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:22,105
Shah Jahan believed that the final resting place of Mumtaz Mahal,

93
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:23,753
should be grand.

94
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:24,858
Unparalleled.

95
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:27,000
When he decided to build the Taj Mahal,

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,413
the Chief Architect was Ustad Ahmad Lahori,

97
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:32,339
was bestowed the title 'Nadir-e-Asr'.

98
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,841
The Wonder of the Age.

99
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,673
The calligraphy on the white marble panels,

100
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:38,934
was done by Abdul Haq Shirazi.

101
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:41,116
More than 1,000 elephants were used

102
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:43,232
for transporting the building materials.

103
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:45,799
The white marble was brought in from Rajasthan,

104
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,166
Jasper from Punjab,

105
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,130
Jade and Crystal from China,

106
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,512
Turquoise from Tibet,

107
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:51,966
Sapphire from Sri Lanka,

108
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:53,997
And Carnelian from Arabia.

109
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:57,091
The gems and materials that can be found in the Taj Mahal,

110
00:04:57,091 --> 00:04:58,557
have come from all over the world.

111
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:01,538
In total, it took 22 years to build the Taj Mahal.

112
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,155
For its construction and decoration.

113
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:05,875
Approximately 22,000 labourers

114
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,277
worked on it every day for 22 years.

115
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:11,827
Friends, the history of controversies about the Taj Mahal has been long.

116
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:15,694
But let's begin our story with the most recent controversy.

117
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,753
The recent controversy began with the news

118
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,782
that BJP politician Rajneesh Singh

119
00:05:20,782 --> 00:05:23,208
had filed a petition in Allahabad High Court,

120
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,632
that the 22 closed rooms of the Taj Mahal should be opened.

121
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:30,450
He wanted ASI, the Archaeological Survey of India,

122
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,017
to set up a special committee

123
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:34,899
to look into the 22 closed rooms.

124
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:39,899
And would investigate if there are any idols of Hindu Gods in there.

125
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,954
This petition held that

126
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:45,483
there were claims that the Taj Mahal is actually a Hindu Temple,

127
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:46,848
called Tejo Mahalaya,

128
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:50,191
and that it was the duty of the court to direct the opening of the closed doors,

129
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:52,385
under the Freedom of Information.

130
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,746
But this petition was dismissed by the court.

131
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:56,238
the bench of judges said that

132
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:58,080
by filing such petitions,

133
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,262
the PIL system was being mocked.

134
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:03,218
The court asked for the basis of the petition.

135
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:06,669
Whether any legal or constitutional rights were being infringed here.

136
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:08,664
If not, what were the grounds for the petition?

137
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:11,309
Historical research is handled by historians,

138
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:13,577
and for that proper methodology needs to be followed.

139
00:06:13,577 --> 00:06:16,701
But friends, if you think that after the dismissal of this petition

140
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:18,000
the secret would always remain a secret,

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,593
don't fret.

142
00:06:19,593 --> 00:06:22,241
In this video, I'll tell you the secret hidden behind the locked doors.

143
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,000
Friends, the thing is that

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,489
ASI sources have already told the Indian Express,

145
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:30,777
that these 22 'rooms' aren't rooms really.

146
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:33,230
It's actually a long corridor

147
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,592
with doors on its side.

148
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:38,359
And the locked doors in question haven't always been locked.

149
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:40,766
According to the source, the ASI staff

150
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:46,054
clean out the corridor each week or in a couple of weeks.

151
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:47,917
A retired ASI official has said that

152
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:49,650
there's nothing on the walls.

153
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,927
To have such rooms in the basement is not unusual for Mughal monuments.

154
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:57,941
The Humayun's Tomb in Delhi, 
and the Safdarjung Tomb,

155
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:01,371
both have similar underground rooms in the basement.

156
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:03,329
They make up a corridor

157
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:05,856
and act as the structural element

158
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:07,881
on which the monument rests.

159
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,003
Another retired ASI official revealed that

160
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:12,157
the area was cordoned off

161
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:14,385
because there was nothing for the tourists to see.

162
00:07:14,385 --> 00:07:16,574
If they are kept open unnecessarily,

163
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:18,147
there would be a crowd there.

164
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:22,318
So to preserve the monument, the areas have been locked.

165
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:25,378
After all, the Taj Mahal is a protected World Heritage Site

166
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,165
with more than 100,000 visitors every day.

167
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:29,605
So with so many people constantly passing through,

168
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:32,222
they wanted to avoid the wear and tear and protect the monument.

169
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:34,011
Even after the petition was dismissed,

170
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,317
after ASI officials explained things,

171
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:37,984
the debate didn't stop.

172
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:42,192
Some people in the media and social media kept this debate on unreasonably.

173
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:44,868
It seemed almost like someone was benefiting from this,

174
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:46,146
by discussing these things.

175
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:48,096
So after about 3 or 4 days,

176
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:50,042
the Archaeological Survey of India,

177
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:52,638
tried to end this debate forever

178
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,535
by releasing pictures.

179
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:57,953
They publicly shared photos of the closed rooms.

180
00:07:57,953 --> 00:08:00,800
They showed the restoration work going on,

181
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,264
and what the rooms looked like from the inside.

182
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:06,590
Agra's ASI Chief R. K. Patel told India Today,

183
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,948
that the pictures can be found live on the website of ASI.

184
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,899
And that it was a part of their newsletter

185
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:14,473
and anyone can see the pictures by going to their website.

186
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:16,571
There was one thing noteworthy in these photos,

187
00:08:16,984 --> 00:08:20,003
and it was the hard work of the ASI staff,

188
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:21,926
for the conservation of our monuments.

189
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:24,368
You can see the before and after pictures here

190
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:26,721
before and after the restoration works.

191
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,337
It is only due to them,

192
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:31,703
that our historical gems continue to be preserved like so.

193
00:08:31,703 --> 00:08:34,221
Friends, this wasn't the first time that such claims were made.

194
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:37,342
There were several similar petitions before this as well.

195
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,082
Such as in April 2015,

196
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:42,094
a similar suit was filed in the Agra court by six lawyers,

197
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:45,121
who claimed that the Taj Mahal was actually a Shiv Temple.

198
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:47,024
They asked the court for permission

199
00:08:47,024 --> 00:08:49,698
to allow Hindus to worship there.

200
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:53,111
In their plea, lawyer Hari Shankar Jain and his colleagues said that

201
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:58,984
that it was Raja Paramardi Dev who built Tejo Mahalaya, in 1212 AD.

202
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:03,287
And that this temple was later inherited by Raja Maan Singh in the 17th century.

203
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:06,689
After which the property was held by Raja Jai Singh

204
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:10,695
and then in 1632, Shah Jahan annexed it.

205
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:12,860
After the death of Mumtaz Mahal,

206
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,379
after the death of Shah Jahan's wife,

207
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:18,126
this temple was converted into a memorial for Mumtaz.

208
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:20,726
Then the court directed the Central Government,

209
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,219
Union Ministry of Culture,

210
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:24,268
Home Secretary, and the ASI,

211
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:27,453
to submit their replies to this claim.

212
00:09:27,453 --> 00:09:31,358
In the reply, the government denied this possibility.

213
00:09:31,358 --> 00:09:35,039
In November 2015, the Union Cultural Minister Mahesh Sharma,

214
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,096
told the Lok Sabha that the government found no evidence

215
00:09:38,096 --> 00:09:40,463
that the Taj Mahal was a Hindu Temple.

216
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:41,934
The ASI said the same thing.

217
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:44,545
In 2017, the Archaeological Survey of India had said

218
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:46,990
that the Taj Mahal is a tomb, not a temple.

219
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,408
This is quite different from the Gyanvapi Masjid controversy.

220
00:09:50,408 --> 00:09:53,349
because there's actually proof

221
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:54,928
that there was once a temple.

222
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,876
But let's discuss that controversy in some other video,

223
00:09:57,876 --> 00:10:00,417
and let's focus on the Taj Mahal in this video.

224
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:03,394
They clarified the story about Raja Jai Singh,

225
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,448
and said that the land was annexed from him,

226
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:07,849
instead, it was given by him in exchange.

227
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:09,793
It has an interesting history behind it, friends.

228
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:13,259
In 2017, historian Rana Safi had written a blog,

229
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:14,691
on the DailyO platform,

230
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:16,912
a blogging platform of the India Today group.

231
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:21,255
In it, she wrote that Mughals were very interested in keeping a record of history.

232
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:24,586
Many Mughal Emperors had written autobiographies

233
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:26,065
they wrote in journals.

234
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:28,445
Such as Jahangirnama written by Jahangir.

235
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:32,187
Additionally, they even had the official history written down by court historians.

236
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:34,695
For example, during Akbar's reign,

237
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:36,941
Abu'l-Fazl had kept a record of history.

238
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:39,710
Apart from these, there were other accounts of history

239
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,189
written by other people of the era.

240
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:44,307
These are known as Contemporary Accounts.

241
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:46,929
These contemporary texts were compiled by

242
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:48,833
W. E.  Begley and Z. A. Desai

243
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,834
in their book Taj Mahal: The Illumined Tomb.

244
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,890
The various sources of that time

245
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,171
were compiled together so that we can see them in that context

246
00:10:56,171 --> 00:11:00,099
and get to know the detailed history of the Taj Mahal.

247
00:11:00,099 --> 00:11:02,237
How the Taj Mahal was built.

248
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:03,726
What were the methods used back then?

249
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:06,557
All of it has been documented beautifully. 

250
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:10,985
Raja Jai Singh had friendly relations with Shah Jahan. 

251
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:14,853
We get to know that Raja Jai Singh used to live in the area

252
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:16,235
where the Taj Mahal is built.

253
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:22,325
That place has been referred to in multiple sources as 'Haveli', 'Khana', and 'Manzil'.

254
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:25,485
Different sources use different words.

255
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,595
But these words were used to mean home.

256
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:30,923
Small or big, Raja Jai Singh's home was there.

257
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:34,918
Raja Jai Singh actually wanted to donate his land for free,

258
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:36,674
to build the tomb for the Emperess.

259
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:38,915
Historian Ira Mukhtoy tells us,

260
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:41,607
that this is because the royals of Jaipur,

261
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:43,584
had close relations to the Mughals

262
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:47,322
after Akbar's marriage to Amer's Harka Bai.

263
00:11:47,322 --> 00:11:49,363
Bollywood films will have us believe that

264
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:51,557
Akbar's wife's name was Jodha Bai.

265
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:53,482
As shown in the picture Jodha Akbar,

266
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:57,158
A good film, but in this instance, historically incorrect.

267
00:11:57,158 --> 00:12:00,306
Jodha Bai literally means a Lady from Jodhpur.

268
00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:02,290
But it was Jahangir,

269
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,328
who had married the daughter of Jodhpur's ruler, Raja Uday Singh.

270
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:08,577
His daughter was Jagat Gosain.

271
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:10,975
She was Shah Jahan's mother.

272
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:14,529
Back then, a British East India Company officer,

273
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:16,289
Lt Col James Todd,

274
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:20,506
wrote a book Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan.

275
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,075
In that book, he had mistakenly mentioned

276
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,163
Jodha Bai instead of Harka Bai.

277
00:12:25,163 --> 00:12:27,122
That's why people have this confusion

278
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,346
that Jodha Bai was Akbar's wife.

279
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:31,487
Akbar's wife was Harka Bai,

280
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:34,011
she was Raja Maan Singh's aunt.

281
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:36,645
And Raja Maan Singh was the trusted general of Akbar.

282
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:38,562
Shah Jahan was Akbar's grandson,

283
00:12:38,562 --> 00:12:41,082
and Raja Jai Singh was Raja Maan Singh's grandson.

284
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:45,042
You can now understand why the two had such close relations.

285
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:46,726
Raja Jai Singh and Shah Jahan.

286
00:12:46,726 --> 00:12:50,230
This is why Raja Jai Singh offered his land for free

287
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,205
he wanted to donate it to Shah Jahan,

288
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,087
so that Shah Jahan could build a tomb for Mumtaz.

289
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:59,242
But despite his offer, Shah Jahan didn't accept the offer of the land for free.

290
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:03,405
In exchange, Shah Jahan gave four palaces to Raja Jai Singh.

291
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:08,225
This transaction has been recorded in official papers as well,

292
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:10,571
and it was dated as it happened

293
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:12,950
28th December 1633.

294
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,000
You can see this record in Jaipur's City Palace now.

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,956
Historian Rana Safi uploaded a copy of it with translation on Twitter.

296
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:24,758
Friends, if you find the history of this era quite interesting, 

297
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:28,108
I'd like to recommend an audiobook on KUKU FM,

298
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,944
on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

299
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:33,975
In this audiobook, you get to know the details of the Maratha empire,

300
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:37,508
their expansion, and the way they defeated Mughals,

301
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:40,441
you can listen to it in an interesting format.

302
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:42,306
KUKU FM is an audio learning platform.

303
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:44,331
on it, you can listen to many such audiobooks,

304
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:47,180
books on history, and motivational books,

305
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,246
Normally, it costs ₹399 per year.

306
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,187
but since they have sponsored this video,

307
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:53,707
there's a special discount for you.

308
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:57,578
You will get 50% off when you use the coupon code DHRUV50.

309
00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:02,103
So the cost for the annual subscription to KUKU FM will cost you ₹199.

310
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:06,116
Only ₹199 to access their entire library for a year.

311
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:07,843
The link to it is in the description below.

312
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:09,250
Go check it out.

313
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,777
And now let's get back to the topic.

314
00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:13,387
But who spread the lies?

315
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,863
That Raja Jai Singh had a temple there

316
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:18,224
which was then forcefully taken away by Shah Jahan?

317
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,431
The existence of Tejo Mahalaya, a Shiv Temple,

318
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:23,533
is not supported by any evidence.

319
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:25,910
But the lies must have come from somewhere.

320
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,655
That are now being repeated everywhere.

321
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:30,185
The answer to this, friends, is one person,

322
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:32,161
Purushottam Nagesh Oak,

323
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:34,475
also known as P.N. Oak.

324
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:38,237
He was the person who came up with the claim of Tejo Mahalaya.

325
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:40,769
Interestingly, he was not a historian.

326
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:42,348
He was a history enthusiast,

327
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,380
and enjoyed writing history as well.

328
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,653
But he wasn't a historian

329
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:47,794
because he made up his version of history.

330
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,536
He rewrote history.

331
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:52,105
Friends, the methodology of historians

332
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:54,278
is extensive and tiring.

333
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:57,740
A historian has to look through old newspapers and magazines,

334
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,724
diary entries, letters,

335
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:04,220
painting, historical accounts of court historians,

336
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,340
accounts of contemporary historians,

337
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,117
accounts of travellers, carbon dating,

338
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:12,672
and then they have to analyse them to understand

339
00:15:12,672 --> 00:15:14,635
what would have happened back then.

340
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:17,716
After they've understood it, they have to write it down,

341
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,629
and create an account by citing the various sources they've relied on.

342
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,669
Then their writing is peer-reviewed,

343
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:26,461
by other historians,

344
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:28,723
to check how accurate

345
00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:30,989
the account written by the historian.

346
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:33,679
But P.N. Oak's methodology was vastly different from it.

347
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,336
The methodology he used worked somewhat like this.

348
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:39,726
Since the word Vatican sounds similar to the Sanskrit word 'Vatika',

349
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:43,506
he'd write that it was probable that Vatican had once been a Hindu temple.

350
00:15:43,506 --> 00:15:46,328
He didn't stop at 'probable', he wrote it as if that was the truth.

351
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,766
Westminster Abbey was also a Hindu temple,

352
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:50,519
And I'm not joking, guys.

353
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,288
These were the things written by P.N. Oak in his pamphlets.

354
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,721
If you think these sound weird,

355
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:58,809
he has written things way weirder than these.

356
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:01,294
He had written a pamphlet on Christianity.

357
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,600
He said that Christianity is actually Chrisn-Nity. [ideology of Hindu deity Krishna]

358
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,020
According to him, Jesus Christ had visited India,

359
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,512
between the ages of 13 and 30 years old,

360
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:11,987
and he had learned Krishna's ideologies here.

361
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:13,920
And so the entirety of Christianity

362
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,737
is therefore inspired by Hinduism.

363
00:16:15,737 --> 00:16:17,538
Not only this, but he also claimed that

364
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:21,289
Islam and Judaism too have come from Hinduism.

365
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:22,710
How?

366
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,987
Because Abraham sounds like Brahma.

367
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:27,722
Abraham's wife Sarah,

368
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:28,949
was probably Saraswati,

369
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:31,474
Moses would be Mahesh aka Shiv.

370
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:35,592
In fact, according to him, the entire world was ruled by an ancient Hindu empire.

371
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:37,315
Coming back to the topic of the Taj Mahal,

372
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:42,092
it was P.N. Oak who created this conspiracy theory about the Taj Mahal.

373
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:45,104
In his opinion, the Mughals didn't build any monuments.

374
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:49,505
Initially, P.N. Oak said that the Taj Mahal was a wonder of ancient Hinduism,

375
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:50,991
built in ancient times.

376
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:55,649
The historians refuted this by saying that buildings from before the 4th century

377
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:58,758
have only survived is they were made by cutting out rocks.

378
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:00,802
No other buildings have survived.

379
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:02,292
So this couldn't be possible.

380
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:04,577
The Taj Mahal was actually built in the 1600s.

381
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:07,138
After this, Oak revised his claim.

382
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:11,314
Then he said that it was built in the year 1155,

383
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:13,144
by Raja Paramardi Dev.

384
00:17:13,144 --> 00:17:15,444
By the Chief Minister of the Raja Dev.

385
00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:19,079
When history is so close to home, it doesn't take long to be revised.

386
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,010
In 1989, he wrote another pamphlet titled

387
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,987
Taj Mahal: The True Story.

388
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:26,759
On the basis of his own pamphlet,

389
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,840
he filed a PIL in the court in 2000 saying that

390
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,011
we need to know the truth behind it.

391
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:34,724
Interestingly, in court, he had also cited that

392
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:37,231
Shah Jahan had acquired Raja Jai Singh's palace.

393
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:39,621
So he took one line from actual history,

394
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:43,906
and the remaining part was fabricated by him with an active imagination.

395
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:48,295
To be honest, P.N. Oak could have been a brilliant fiction author.

396
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:53,425
But for some reason, he chose to be a self-proclaimed historian.

397
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:56,089
Supreme Court had dismissed his petition saying that

398
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:58,027
it was a misconceived notion,

399
00:17:58,027 --> 00:18:00,346
the Supreme Court had even ridiculed him,

400
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,790
saying that it seemed he was bitten by a bee.

401
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,776
And so we arrive at 2010.

402
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:06,252
WhatsApp started gaining traction.

403
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,693
The WhatsApp University began.

404
00:18:08,693 --> 00:18:12,302
And the fictional tales of P.N. Oak,

405
00:18:12,302 --> 00:18:15,202
turn into theories of the WhatsApp University.

406
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:18,881
When these fictional stories are forwarded time and again,

407
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:19,884
and reach people.

408
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:22,865
People start believing them to be true accounts,

409
00:18:22,865 --> 00:18:26,224
and then there are fresh petitions put to our courts.

410
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:28,520
And then our courts have to waste their time on such futile petitions.

411
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,140
Interestingly, after being forwarded so many times in WhatsApp University,

412
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,657
P.N. Oak had talked about the year 1155,

413
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,111
but in the latest petition filed in the court,

414
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,749
the petitioner claimed that it was built in the year 1212.

415
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:46,010
"The petition talks about the history of the Taj Mahal as well.

416
00:18:46,264 --> 00:18:52,912
According to it, Raja Paramardi Dev had built Tejo Mahalaya in 1212."

417
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:54,464
But what difference does it make?

418
00:18:54,464 --> 00:18:58,151
These fake theories now become topics for extended debates on TV.

419
00:18:58,151 --> 00:19:00,452
And then the people on TV debate as if

420
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:03,257
this is a huge mystery.

421
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:05,274
As if we don't know what the truth is.

422
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:07,922
When the entire truth has been repeated time and time again.

423
00:19:07,922 --> 00:19:11,012
Another famous claim about Shah Jahan is that

424
00:19:11,012 --> 00:19:14,364
Shah Jahan had chopped off the hands of the workers,

425
00:19:14,364 --> 00:19:15,753
after the Taj Mahal was built.

426
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:18,446
So that they couldn't build another monument like the Taj Mahal.

427
00:19:18,446 --> 00:19:21,355
Our Union Agricultural Minister, Narendra Singh Tomar,

428
00:19:21,355 --> 00:19:23,306
had repeated this claim last year,

429
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:24,640
saying that

430
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,544
"the Taj Mahal was built in Agra,

431
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:28,750
and the workers who built it,

432
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,848
had their hands chopped off.

433
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:35,019
But the workers working on the Vishwanath Corridor,

434
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:38,948
will be welcomed with a petal shower

435
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:43,961
a new tradition was started in this country by PM Narendra Modi."

436
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:46,679
If you try to think about this claim logically,

437
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,103
you will wonder how it could have been possible.

438
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:52,784
The 20,000 workers who had built the Taj Mahal,

439
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:55,612
were their hands chopped off on the same day?

440
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,462
If not, were they asked to come in one by one,

441
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:00,821
you're they next one to get your hands chopped off.

442
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:02,469
And everyone stood in a queue waiting for their turn.

443
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:06,004
It wouldn't have been possible to cut off the hands of 20,000 people in a day,

444
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:10,376
So they had a list of names of the workers whose hands were to be chopped off that day,

445
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,242
and then they'd turn away those who were scheduled for another day.

446
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:14,958
Asking them to adhere to the schedule. 

447
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,581
If that happened, would the workers have waited in the queue

448
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:20,485
waiting for their turn to get the hands cut off?

449
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,090
Waiting in the queue for his turn.

450
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,009
As soon as they would have started cutting off their hands,

451
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:25,314
the others would have run away.

452
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:30,578
Obviously, there's zero evidence of it being true historically,

453
00:20:30,578 --> 00:20:31,749
Had this been true,

454
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:35,190
archaeologically, we would have found skeletal remains of the hands somewhere.

455
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,068
This would have been mentioned somewhere in some book.

456
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:41,340
Some court historians would have mentioned it.

457
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,495
There were several travellers there during that era from foreign countries,

458
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:46,187
they wrote books as well,

459
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:49,266
something would have been mentioned somewhere at least.

460
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:50,624
But there are no mentions of it.

461
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,619
In fact, the evidence that we have,

462
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,123
are contrary to this claim.

463
00:20:54,123 --> 00:20:56,249
Shah Jahan had built a huge settlement

464
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:57,331
known as Taj Ganj,

465
00:20:57,331 --> 00:20:59,031
it still exists today,

466
00:20:59,031 --> 00:21:01,847
thousands of masons, artisans, and workers

467
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:04,982
assembled there from different regions of the empire,

468
00:21:04,982 --> 00:21:06,445
to work on the Taj Mahal together.

469
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:09,695
The descendants of those workers,

470
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:13,213
still live there and work there,

471
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:15,445
and practice the skill of their forefathers.

472
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:18,328
Actually, after building the Taj Mahal,

473
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:22,986
Shah Jahan's workers built an entirely new city.

474
00:21:22,986 --> 00:21:25,162
It was named Shahjahanabad.

475
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:26,263
Later named Delhi.

476
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:27,821
So think about it logically,

477
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:29,670
the Taj Mahal, Red Fort, Jama Masjid,

478
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,644
were built around the same time.

479
00:21:31,644 --> 00:21:33,891
Had the hands of the workers being chopped off,

480
00:21:33,891 --> 00:21:36,759
how could the empire have built such enormous monuments?

481
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,981
Shah Jahan's period is believed to be

482
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:41,016
the Golden Period of Mughal Architecture,

483
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:42,629
it was possible only because

484
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:45,197
when Shah Jahan respected his workers.

485
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:46,872
Today, for many people,

486
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,949
the Taj Mahal is a symbol of Love.

487
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:51,629
Poets like Shakeel have written about it, describing it as

488
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:53,995
"An Emperor built the majestic Taj Mahal,

489
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:56,306
and gave the world a symbol of love."

490
00:21:56,306 --> 00:22:00,081
On the other hand, legendary poets like Sahir Ludhyanvi had written,

491
00:22:00,081 --> 00:22:02,323
"An Emperor created a display of wealth,

492
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:04,823
to ridicule the affection of the poor."

493
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,767
Irrespective of the version of the poem that is true,

494
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,551
today, it cannot be denied,

495
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:11,472
that the Taj Mahal is an architectural marvel.

496
00:22:11,472 --> 00:22:14,466
It is one of the official Seven Wonders of the World,

497
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,956
and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

498
00:22:16,956 --> 00:22:19,549
India's one of the most popular tourist attractions,

499
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:22,485
people from all around the world come to see it.

500
00:22:22,485 --> 00:22:24,904
There is no reason not to be proud of it,

501
00:22:24,904 --> 00:22:27,435
It is a gem of India in all aspects.

502
00:22:27,435 --> 00:22:28,634
If this was an informative video,

503
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:31,300
you can watch other history videos in this playlist

504
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,047
and the next time you see someone

505
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:37,292
whether in your WhatsApp groups, or your friend or family member,

506
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:39,835
repeating such baseless rumours about the Taj Mahal,

507
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:42,136
do share this video with them.

508
00:22:42,136 --> 00:22:43,519
Thank you very much!
