1
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,200
"Mr. White.. Mr. Black."

2
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,760
"Mr. White.. Mr. Black."

3
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:22,280
"Take it, sir.
There is no deal in love."

4
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,680
Brother..

5
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,280
What is it?

6
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,600
Brother, have you seen him anywhere?

7
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,520
Who is he?

8
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,040
He is Kishan, my brother.

9
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,440
Where does he live?

10
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,280
Here in Goa.

11
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,200
Even I will in Goa? - Is it?

12
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,200
Yes, what is his address?

13
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,120
Goa village.

14
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,000
Is that so? Can you see
the street from here? - Yes.

15
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,280
Take a right from there.
Take a left from there.

16
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,200
You'll get a circle there.
Take two to four rounds of that..

17
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,680
..circle, then ask anybody,
they'll tell you about him.

18
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
They'll tell you about him.
Is that clear?

19
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,040
"Take it, sir.
There is no deal in love."

20
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,600
Where will I search
for my Kishan now?

21
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,200
Hey run! Hey brother!

22
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,200
Whose dog is this, brother?

23
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,600
Hey brother! Somebody help me!

24
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,920
I am very scared of dogs!

25
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,440
Open! Open.

26
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,840
"Kohl eyed. Kohl eyed.."

27
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,000
Hey you! How can you
directly come in like that?

28
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,520
Shall I get down?

29
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,680
Hey! Wait there!
The meter is running. Don't leave.

30
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,280
"We got down.."

31
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,600
Brother, there is a dog.

32
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,680
If that dog had pulled
my wraparound, I would've..

33
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,440
..got embarrassed in public.
I found you, felt like I found God.

34
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Don't address me as God, I am Tulsi.
Who are you?

35
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,440
I am Gopi. I am looking for him.
Do you know him?

36
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,600
You are looking for him?

37
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,280
Who doesn't know him?
He is famous all over India.

38
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,520
By the way, who is he?
- What?

39
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,200
I meant.. nobody has
the guts to say who he is.

40
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,120
Yes. - He is our..

41
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Kishan.. - Yes, Kiran. - Kishan.

42
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,440
Are you deaf? I told the same thing,
Kishan. Kishan.

43
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,840
I'll call him right away. 922..

44
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Hey Kishan..
where are you? Where are you?

45
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,360
Brother, let me talk to him.

46
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,280
Where? Where? There!
Okay, one minute.. one minute..

47
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,600
Your brother is here.

48
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
Give it to me.

49
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,840
Here, talk to him.

50
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Hello!
- Where did you say you are?

51
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,760
Where did you say you are?
I'll get him there right away.

52
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,200
We've reached. We've reached.

53
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,440
Come, come.
Meet your brother. Radhe, come.

54
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,760
I am Gopi, Tulsi.

55
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,440
The same.. understand my feelings.

56
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,000
Do you see this building?

57
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,280
But, that's a hut.

58
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,600
You call that a building in English.

59
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
There is a ground
floor on the first floor.

60
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,040
There is a terrace on top of that.

61
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Your brother Akash must be there.

62
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,520
Kishan. - The same.. are you nuts?

63
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,840
Hey, why are you taking
this bag along with you?

64
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,440
First, go and meet your brother.

65
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,760
You first go and meet your brother.

66
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,360
Give this bag to this brother.
Come on, go and meet your brother.

67
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,960
Go. Go. Hurry up.

68
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,360
Kishan! - There is water..
be careful.

69
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,520
You'll get wet.

70
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,600
Hey Kishan!

71
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,000
Tulsi, here..

72
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,600
Hey thief! Thief! Police!

73
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,200
Brother, I've come all
the way from Hoshiarpur..

74
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,360
..searching for my brother.
Somebody stole my bag.

75
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,960
Who was he?
- Tulsi. That thief stole my bag.

76
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,920
Whose photograph is this?

77
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,440
I've come in search of him.

78
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,840
So, is he Tulsi?

79
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,360
He is Kishan.

80
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,600
Then who is Tulsi.

81
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,760
Tulsi is the thief.

82
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,000
Then who is he?

83
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,840
Sir, I've come all the
way from Hoshiarpur to take him.

84
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,120
Are you searching
for him or the thief?

85
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,600
I'll search for him and you
should search for the thief, right?

86
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,920
Why are you looking for him?

87
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,000
To take him back to Hoshiarpur.

88
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,600
So, he is a run-away
from Hoshiarpur.

89
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,760
He didn't run away from Hoshiarpur,
but walked..

90
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,920
..I came running behind him.

91
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,200
Tell me one thing,
all together how many men ran away?

92
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,360
Total? There was only one..
that Tulsi.

93
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
And you are looking for him?

94
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,760
I am searching this guy, Kishan.

95
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,680
And Tulsi?

96
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,000
He ran away with my luggage, right?
That thief!

97
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,120
This is a police station and
not the alleys of the village to..

98
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,360
..play hide and seek. You first
decide whom are you looking for.

99
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,120
You are very confused
and confusing me too.

100
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,520
Decide whether you have
to look for Tulsi or this Kishan!

101
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,840
Babu..

102
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,200
Police!

103
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,600
Hey!

104
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,600
Open the coat! Oh no!

105
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,760
If I press a button, you
all will shatter to pieces with me.

106
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,200
Why do you want to die?
Surrender yourself..

107
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,680
..I will appeal to the
court to reduce your punishment.

108
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,600
I don't want forgiveness. Leave.

109
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,120
Look Babu, don't take a wrong step.

110
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,680
Inspector, you can't convince me.

111
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,120
Please, don't press the button.
We will do as per your wishes.

112
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,360
Look, I'll keep this gun down.
Let them all leave from here.

113
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:50,920
Okay? Okay, I am keeping it.
Relax. Relax.

114
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,520
Move out from here! Out!

115
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,000
Come on! Get out!

116
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,280
This is mine,
this is Chhoti's, and..

117
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,280
This..

118
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,360
This is yours,
this is mine, and this.. Chhoti's.

119
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,280
Okay.

120
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,000
It means,
Chhoti's share equals ours.

121
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Your sister, Divya is very lucky.

122
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,840
You fool,
idiot, isn't she your sister too?

123
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,000
Look dude,
I was not destined to go to school.

124
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,120
I had a dream that
I would educate Divya.

125
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,600
I am trying to fulfill that.
What difference does it make if..

126
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,680
..I am doing some swindling for her?

127
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,440
I am not doing any robbery,
murder or fighting with anyone.

128
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,440
Just a bit of swindling.
That is acceptable.

129
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,600
Look, I was telling the truth.
The bell rang. Hey Divya!

130
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,680
You will live a very long life.

131
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,360
I was just talking about you.
Do you have any problem?

132
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,200
Brother, this is London.
Everything is fine.

133
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,520
I know. I know.

134
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,280
Listen, I've deposited
your fees money in the bank.

135
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,240
Manager said he would transfer it.

136
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,120
Strange, isn't it? Earlier
men used to get transferred and..

137
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,600
..nowadays it is money.
Our country has progressed.

138
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,120
Brother, will you continue
to talk about money or..

139
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
..talk about yourself too?

140
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,000
Dear, what do I
tell you about myself?

141
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,280
If you insist, let me tell you.

142
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,920
I've become a rich man here.
You remember people used..

143
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,360
..to buy gold chains in the
village.. I buy hotel chains here.

144
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,520
That's great, brother.

145
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,840
Thank you.

146
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,000
Listen, I hope you don't have any
problem with the food in the hostel?

147
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,280
If you have so, then tell me.
I'll send a lunch box from here.

148
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,120
Now enough, brother.
I am very proud of you.

149
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,000
Somebody has to learn from
you to see dreams and fulfill them.

150
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,600
Enough of talks now.
Concentrate on studies, okay?

151
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,840
Okay brother, take care. Bye.

152
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,200
Bye.

153
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,680
What is it?

154
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,120
Kishan, there is
a limit for everything.

155
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,120
Hotel chains? Sometimes
we don't have enough of money..

156
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,440
..to buy a cycle chain,
you are talking about hotel chains?

157
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,520
Somebody has to learn
how to charade from you.

158
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,120
Ladla! Don Ladla!

159
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,280
We've put him to rest.

160
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,720
What can he do when faced
with Teenie, Meenie and Zeenie?

161
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,280
At the most, he'll watch a Hindi
movie and weep in his mother's lap.

162
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,120
Your values and principles
can't provide a day's meal, Ravi.

163
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,920
What has your values and principles,
that you're willing to..

164
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
..risk your life for,
provided you with?

165
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,040
A low-wage cop's job,
an ordinary apartment..

166
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,360
..a pair of khaki uniforms,
and a govt. Jeep.

167
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,120
Look! Look at me! This is the
same me and this is the same you.

168
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,920
We've both started off
from this same footpath.

169
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,160
But look at where you stayed behind
and look at where I've reached.

170
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,040
Today, I own buildings,
properties, bank balance..

171
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,520
..bungalows, cars, what do you have?

172
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,760
I have my mother with me.

173
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,520
To hell with his mom!

174
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,920
I've been watching this
movie only till this scene..

175
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,600
..for the past 5 years.

176
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,600
Whenever the mom's dialogue comes,
he freezes the screen.

177
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,280
How much more?

178
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,440
Mom!

179
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,760
Son! - Mom!

180
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Son, freshen up fast,
I've cooked a sweet dish for you.

181
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,280
No, mother. Before that I
want to share a good news with you.

182
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,920
Have you brought
home my daughter-in-law?

183
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,040
No, mom.
It's a much bigger good news.

184
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,280
Today, your son has
become a don, mother.

185
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,440
I'm don. - Really?!

186
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,000
'I'm don, I'm don.'

187
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,200
'I'm.. I'm.. I'm don.'

188
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,360
Mother! You'll come back,
won't you, mother?

189
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,920
You'll feed me sweetmeats
with your own hands, won't you?

190
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,680
Don! Don! Don!

191
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,840
We've traced the girls.
We've received information that..

192
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,120
..they're in Goa.

193
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:59,120
"I love the beach.
I love the sand. I love the beauty."

194
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,760
"I love the pain. I love the rain."

195
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:11,760
"From here to there.
The ocean stretches. The ocean.."

196
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:19,840
"A fire burns somewhere
within my heart."

197
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,200
"It's a wet climate,
my love is young."

198
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,120
"It's a wet climate,
my love is young."

199
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,000
"My fantasies are full of fun."

200
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
"From here to there."

201
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,040
"From here to there."

202
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,040
"The ocean stretches. The ocean.."

203
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,760
"The ocean.."

204
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,600
"The ocean.."

205
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,760
"I love the beach. I love the sand.

206
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,760
I love the beauty."

207
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,800
"I love the pain. I love the rain."

208
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,520
"C'mon, let the music play."

209
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,280
"C'mon, let the time away."

210
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,480
"We've got the party going on."

211
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,280
"We're going to
rock the night away."

212
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,040
"Everybody feeling high."

213
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,120
"Reaching up to touch the sky."

214
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
"Come and get what
you want to, baby."

215
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,120
"Your chance is passing by."

216
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,920
"The crazy weather
is driving me crazy."

217
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,440
"It has filled my heart
with a fire of passion."

218
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,760
"The crazy weather
is driving me crazy."

219
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,520
"It has filled my heart
with a fire of passion."

220
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,680
"The moment is just right.
Even the air is intoxicated."

221
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,600
"The moment is just right.
Even the air is intoxicated."

222
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,680
"My fantasies are full of fun."

223
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,520
"The lightning of
love makes me restless."

224
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,760
"I feel like kissing
the fluttering lips."

225
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,520
"The lightning of
love makes me restless."

226
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,120
"I feel like kissing
the fluttering lips."

227
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,200
"It's a pleasant story.
There are no distances."

228
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,120
"It's a pleasant story.
There are no distances."

229
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,360
"My fantasies are full of fun."

230
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,120
"From here.. - I love the beach.
- To there.. - I love the beauty."

231
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,200
"The ocean stretches. The ocean.."

232
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:56,520
"A fire burns somewhere
within my heart."

233
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,040
"From here to there."

234
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,920
"The ocean stretches. The ocean.."

235
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,720
"C'mon, let the music play."

236
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,520
"C'mon, let the time away."

237
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,600
"We've got the party going on."

238
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,480
"We're going to
rock the night away."

239
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
"Everybody feeling high."

240
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,280
"Come and get what
you want to, baby."

241
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,600
"Your chance is passing by."

242
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,440
What babes, man!

243
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,920
One was.. The other was..

244
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,120
Babu, is your stomach
alright? - Yes.

245
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,520
Then why are you making such noises?

246
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,200
Those girls, pal..
- Yeah! Those girls.. Hey!

247
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,560
Hey!

248
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,360
Catch it! Catch it!

249
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,600
Come here!

250
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,760
Are you drunk? - No!

251
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,360
What are you doing with him, Babu?

252
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,280
I was taking him to brother Kishan.

253
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,800
Do you know he stole again,
yesterday?

254
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,760
You should be ashamed, Hari!
You've made Kishan's life hell.

255
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,760
He can't meet anybody.
Everybody assumes him to be you.

256
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,440
Obviously they'll assume so.
We're like Ram and Shyam, the twins.

257
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,040
By the way,
do you have a twin sister?

258
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,920
Sorry! - Hold this!

259
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,360
Keep this money and
get out of this locality.

260
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,760
Because of you,
Kishan avoids meeting dad.

261
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,440
Mom and dad have passed away.

262
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,520
I'm talking about my dad!

263
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,600
I don't have a problem.
C'mon, let's meet your dad.

264
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,120
It's the alcohol talking.

265
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,200
Babu, the farther he stays from me..

266
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,760
..the closer will Kishan be to me.

267
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,760
Why did you tell her that I'm drunk?

268
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,600
Kishan, don't fool
around with this girl.

269
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,120
Anuradha is such an innocent
girl and you're fooling her..

270
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,440
..by cooking up stories about twins.

271
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,520
I'm not fooling her, pal. She
had once seen me in this condition.

272
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,640
I got scared.
I told her that I've a twin brother.

273
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,280
Since then,
Kishan has to pretend to be Hari.

274
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,520
If I tell her the truth,
then she'll leave me.

275
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:38,280
Fine! Then just handover
50% of the money that she gave you.

276
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,600
You!

277
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,680
It's pretty small.
Here's a big one. Very good!

278
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,960
Pass it! Pass!

279
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,360
Hey! Shell out the money.

280
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,280
Why are you shouting?
What's the balance?

281
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,200
The old due. - Then add
this to it and collect it later.

282
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,600
But where will I search for you?

283
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,360
Hey! You don't have
to search for me.

284
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,840
Even the kids know me.
Am I knew here?

285
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,680
What nonsense are you talking?

286
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,280
Sir, does everybody out
here know you? - What is it?

287
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,520
Do you know him?

288
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,680
Who are you?

289
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,120
Look, I am what I am.
You can assume whatever you want to.

290
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,000
But please keep him in mind.

291
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,720
I've come to take him
and I'll surely take him back.

292
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,600
He was a wrestler! A wrestler!

293
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,120
The only thing I don't
understand is that..

294
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,280
..why someone outside
Goa's looking for you?

295
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,440
Tell me something,
have I fooled anybody outside Goa?

296
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,040
No! - Then where
has he sprung up from?

297
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,520
You should have looked at him.

298
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,760
He was looking like
a bull from Jaffrabad.

299
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,000
With a staff in his hand
and wearing a wraparound..

300
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,840
..he looked like
an illiterate villager.

301
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,520
Are you sure it was my photo?

302
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,360
I can identify your photo
even with my eyes closed.

303
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,600
I hope it wasn't Hari's photo.

304
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,680
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, I'm late.
- Did I say anything?

305
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,520
You didn't but then it's
my duty to explain myself.

306
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,520
Here, I was after this. Take it.

307
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,280
Anu, how many times have I
told you not to give money to Hari?

308
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,440
By giving him money, you're not..

309
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,360
..going to mend his ways, are you?
He'll not change.

310
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,360
He's a stain. He's like a birthmark.

311
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,600
He's stuck to my body.
He's like my shadow.

312
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,000
I know. I can
understand your problem.

313
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,520
You brothers are so
different from each other.

314
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
He doesn't have any manners, and..

315
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,200
..you're the epitome
of good manners.

316
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,840
Thanks, Anu. You're the only
one who understands my problem.

317
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,840
Thanks. Thank you.

318
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,000
What did he say?
Staff, wraparound, bull. Oh hell!

319
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,000
Brother! - Hey dhoti!

320
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,840
Move!

321
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,680
Stop! - I'm not going to stop!
- I'm Gopi!

322
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,920
My Kishan is again
into some problem!

323
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:40,440
Brother Kishan, listen to me!
Are you going to stop or not?

324
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,920
Stop! Else I'm going to kidnap you.
I'm warning you!

325
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,320
Brother Kishan!

326
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,520
What's that noise?

327
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,920
Kishan! Stop him!

328
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,600
Kishan, stop!

329
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,120
No!

330
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,840
You.. listen to me!

331
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,280
No! No!

332
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,040
I should be keeping a dog. A dog!

333
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,200
Hey! Somebody help me!
Somebody save me from this dog!

334
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,560
Hey brother!

335
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,040
Moti! Tommy!

336
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,520
Moti, hush! Go, dear. Go back home!

337
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,320
Go!

338
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,920
Hey! My wraparound!

339
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,120
Hey! My wraparound!

340
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Hey brother!
It's my wraparound. It's mine!

341
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
Hey! A mermaid!

342
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,600
Please help!

343
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
Please rescue me from these goons.

344
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,920
Come! I'll help you!

345
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,680
What happened, brother?

346
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,520
Hey you!

347
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,040
Run for your lives!

348
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,680
It took just four
slaps to get rid of them.

349
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,000
Thanks! - What? - Thank you.

350
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,440
Ok. Can you please return my honour?

351
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,600
What?! - My wraparound.

352
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,240
Sorry, can you drop
me home for that?

353
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,200
Drop you home? - Please! - Ok.

354
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,680
Where have you brought me?
Is this your house or a hotel?

355
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,600
This is my house.

356
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,600
You don't seem to
be a native of Goa.

357
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,840
Have you come here
looking for a job?

358
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,440
I've.. I've come to look for you.

359
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,600
He's not here. He must've gone
to Mumbai. To try in the movies.

360
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,280
No, no. He's very much here.
I've enquired.

361
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,920
But I couldn't find his address.

362
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,680
Then will you search for
him with this photo? - Yes!

363
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,760
By the way, where are you put up?

364
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Actually I.. nowhere.
I'm a stranger in this city.

365
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,360
Then listen to me.
You're going to stay in this hotel.

366
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,840
I'll tell the manager.

367
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,840
No, no. You've treated me so well.

368
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,600
Thank you very much for that.
Moreover, I can't be a..

369
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
..burden on you just a
few minutes after knowing you.

370
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,120
Oh c'mon!
What burden are you talking about?

371
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,600
You can stay here, you know.

372
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,440
Just for the sake
of convenience. - What?

373
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,520
Yes, you'll stay right here
and I'll help you look for him.

374
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,680
'Me and my wife, bought a TV.'

375
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,440
'We got a scratch
card and won a prize.'

376
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,680
'Four nights and three
days of free stay.'

377
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,360
Oh my God!

378
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,040
Mr. Takdir Singh
from Ludhiana. - Yes!

379
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,520
Please come. You're most welcome.

380
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,000
Thank you.
- You're our special guest.

381
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,920
Thank you. - Kalparamna,
it was written in our scratch card..

382
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
..4 nights/3 days free stay.
It's just the same, isn't it?

383
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,200
Absolutely!

384
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,840
Shankara, start off!

385
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,840
You've become so fat!

386
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,840
Sir, please follow me.

387
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,000
May I help you!

388
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,440
Hello, room service?

389
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,120
'We're going on a summer holiday.'

390
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,120
Mummy!

391
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,360
Oh my God!

392
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,440
Oh Shaky, are you alright!
It's all smashed!

393
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,280
It's ok, sir. No problem.

394
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,440
The charges for this
will be added to your bill.

395
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,080
How much has it cost? - Only 15000.

396
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,040
Add it to the bill, he'll pay it.

397
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,120
Won't you? Won't you? - Ok!

398
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,640
Dad, this is Kishan. - Are you sure?

399
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,920
Have a seat! Sit! - Ok.

400
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,760
Be comfortable. - Ok, sir.

401
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,280
I keep hearing about your
twin brother's antics from Anuradha.

402
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,600
Yes.

403
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,200
That's the reason
I cracked the joke.

404
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,360
Hello! - Hello, this is Brown here.

405
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,360
Tell me, inspector.
What made you think of me?

406
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,200
My wife has made purchases
worth Rs.5 lakhs from your shop.

407
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,760
Yes, absolutely.

408
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,760
And she didn't pay.
- I didn't ask either.

409
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,280
That's your big-heartedness.
But business is business.

410
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,440
I'll send you the Rs.5
lakh in two days. Cash.

411
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,280
No problem.

412
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,040
Your dad's moustache is too big.

413
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,840
Did you see, Kishan? - Yes!

414
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,120
A cop's job, a govt.
Salary. - I see.

415
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,200
And royal tastes.

416
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,360
His wife had made
purchases worth Rs.5 lakhs.

417
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,000
And now my friend wants
to settle the account in cash.

418
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,200
It's very obvious that
he must've received a huge bribe.

419
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,680
All corrupt souls!
I hate them! I hate them!

420
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,520
Dues worth Rs.5 lakhs!
I get jittery even if I keep a due..

421
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,440
..of Rs.2 with my grocery.

422
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,280
That's because you perspire
all day to earn your living.

423
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,480
Who perspires?

424
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,280
You, idiot! Who else? Your!

425
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,240
What has happened to me?
I forget my own job.

426
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,760
Then how'll I remember the name?
- Of whom?

427
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,000
The one who's giving
Rs.5 lakh in cash.

428
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,120
Oh! Him? His name is
inspector Brown. Brown.

429
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,040
Ok! - Will you
remember it now? - Yes.

430
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,200
Now, I'll remember his name
such that even he'll remember me.

431
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,200
Who? - Mr. Brown..

432
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,760
What is it? - Call your master.

433
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,440
Which master? - Mr. Brown.

434
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,240
Can't you see? I'm Mr. Brown.

435
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,680
Ridiculous!
You look very different when naked.

436
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,520
We're from Global Plumbing. - So?

437
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,360
We received a complaint.
- From whom?

438
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,120
Your wife. - Against whom?

439
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,600
Not against anyone.
About a leakage in the bathroom.

440
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Leakage in the bathroom?

441
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,520
Shall we start the work?

442
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,920
I think I have seen you somewhere.

443
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,440
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you very much.

444
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,840
I'm the model for
my company's ad campaign.

445
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,920
These are the kind of
photos they click of mine.

446
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,680
In fact, last year, I received
the plumber of the year award.

447
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,520
Amazing! Infact whenever somebody..

448
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,680
In fact, whoever meets me tells me..

449
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,280
..that they've seen
me somewhere before.

450
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,920
It's like as if I've
these supernatural powers.

451
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,080
Natural! Super!
Where's the bathroom? - There!

452
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,000
Thank you.

453
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,600
Where have I seen him?

454
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,520
Just now! You saw him with
me when you opened the door.

455
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,040
Ok! I've seen him with you.

456
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,680
It broke! Leakage!

457
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,760
Mr. Brown!

458
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,120
Mr. Brown!
- What's this? What have you done?

459
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,920
Do one thing! Do one thing!

460
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,440
You.. - Shall I
call the fire brigade?

461
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,360
Why? Do you want to give
them a water connection?

462
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,920
Have you gone crazy? Stand here.

463
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,280
Hold this and stand here.

464
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,000
Who me? - Else what? Me?

465
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Who's the plumber out here?
- You. - Exactly!

466
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,360
Who has to go to the top and shut
off the machine? - You. - Well done!

467
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,680
And who'll block the
pipe till then? - Me!

468
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,440
Well done!
Well done! Full marks! Full points!

469
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,280
Now hold it and stand here.
Not a drop should fall. You..

470
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,920
Not a drop should fall or
else aunt Shabana will be upset.

471
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,000
I'm warning you!

472
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,280
Stay put over there, don't move.

473
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,880
Mr. Brown,
don't let even a drop fall.

474
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,600
Do you know what aunt Shabana says?

475
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,120
You should save two
buckets of water everyday.

476
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,200
Ok! Ok! Now hurry up
and shut off the machine.

477
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,040
I do everything in a hurry.

478
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,920
Hey! Shut off the machine, plumber!

479
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,440
Hey plumber!

480
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,600
Plumber! Plumber! Plumber!

481
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,120
The day I lay my hands on you,
I'll make you clean..

482
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,280
..all the toilets in
all the prisons across India.

483
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,120
He made me stand in the
bathroom and burgled all..

484
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,440
..the five rooms in my house.
Bloody plumber! - Greetings, sir!

485
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,600
He looks worried!

486
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,560
Sir, did you find that thief?

487
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,680
Forgive me. Do you sell salt?

488
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Then why are you sprinkling
salt on my wounds?

489
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Or does my angry face
look like boiled eggs..

490
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,280
..that tempts you
to sprinkle salt on it?

491
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,280
The burglary took place in my house.

492
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,280
Do you want to announce
it to the entire world?

493
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,920
I'm a police officer.
I can nab the thief whenever I want.

494
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,040
No, inspector. We've just
come to ask if you've seen..

495
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,520
..this man anywhere.

496
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,280
Are you checking
my general knowledge?

497
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,160
Isn't he the same guy?
The model for Global Plumbing?

498
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,680
Plumber of the year,
the nephew of aunt Shabana.

499
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,200
Bloody plumber! Rascal!

500
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,200
Plumber of the year!
The nephew of aunt Shabana!

501
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,520
Rascal!

502
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,760
Hi Tania!
- Hey Tania! - Hi! - Hi guys!

503
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,600
How are you? - How are you?

504
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
It's so good to see you.
I'm here only.

505
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,520
Hi! - Hey! How are you?

506
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Hey! - Hey Gopi!
What are you doing? He's my friend.

507
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,760
Hey! Who's this cannibal?

508
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,000
Shut up guys! He's Gopi,
the one who saved me that day.

509
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,880
He's the Indian Arnold.

510
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,360
Hey! Nice to meet you, man.
That's cool.

511
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,360
Hey Tania! - You should throw a
party tonight, man. What do you say?

512
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,760
Yeah man!
We've got to rock the party!

513
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,680
We've got to toast for Tania
and for this gentleman. Yes.

514
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,920
C'mon guys! - Yeah!

515
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,760
"You make me fall again!"

516
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,120
"Just waiting for the game."

517
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,520
"Just wait a little while,
you'll bring back my smile."

518
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,680
"Stole my heart for ten reasons."

519
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,520
"Stole my heart for ten reasons.
- You stole my heart from me."

520
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,200
"Stole my heart for ten reasons."

521
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,120
"Stole my heart for ten reasons.
- You stole my heart from me."

522
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,760
"Just chill.. chill.. just chill."

523
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,520
"Just chill.. chill.. just chill."

524
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,120
"Just chill!"

525
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,200
Where are you going, my Indian idol?

526
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,040
I'm going to the room. - Sit here.

527
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,000
Please. Leave me, please. - Why?

528
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,600
Isn't my room yours? Am I not yours?

529
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,360
Or are you not mine?

530
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,840
It is not so.

531
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,800
Gopi, you've such a nice body.

532
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,840
And a very native smell.
Give me one deep kiss.

533
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,600
What? - Kiss! A kiss!

534
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,000
See, you're drunk.
- Idiot! I want to get more high.

535
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,600
Why don't you understand? Fool!

536
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,040
It's Saturday today.

537
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,360
Would've you kissed
me had it been a Sunday?

538
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,520
No way! - It's Saturday night fever,
Gopi. Give me a kiss.

539
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,120
Don't trouble me further.

540
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,280
Look, I'll make the dog
chase you otherwise. - No!

541
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,120
Give me!
Why are you acting like this?

542
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,840
God! Are you breathing your last?

543
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,680
C'mon kiss, pal.

544
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,200
What are you doing with a stranger?

545
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,680
Gopi, tell me something.
Are you a stranger..

546
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:49,040
Leave me! - Kiss me!
You idiot! Stupid! Illiterate!

547
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,200
Ignorant peasant!
You're acting pricey..

548
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,440
..just because I flirted
a little with you!

549
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,840
You just threw me!
You denied me! You rejected me!

550
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:04,920
How dare you! How dare you! Useless!

551
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,920
Praise be to the almighty!

552
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,520
It seems it's madam's
birthday today.

553
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,920
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.

554
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:57,280
Happy birthday dear Radha.
Happy birthday to you.

555
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,280
"Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!"

556
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,280
"Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!"

557
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:32,520
"Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!"

558
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,360
"Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!"

559
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,120
"Greetings! Greetings!"

560
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,720
"Greetings! Greetings!"

561
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,600
"I've drunk wine,
which everybody says is bad."

562
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,360
"I've drunk wine,
which everybody says is bad."

563
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,360
"What have you drunk?"

564
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,760
"Greetings! Greetings! Greetings!"

565
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,800
"Greetings! Greetings! Greetings!"

566
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,200
"Listen my boy, we've got
the latest fashion in place."

567
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,440
"Breaking it down to the hot,
hot, hot me.."

568
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,840
"If you know what I mean."

569
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,840
"Oh yeah!"

570
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,760
"Neither do you have
shame nor modesty."

571
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,360
"You've forgotten
traditions and customs."

572
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,760
"Neither do you have
shame nor modesty."

573
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,320
"You've forgotten
traditions and customs."

574
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,360
"I haven't seen a
woman like you before."

575
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,600
"Greetings! Greetings! - O yeah!"

576
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:04,200
"Greetings! Greetings! - O yeah!"

577
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,600
"Play it!
Play it! Play it with your heart!"

578
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,760
"Yet again I remember the trees,
the river bank, the village."

579
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,280
"The anklets tinkled
and the skirts swayed."

580
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,000
"I haven't been able to forget
the kohl and the earrings, yet."

581
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,600
"Oh yeah!"

582
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:36,000
"I trade in emotions. I'm
a crazy guy who just shows love."

583
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:45,040
"I trade in emotions. I'm
a crazy guy who just shows love."

584
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,920
"I've already told
you whatever I had to say."

585
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,280
"Greetings! Greetings!"

586
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:58,080
"Greetings! Greetings!"

587
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,960
"I've drunk wine,
which everybody says is bad."

588
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,560
"I've drunk wine,
which everybody says is bad."

589
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,600
"What have you drunk?"

590
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:19,600
"O yeah! O yeah!"

591
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,600
"Greetings! Greetings! Greetings!"

592
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,680
"Greetings! Greetings! Greetings!"

593
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,600
"Greetings! Greetings! Greetings!"

594
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,600
"Greetings! Greetings! Greetings!"

595
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,520
"Greetings! Greetings! Greetings!"

596
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,360
"Greetings! Greetings! Greetings!"

597
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,600
Mr. Gopi, do you want to drink more?

598
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,600
Why? Do you have a problem?

599
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,760
Problem? That too, me? Never!

600
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,000
Moreover, you only had
told me just now amidst all..

601
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,280
..that I don't have
shame or modesty.

602
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,200
Then why should such
a girl have a problem.

603
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,680
Oh! I wasn't talking
about you alone.

604
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,560
I was talking about
all your friends also.

605
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,200
Don't defend yourself.
You were targeting me.

606
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,080
You weren't singing, Gopi.
You were mocking at me.

607
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,600
Because the place
where you come from..

608
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,000
..doesn't approve of my lifestyle.

609
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,080
Isn't it?

610
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:51,360
But it's ok.
I think it's not your fault.

611
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,840
You can't see all this.

612
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:01,760
You can't see that this girl
has been so lonely since childhood.

613
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,920
Without a mother,
this child has only been showered..

614
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,520
..with money by her father.

615
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,280
He never told her a bedtime story.

616
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,520
In four days, even you
came to the conclusion that..

617
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,520
..she's a rich spoilt brat.
And mocked at me so much.

618
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:29,920
Gopi, we so easily accuse
people of being bad from a distance.

619
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,200
Do we ever make an attempt
to get closer to them and..

620
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,840
..find out why they're bad,

621
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,040
Air Sahara welcomes all it's
passengers arriving from Mumbai.

622
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,720
Where's our informer?

623
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,120
When does he inform
about his whereabouts?

624
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,600
Did you inform him
that we're coming?

625
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,200
That constable was nagging me.

626
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,600
I told him to stop nagging
else I'll beat him to pulp.

627
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,760
Who got in? Who got in?! Hey!

628
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,360
Keep it in!
- Hey! Blackberry! Who are you?

629
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,440
Passenger! Passenger!

630
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,680
How are you? - Find out his name.

631
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,680
Just a moment, I'll tell you. Tulsi.

632
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,920
I'm not Irani, I'm Goan.

633
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,000
"I'm the like the basil
that grows at your doorstep."

634
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,200
I'm like the basil that
grows at your doorstep?

635
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,360
What happened? - That's the same
song that my mother used to sing.

636
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,360
What an emotional fool!

637
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,600
I'm the like the basil
that grows at your doorstep.

638
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,440
But she passed away without
telling me about that doorstep.

639
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,000
We haven't come here
to look for doorsteps.

640
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,600
We've come here for
these three girls. - Yes!

641
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,920
Being a girl yourself,
you're hitting on girls.

642
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Whom are you calling a girl? - You!
You moustached girl. - Shut up!

643
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,000
I'm known as fire. - You
should be known as rose. Black rose.

644
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,680
Have you seen these
three girls anywhere?

645
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,880
These?! I dropped them just now.

646
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,920
Where? - Where?!
- Why should I tell you?

647
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,280
Hey! - Hands up!

648
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,720
Where?

649
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,040
Come! Come! Come!

650
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,000
Where? Where? Where?

651
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,920
Here it is. - Where is it?

652
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,840
That building in front.
Just behind that.

653
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,880
Building? Is that a building?
- Sorry, I'm used to speaking..

654
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,120
..English, that's why.

655
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,280
Those ruins.
They went behind those ruins.

656
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,920
Behind those ruins? - Go!

657
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,360
Let's sneak up quietly and..

658
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,680
Sir, your luggage. - Did
I ask you to take out my luggage?

659
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,200
Did I ask you to
take out your luggage?

660
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,040
I've kept it! I've kept it!

661
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,200
Wait here, we'll be back in 5 min.

662
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,040
Ok! Ok! - Follow me! Follow me!

663
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,520
Is there a way through this?

664
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,120
It's that way,
be careful else you'll fall.

665
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,520
Be careful.

666
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,560
Ok. Follow me!

667
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,040
Why do all these intelligent
people come to Goa?

668
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,680
Because..

669
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,440
Let's dance!

670
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,280
That's ok! Let's try again.

671
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,600
That was much better but
you're still lacking precision.

672
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,560
Yeah!

673
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,920
Hi! - Hello!

674
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,520
Tell me clearly if you
are an informer or a duffer.

675
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,120
Today because of you
my luggage was stolen..

676
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,480
..and you expect me
to be in this one suit?

677
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,840
I am such a big don and
a taxi-driver stole my luggage?

678
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,440
And you know what
his name is? - What?

679
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,280
What? - His name is Phunsi.
- It's not Phunsi.

680
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:09,760
I will chain you so tight..
I will chain you so tight..

681
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,440
..that the companies
that make glues..

682
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,200
..would make you
their brand ambassador.

683
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,000
You dared to steal
in an inspector's house..

684
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,760
That too an inspector like me

685
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,200
He stole in an inspector's house.

686
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,120
How does it bother you!
Tell me why you came here.

687
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,600
Someone stole in my home as well.
- I see.

688
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,520
You are also an inspector?
- Not an inspector. I am Ladla.

689
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,360
Ladla (dear one)? Whose?

690
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:35,440
My name is Ladla.
- If your name is Ladla..

691
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,920
..what's his name?
Dalda (clarified butter)?

692
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,760
Look, we came to Goa in
search of these three girls.

693
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,960
These three girls.
And when.. - I see.

694
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,080
Girls are three and you are two.

695
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,480
So these girls have
stolen your luggage.

696
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,920
I will keep this photo.
I'll inform you when we get them.

697
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,920
No, you don't need
to search them. - Why?

698
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,360
They had stolen, hadn't they?
- Yes. No. No.

699
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,200
When we came out of the airport..

700
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,760
..the one who stole our luggage..

701
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,520
..we're looking for him.
- Who's that?

702
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,360
Taxi driver.
And his name is.. - Phunsi!

703
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,360
Phunsi! No, no!
- Tulsi! - Yes, Tulsi. - Yes.

704
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,840
Ok. Where's his photo?

705
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,200
I don't have his photo.

706
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,680
I'm getting confused.

707
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,000
You don't have to look
for those in this photo.

708
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,200
No, you don't have to.

709
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,920
Instead I've to look for
the one who's not on the photo.

710
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,280
Yes, that's right!

711
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,680
Jesus Christ!

712
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,200
The one who's photo isn't there..
- Isn't there..

713
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,280
He has to be looked for. - Yes.

714
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,920
Because he has stolen your luggage.
- Yes, that's right.

715
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,600
And I don't have to look
for those on the photo? - No!

716
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,600
Brilliant! - But even they've
stolen something, isn't it?

717
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:46,520
Yes, they have. They've
stolen jewellery worth 25 crores.

718
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,280
My mother's.. - Where's your mother?

719
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,680
Mother's not there.
- Who was wearing the jewellery?

720
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,120
No one was. It was kept in a box.

721
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,840
Where was the box?
- It was in the cupboard.

722
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,440
And where was the cupboard?
- At home.

723
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,680
And mom? - She passed away.

724
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,520
From where?
She passed by the cupboard?

725
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,440
My mother passed
away from this world.

726
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,600
Oh! I'm very sorry!
Very sorry, Mr. Ladla! Very sorry!

727
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,680
Now I'm able to
understand things clearly.

728
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,200
Your mother passed away.

729
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,280
These three girls
came for the funeral.

730
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,760
Yes, they came for the funeral. -
And left with your mom's jewellery.

731
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,440
Yes! - And you were
in a fix when your..

732
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,000
..mother's jewellery
went missing.. - Yes.

733
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,040
..and you became bankrupt.
- Yes, I became bankrupt.

734
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,840
Then you caught the 1pm flight
and came here at two. - Yes, I did.

735
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,120
At 3 pm, the taxi driver
robbed you and went home.

736
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,920
Yes, he went home. - And at five..

737
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
..you came to my office
to file a complaint.

738
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,680
Yes, I did. - Stop saying
mother every now and then.

739
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,520
Else he'll slip into a coma.

740
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,760
Hey! Your voice is thinner
than the hands of a watch..

741
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,440
..and you dare to threaten me!

742
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,760
Please track down my luggage,
inspector.

743
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,040
I've been wearing
the same suit all day.

744
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,440
What do you think?
I change my dress everyday..

745
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,280
..before coming to office?

746
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,680
I've been wearing this same
uniform for the past 15 years.

747
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,280
See! - Don't know
why everybody who come..

748
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,000
..here have their luggage stolen!

749
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,720
Please take down my complaint!

750
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,400
What do I write in
the complaint?! Yes?

751
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,040
Every information is incomplete.

752
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,040
The other day a guy
with a staff came. - I see.

753
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,760
He was showing me
the photo of one person..

754
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,760
..and searching for another.
- I see.

755
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,040
Both of you get out of here, now.

756
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,680
We're leaving. - Let me think! - Ok!

757
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,200
I have a headache.
- But I should get the dress. - Out!

758
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,280
Ok! But I should get back my dress.
- Hey! Not you!

759
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,600
You shouldn't get up!
Plumber of the year!

760
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,920
I'll break your legs if you get up!

761
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,280
I'll cane you!

762
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,120
Hello, Mr. Brown!

763
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,440
I'd have sent that
5 lakhs to your house..

764
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,280
..what was the need to come here?

765
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,920
I don't keep petty cash here!

766
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,400
Mr. Brown, I haven't come
here to ask about the 5 lakhs..

767
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,840
..but to introduce
my gem of a son-in-law.

768
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,520
Anu! - Kishan!

769
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,520
This is Kishan!

770
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,520
He's Kishan!
But he told me he's a plumber!

771
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,680
Plumber?! - No! He's Kishan.

772
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,680
No, pal. He's a plumber.

773
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,600
He's actually a thief.
He burgled my house.

774
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,680
He's not the one. - That
must be his twin brother, Hari.

775
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,280
He's the one who cons people.

776
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,440
Then what does he do? - He bears
the punishment for his misdeeds.

777
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,000
Then where's he?
- That's your job to find out.

778
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,480
We're going to take him along.
- That means I've to leave him.

779
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,520
Absolutely!

780
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,680
Firstly, he's innocent and secondly,
he's my son-in-law.

781
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,840
If you're going to take him then
who's going to be in the lock-up.

782
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,120
Where will I get that Hari?

783
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,840
Uncle, are you the cop or us?

784
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,280
Have you caught the wrong guy or us?

785
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,280
Has the burglary happened
in your house or ours?

786
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,200
Will you nab the real thief or us?

787
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,680
Ms. Tania! - What is it now?

788
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,520
Hasn't the manager told you that..

789
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,960
Yes, he did tell me that
you don't want to meet me.

790
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,760
But I wanted to meet
you before leaving. - Why?

791
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,440
Is there anything left to say?

792
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,200
No, Tania.
You're misunderstanding me.

793
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,840
If I'd told you something wrong
in my drunken stupor, last night..

794
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,520
..then kindly forgive me for that.

795
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,520
I can never misbehave with you.

796
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:27,360
It's just that I couldn't
bear to see you in that state.

797
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,680
Liquor is not the cure
for loneliness, Ms. Tania.

798
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,120
In fact, liquor makes
one all the more lonely.

799
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,440
Those who encourage
you to succumb to liquor..

800
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,840
..aren't your friends
but your enemies.

801
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,360
You've everything by God's grace.

802
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,040
God forbid,
if you lose it all in the future..

803
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:54,360
..then these friends of yours
won't be there with you either.

804
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,440
Learn to identify true friends,
Ms. Tania.

805
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,280
I'll take your leave now.

806
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,120
Gopi! - Yes?

807
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:11,040
Where are you going?
- Back to my village.

808
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,920
Back to your village?
But you've promised somebody.

809
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,680
I'll seek forgiveness from God.

810
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,280
Who all will you
seek forgiveness from?

811
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,600
You were apologising
to me sometime back..

812
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,600
..now you're even going
to apologise to God.

813
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,440
What to do, madam? I'm in a fix.

814
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,040
How can the one who helps
others find the right path..

815
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,600
..be in a fix himself?

816
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,680
Gopi, you're not the
one who's trapped. It's me.

817
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:49,440
What? - In your simplicity.
In your honesty. In your love.

818
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Pappu has passed his exams! Kishan!

819
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,600
Pappu has passed his exams!

820
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,680
I've tracked down the girls.
They are staying in GK resort.

821
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,600
Mind blowing! C'mon!

822
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,040
Hello! May I help you, sir?

823
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,080
Yes. - I need a room.

824
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,920
Single or double? - Two singles.

825
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:17,280
Why don't you take a double?
- Who needs the room?

826
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,040
You, sir. - Who's paying?

827
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,840
You, sir.

828
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,920
Then why are you
giving me free advice?

829
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,760
Open your register.
- How long will you be staying, sir?

830
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,040
Normally we don't wait
for more than a second.

831
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,120
But sometimes we've
to go in for 7 years.

832
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,760
Stay back!
He meant stay back. - Yes.

833
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,920
You can leave that area blank.

834
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,120
Right, sir. - Thank you.

835
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,440
Thank you! - Thank you.

836
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,520
Come along, idiot.
- Please attend the counter.

837
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,000
I'll teach you a lesson or two.

838
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,120
'Mr. Black! Mr. White! '

839
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,120
Kishan. - Yes.

840
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,000
Is it?

841
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,600
Babu! - Yes?

842
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,200
Don't come in between.

843
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,520
Go!

844
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:24,840
Kishan! Hey Kishan!
Please wait! Wait!

845
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:35,000
Where do I hide from this wrestler?
He's after my life!

846
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,120
Hey Kishan! I know you're here.

847
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,600
Look..

848
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,600
Look Kishan,
please come out wherever you are.

849
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,040
I've come to take you back.

850
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,680
I should've kept a dog!

851
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,760
Had I kept a dog then you
wouldn't have been able to catch me.

852
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,000
Police! Police! - There's
a small station in the village.

853
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,840
You can find the cops there.

854
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,520
Hey wrestler,
please leave me! Please!

855
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,120
Even if I lose my wraparound, this
time I'll surely take you along.

856
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,760
Why are you after me?

857
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,280
I'm not after you.
Your dad was after my dad.

858
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,000
To find out the truth about you.

859
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,000
What rubbish are you talking?
My dad has my complete address.

860
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,120
And how did you and
your dad come into this?

861
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,440
Come along with me to Hoshiarpur.
I'll tell you everything there.

862
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,000
By the way, what's the matter?

863
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:41,680
It's a 25 year old case.
- Case? What case?

864
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,000
Court case.

865
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,920
Which court? - Hoshiarpur court.

866
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,760
But how am I concerned
with a case between two fathers.

867
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,120
Because you're his only heir,
brother.

868
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,360
Heir? - Yes.

869
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,520
What am I getting? - Land.

870
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:02,120
How much will it be worth?
- Rs.25000!

871
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,360
A land worth Rs.25000? Do
you expect me to bring it down here?

872
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,440
That's why I'm taking you there.
You've to come along with me.

873
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,000
No, I'm not coming. - You have to.

874
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,680
Are you trying to use force? Are
you a cop? Do you have a warrant?

875
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,000
Am I your father's property?

876
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,280
Hey! What are you doing?!

877
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,440
Are you going to ask
me for a warrant, Kishan?

878
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,600
I'm a devotee of Lord Hanuman.

879
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,840
He had set fire to
Lanka without a warrant.

880
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,360
He had lifted the Drona
hill without a warrant.

881
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:39,760
You must hardly be
weighing 40-50 kg. - 70kg!

882
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,360
I'll carry you up to Hoshiarpur
in my palm. I swear on Lord Ram!

883
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,000
Wrestler! Wrestler!
- Are you coming along with me?

884
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,640
Pack your bags and be ready.

885
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,440
I'll return soon. See you!

886
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,520
Ma'am, this is ruby. Original!

887
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:05,360
Ruby! Very good!

888
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,600
No, no!

889
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,280
Pack this! - No! No!

890
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,000
Can I show you something in gold?

891
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,280
Gold?! Gold! - No, no!

892
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,760
Where? Where is the gold? - Yeah.
I will show you. - Bring it..

893
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:17,920
Bring it! Get the gold! Get it!

894
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,760
Car! Mom, I want the car..

895
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,840
No more cars!

896
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,440
You want the car? Take it.

897
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,080
Hey, madam. Pack this also - No, no!

898
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,200
Where's the gold? - No, no!

899
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,760
Why's he saying no?
- Because my BP's shooting..

900
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,000
..up on thinking of the bill.

901
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:39,760
My wife has so much gold
that if she walks the street..

902
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,440
..wearing all her gold then she
would look like a mobile goldmine..

903
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,440
Let it be! Let it be! Pack all this!

904
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,200
He'll settle the bills. Won't you?

905
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,360
Won't you?

906
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,280
Look, he agreed.

907
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:01,360
Oh good Lord!
There's Complan for growing kids..

908
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,920
..but what plan is
there for growing bills.

909
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,840
What are you doing here, dancer?

910
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,280
I am where you are.

911
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:51,000
Hey macho man!
- Sexy bomb! I like it!

912
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:54,200
Hey do you come here daily?

913
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:58,760
No. By the way, if you invite me,
I'll come whenever you..

914
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,360
..want me to.

915
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,360
Which band do you play for?
- How does it matter?

916
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,280
I can play it on anybody.
How about you?

917
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,360
As long as somebody
doesn't play it on you..

918
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,760
..you'll never understand.

919
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,280
But you're able to understand,
darling.

920
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,760
Why have you come here?

921
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,080
The same reason for
which you've come here.

922
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,920
Do you think you're Romeo?

923
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,840
Had you been Juliet,
then I would've been Romeo.

924
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,960
But it would've been
better had you been Radha..

925
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,080
..because I'm Kishan.

926
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,520
And I'm Gopi.
- You?! Is this a wrestling ring..

927
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,000
..what are you doing here?
I don't like him.

928
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,120
Ladies, I'm Gopal
Murlimanohar from Hoshiarpur.

929
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,520
How long are you going to be here?

930
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,280
As long as you're here.
I'll leave when you leave.

931
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,600
What are you saying?

932
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,760
Should I wrestle with
you or have fun with them.

933
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,600
Fun? Right!

934
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,520
Fun?! Yeah, let's have fun.
- Yeah!

935
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:49,200
C'mon, let's go. - Hey go! I'm Gopi.

936
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,440
He's not going with you!

937
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,200
He's going to come
with me to Hoshiarpur.

938
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,520
C'mon, leave me!

939
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,080
To hell with your Hoshiarpur!
What are you acting smart for!

940
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,440
Have you gone crazy?

941
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,200
You've started fighting
with me on meeting girls.

942
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,360
Look, girls, you can flirt
with him as much as you want to..

943
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,840
..but at the end of the day
he's going with me to Hoshiarpur..

944
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,760
..I've promised your dad.

945
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,520
Kishan! Brother Kishan!

946
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,200
Oh! This is fun!

947
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,080
I'm scared of that staff
wielding guy who keeps..

948
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:27,600
..stalking me.
I think his mother must've sung..

949
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:32,000
..songs from horror movies
to him instead of lullabies.

950
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,760
I am fed up of this guy.

951
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,760
Hello, Mr. Kishan! - You?!

952
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,760
Village! - Ghost!

953
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,600
Kishan! Kishan! Where are you?!

954
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,360
Goddamn!

955
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,120
This guy is troubling me!

956
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,080
He doesn't even let me visit
the toilet in peace.

957
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,160
On one hand these girls
are troubling me for diamonds..

958
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,360
and on the other hand he stands
in my path like an RTO officer.

959
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,440
Don't you have
anything better to do?

960
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,760
You're standing out
here like a statue!

961
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:25,200
You think I am a part of
a herd that chase me with a staff?

962
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,920
If you keep scaring me
with that staff of yours then..

963
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,440
..I'll break it one day.

964
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,680
I'm not going to
Hoshiarpur for Rs.25000.

965
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,080
I'm not going to leave
behind millions for dimes.

966
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,760
Have I gone crazy? Am I that stupid?

967
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,680
Do one thing,
you keep that land for yourself.

968
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,080
From me to you.
Thank me for it and leave.

969
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,080
Don't eat my brains!

970
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,760
I would've eaten your brains,
if you had them.

971
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,760
If you had brains then
you would've celebrated your..

972
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,760
..father's victory.
You would've come..

973
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,920
..with me to Hoshiarpur
and chosen your piece of land.

974
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,360
You would've erected
a memorial for your dad.

975
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,280
What kind of a son are you?

976
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,600
Why are you getting
so sentimental about my dad?

977
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:14,000
It's better for me to go
along with you to Hoshiarpur..

978
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,760
..rather than have
you stalking me all day.

979
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,440
Really?!

980
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,360
Will you come with me to Hoshiarpur?

981
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,760
You arrange for the tickets
and I'll pack my bags.

982
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,000
Tickets? We'll go to
Bombay by bus and from there..

983
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,920
..we'll take a train to Hoshiarpur.

984
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,760
No! Bus and trains? No!

985
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:35,760
We'll take a flight from
here to Delhi. Rs.10000. - 10000?!

986
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:41,080
Yes. From there,
AC train to Ambala. Rs.5000.

987
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,280
From there a bus..
I won't travel in a bus.

988
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,840
We'll hire an AC car.
At the rate of Rs.10 per km.

989
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,760
It'll be Rs.6000. How much?

990
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,440
21000! - 21000 to
go and 21000 to come.

991
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,760
Arrange for that money
and I'll come along..

992
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,760
I don't have that much money?!

993
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,440
What?! You don't have money? - No.

994
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,120
Then how'll I come to Hoshiarpur?

995
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,360
Who promised dad? - I.

996
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,360
Who vowed to take
me to Hoshiarpur? - I.

997
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,080
Then who'll arrange for the money?
- I. - Then?!

998
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,080
Arrange the money and
I will come to Hoshiarpur.

999
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,200
If I arrange the money you'll
come to Hoshiarpur with me?

1000
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,680
Definitely.. - Swear on me.

1001
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,080
I promise that you
arrange for the money..

1002
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,200
..and I'll go along
with you to Hoshiarpur.

1003
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:21,920
Ok. I'll go.

1004
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,600
How can you escape so easily!

1005
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,440
And you also promise that
you'll not show me your face..

1006
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,600
..or stalk me till
you arrange for the money.

1007
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,760
Yes, I promise not to
stalk you or show my face.

1008
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:42,200
Yeah baby! - Kishan! - What is it?

1009
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,840
The mermaids are bathing.
- So should I apply soap on them?

1010
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,080
I meant the girls. - Which girls?

1011
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,520
The girls who were bathing - What!
Where are they?

1012
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,920
In the swimming pool.
- Mind blowing!

1013
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,360
We'll go their to swim
and while swimming we'll

1014
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,440
Befriend them and ask
them where the diamonds are.

1015
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,520
And you think they'll tell you?
They'll beat you to pulp.

1016
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,080
If they're swimming in the pool
then we'll clean up their room..

1017
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,080
..by then.
Find out their room no. Ok.

1018
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,080
Yes! I'll ask them right away!

1019
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:11,760
Idiot! Why will you go and ask them!
Ask the waiter.

1020
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,520
Take it! - Pass it on! - Take it!

1021
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,000
Here!

1022
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,360
Pass it here! C'mon!

1023
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,840
C'mon! Get it! - I'll get it!

1024
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,960
Kishan! Why don't you
be the elder brother and..

1025
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,960
..seek one of their
hands in marriage for me.

1026
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:49,000
Why? - That way we can ask them
to give us the diamonds as dowry.

1027
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,800
Shut up!
You just keep on blabbering.

1028
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,600
Kishan! Listen to me! Oh I broke it!

1029
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,200
O my God! Where have they gone man!

1030
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:01,320
Hey! Move aside!
What kind of a bat is this!

1031
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,400
Why are you breaking that TV?

1032
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,200
They could've hidden it in the TV.

1033
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,480
Then couldn't you
switch on the TV and see.

1034
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,840
Donkey. - Sorry! Sorry!

1035
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,880
That's the way! I like it!

1036
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:26,840
No! No! I don't like it!

1037
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,280
Oh my God!
I've to renovate that entire room.

1038
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:47,640
2.5 lakhs plus 25000. You'll
have to pay another 3.5 lakhs, sir.

1039
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,240
In rupees? - Right, sir.

1040
01:13:54,640 --> 01:14:00,200
Are you ok, sir? - No, man!
I wasn't even in the room.

1041
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,160
I don't even know who broke it.

1042
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:06,440
But it's your room, sir. - No!
It's your room. You can keep it.

1043
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:11,040
Right, sir. But it's in your name.
And the keys are with you.

1044
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,600
The one who has the
keys has to pay the fine?

1045
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,440
C'mon, hurry up! Get dressed up.

1046
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,400
I'm sure that even
when the don comes..

1047
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,520
..he won't find us or the diamonds.

1048
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,840
Oh the diamonds.

1049
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,000
Where are the diamonds?

1050
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,600
It's in the locker, idiot!
C'mon now, hurry up.

1051
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,320
Locker!

1052
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,360
Ask the kid to keep quiet,
I'm not able to think.

1053
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,360
Right away!

1054
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,120
I want to play now. It's mine!

1055
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,320
No, dear.
We can keep it away for now.

1056
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,280
No, it's mine. It's mine.

1057
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,360
Shut up!

1058
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,560
Hey bandmaster!

1059
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,520
I'll make her dance to my tunes!

1060
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,840
Kid, what's your dad's room no?

1061
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,400
211! - Ok!

1062
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,600
211! Now you eat the chocolate and..

1063
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,440
..I'll play with
the police vehicles.

1064
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,960
There's a police siren in that!

1065
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,640
We will scare people with this.

1066
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,680
Who is that?

1067
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,320
Hurry!

1068
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,600
Oh God! - Why did the three of
us leave the locker and come here?

1069
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:53,880
C'mon!

1070
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,800
The bandmaster! Shit!

1071
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:13,160
Gopi! Brother Gopi!

1072
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,920
What are you turning your
face away for? Am I naked?

1073
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,800
You had made me promise
that I shouldn't show you my..

1074
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,280
..face until I get the tickets.

1075
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,760
Don't bother about that,
I've got the tickets.

1076
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,160
Here, look. - Really?

1077
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,920
Have I ever lied?

1078
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,280
Moreover,
even if you had taken the money..

1079
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:33,320
..no one would've given
you flight tickets. - Yes?

1080
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,680
That Anuradha is
coming along with me.

1081
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,800
Actually she hasn't
seen a Goa without the sea.

1082
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,360
If you want you
can bring Tania along.

1083
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,480
Really? - Yes.

1084
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,320
That'll be great, brother. - Great?

1085
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,640
But we'll spend our
honeymoon here in Goa.

1086
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:47,800
Not in Hoshiarpur.

1087
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:52,800
You're truly like Lord Krishna.
Naughty and romantic.

1088
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,200
It's paining! - Forgive me.

1089
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:57,760
Thank you. You can praise me later.

1090
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,880
I'm in a hurry now. Let's go.

1091
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,760
I'm all set. C'mon! Let's go!

1092
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,920
Where did the bandmaster go?

1093
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:08,000
We must catch him.
- Yes we should. - Yes, of course.

1094
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:40,520
Don, my fate is so bad!

1095
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,680
Everybody has to die
someday including me.

1096
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,480
But just see in how many
different ways one can die.

1097
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,400
By train accidents, road accidents,
plane crash. You know?

1098
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,240
Some drown in a ship,
some drown in liquor.

1099
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:59,000
Some are poisoned to death.
TB, malaria, AIDS, etc.

1100
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:00,640
There's no dignity in their death.

1101
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,640
Dignity is there in my death.

1102
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:05,200
I'm going to die
in the hands of a don.

1103
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,800
A don who's going to die
a dog's death at the hands of..

1104
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,760
..the police.

1105
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,800
I meant, instead of dying
a dog's death at the hands..

1106
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:17,080
..of the police, he should
directly be bitten by dogs.

1107
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,840
Who's the dog? - There's
neither a mirror to show you..

1108
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,280
..nor is there any time.

1109
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:28,880
But Don,
I've a final wish before I die.

1110
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,440
Please fulfill it.

1111
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,200
What's the last wish?

1112
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:36,160
Mother used to tell me..

1113
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,080
Mother?

1114
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,520
Mother. - Mother?

1115
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:45,600
Mother used to tell me
that if there's no way out then..

1116
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,280
..we should watch a
movie at a nearby theatre..

1117
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,280
..then we would surely find a way.

1118
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,920
And there is no theatre nearby.

1119
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,560
And you don't have a VCR..

1120
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:01,600
But I only have tragic movies..

1121
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,400
I don't want to die laughing anyway.

1122
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,080
If I cry by seeing those movies..

1123
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,240
..my heart will be
rid of all the burden.

1124
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,000
Maybe even the body would lighten.

1125
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,680
You wouldn't have a
difficulty lifting me up.

1126
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,960
Don, will you show me the film?

1127
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,840
It's my mother's last wish..
Mother! The last film..

1128
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:31,760
Don't cry! Switch on the TV..
Play a nice classic movie.

1129
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:33,680
Play a nice old classic movie.

1130
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:43,400
"You're so nice.
You're so innocent."

1131
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:54,600
"You're so lovely. O mother!"

1132
01:20:55,480 --> 01:21:00,760
"O Mother!"

1133
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:07,840
"You're so nice.
You're so innocent."

1134
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:16,720
"You're so lovely. O mother!"

1135
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:22,400
"O Mother!"

1136
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,920
"This world.."

1137
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:33,320
You're crying! I'm leaving.
- No! Where are you going?

1138
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,480
To stop those tears.

1139
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:44,480
They flow such that there's
no line or valve behind them.

1140
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,280
There's nothing to stop them.

1141
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:49,360
Oh God! I've even given
up my plumber's job.

1142
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:53,440
I'm going to look for
a mother for you, don.

1143
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,480
Where will you get her from?
- I'll find her, don.

1144
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:01,720
I'll get you my mother.
I'm going to die.

1145
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,240
Who'll take care of my mother?

1146
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,760
You're the only one, don. Only you.

1147
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:10,320
Take good care of my mother, don.
- Mother!

1148
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,160
I'm going! - Mother!

1149
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,400
Take good care of my mother, don.

1150
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:20,080
Mother! - Mother!

1151
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,080
I'm saved!
- "You've driven me crazy.."

1152
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:25,440
Babu - "You've driven me crazy.."

1153
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,200
"You've driven me crazy.."

1154
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,600
Aren't you ashamed, naked guy!

1155
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,920
I'm dying at the don's hand
and you're talking a bath out here.

1156
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,200
Get out!
Bring all of them to the airport.

1157
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,000
In the meanwhile,
I'll get the boarding pass. C'mon!

1158
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,200
Who's this? - It's me, brother.

1159
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,560
How are you? - I am fine.

1160
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:47,360
I had something to tell you.
- Yes, tell me. - I've chosen a guy.

1161
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,720
A really nice guy.

1162
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,400
I want you to meet him.

1163
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,720
Yes, I do have to meet him.

1164
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:57,280
I'm bringing him and his dad.
Even I want to show him..

1165
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,560
..that my brother
is a big businessman too.

1166
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:02,800
Very good! Very good!

1167
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,320
When are you coming?
- What do you mean when?

1168
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,440
I'm calling from the airport..
I'm coming right now.

1169
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,040
'Mr. Black.'

1170
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,280
Brother Gopi, please save me..

1171
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,640
What's this new story now?

1172
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,800
Brother Gopi,
I have a sister who studies abroad.

1173
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,320
Whatever I do,
I do it for her, brother Gopi.

1174
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,080
She is getting engaged.

1175
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,360
And they want to come here.

1176
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:39,080
Brother Gopi,
they think that I am a rich person.

1177
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:42,760
That I have many hotels.
But the truth is I have nothing.

1178
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,080
If the groom's family comes
to know that I have nothing..

1179
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,680
..the engagement will break.

1180
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:57,120
Please save me.
- Buddy, I understood everything.

1181
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,840
Brother Kishan,
I understood everything.

1182
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,320
But you will come
to Hoshiarpur with me..

1183
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,600
..once everything becomes fine,
won't you?

1184
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,720
You have faith on me. I have
complete faith in lord Hanuman.

1185
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,440
I'll try to do something.

1186
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,680
These two guys are here as well?

1187
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,200
Kishan.

1188
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,120
Hi. - Hi.

1189
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,400
They are here. - Who is where?

1190
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,280
Ladla. - Whose ladla (dear one)?

1191
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,840
No body's dear one.
Ladla is his name.

1192
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,680
And you know he is a don. A don.
- How would he harm you?

1193
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,320
And why would he do that?
- Look..

1194
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,480
..I don't have time
to answer so many questions.

1195
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,080
He will kill me
the moment he sees me.

1196
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:04,080
He will kill you?
Why, Kishan? - Not Kishan, but Hari.

1197
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,520
Hari ran away with their diamonds.

1198
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:09,320
And these guys are chasing me.
- Then tell those guys..

1199
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,920
..that you are not Hari,
but you are Kishan.

1200
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,040
There's a lot of
difference between..

1201
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,360
..saying something
and proving something, Anu.

1202
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,520
Till I don't bring Hari in
front of them, they will think..

1203
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,720
..that I am Hari
and they will chase me.

1204
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,040
And you know I am Kishan.
And I can't bring Hari here.

1205
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,320
No. - That's why
they will kill Kishan..

1206
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,640
..assuming him to be Hari.
What would happen finally?

1207
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,520
What would happen?
- Finally what will happen is that..

1208
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,640
..Kishan will die in Hari's
place in this diamond puzzle.

1209
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:34,040
And when Hari will be
caught Kishan won't be there.

1210
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,080
Because they had already
killed Kishan. - Yes.

1211
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,600
I hope you understand
what I am saying.

1212
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,320
It's a bit confusing.
- Hari's well-wisher!

1213
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,160
What are you explaining to her?
Explain it to me.

1214
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,280
What! - Now I got it.

1215
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,520
Hari ran away with my diamonds.
- Correct.

1216
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,120
Now you will hand over Hari to me.

1217
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,320
Or else in this hurry
I might shoot you..

1218
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,920
..assuming you to be Hari.

1219
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,120
Will I get a chance? - What chance?

1220
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,600
What's the time now? - Where?

1221
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,320
In your watch, of course.
- It's 2 o'clock.

1222
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,440
2? - 2.

1223
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:06,000
He might have gone to Bali by now.
- Bali? - Bali?

1224
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,440
Yes, it's his daily program. - What?

1225
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,360
He meets Kali at 1 o'clock.
He goes to Bali at 2. - Bali.

1226
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,160
There he eats a rice plate at 3.

1227
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,320
I want to go to Bali.
- Do I look like a travel agent?

1228
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,040
Let's do one thing.
Let's go to the port.

1229
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:20,680
You can catch him there
before he leaves this place.

1230
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,520
If he escapes to Bali you'd
be left with empty hands. - No.

1231
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,040
I will go to Bali. - Thank you.

1232
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,760
I will go to Bali.
I won't go bankrupt.

1233
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:34,360
C'mon! Be careful. Be careful.
There's a gun in my hand.

1234
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,680
Be careful. - Yes.

1235
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,800
Yes, come.

1236
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:41,840
Walk faster or else
the ship will leave.

1237
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,720
Is this is the right ship
or you are pulling a fast one?

1238
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,400
You think I am pulling
a fast one on you?

1239
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:50,280
What are you saying!
He's there. - Who?

1240
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,120
Hari. Hari. He's there.

1241
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,880
Red cap and red jacket.
- Red cap. Red jacket.

1242
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,280
I can see him.
- He is his mother's favorite child.

1243
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,760
He's his mother's
favorite child. Really!

1244
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,160
Stop. - Hey! I am here.

1245
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:08,920
I can do it for you.
I am as good as three. Wait here.

1246
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,840
Stop. You think I am a fool? - No.

1247
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:15,240
We will be here. You will go there.

1248
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:18,920
You will escape to Bali
with your brother Hari.

1249
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,920
You wait here. We will go there.

1250
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,960
Come. Come.
- Be careful. Be careful.

1251
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:26,560
Ok. Hide your face.

1252
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,080
Down. Down.

1253
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,200
Whoever is there in the
red coat will get Hari's death.

1254
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:45,880
Move aside.

1255
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:56,920
Something is definitely
wrong. Freak!

1256
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,400
Nothing's wrong, Anu.
I am here only, isn't it?

1257
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,960
See I am the owner of this hotel.

1258
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:05,040
But this owner will disown
the ownership for a month.

1259
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,280
K.G. Resort will become G.K.
Resort..

1260
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:12,280
..whose owners will
be Gopi and Kishan.

1261
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,560
'Hey Mr. Black! '

1262
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,400
'Hey Mr. White.'

1263
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:46,200
'Hey Mr. White, Mr. Black! '

1264
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,280
I have been pushing around
the suitcases since 25 years..

1265
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,760
..but I didn't get
to wear a suit even once.

1266
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,560
And this stick-man
came here half-naked..

1267
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:01,600
..but today he is roaming
around like a big shot.

1268
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,400
How are you? - Brother.

1269
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,120
O God! Good to see you.

1270
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,400
Brother, he is Sid. - Sid, hi. - Hi.

1271
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:11,360
And he is Sid's dad,
Mr. Vikrant Patel.

1272
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,880
Greetings. - It's alright.

1273
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,920
Very nice to have met you, Kishan.
- Pleasure's all mine.

1274
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,360
Please meet my friends.
Please, come.

1275
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:22,640
He's my partner, Mr. Gopi.
- Greetings.

1276
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,040
How do you do, Mr. Gopi?

1277
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,320
What are you doing?

1278
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,720
Awesome. Awesome look.

1279
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,080
Very interesting. Stick. - Yeah.

1280
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:34,520
Yeah. Yeah.
- And she's Tanya, our employer.

1281
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,640
Hello there! - Employer?

1282
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,520
Its owner. - Owner.

1283
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:41,000
Yeah. - Actually Mr. Gopi
and Tanya are, you know..

1284
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,920
In love. - Yeah! Yeah!

1285
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,120
And she is Anuradha.
She and I.. Actually she's my owner.

1286
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,800
Shall we go now? Shall we? - Yeah..

1287
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,000
Please come.

1288
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,160
Yeah!

1289
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,120
Thank you.

1290
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,200
What is going on!
You changed the hotel's name..

1291
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,480
You even changed the owner's name.

1292
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,600
What's the matter, Roshan Lal?

1293
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:52,120
Tanya ma'am, you are corrupting
your family business.

1294
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,480
Everything will be ruined.

1295
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,280
I mean there will
be no credibility left.

1296
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,800
Why don't you understand that?

1297
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,280
Look, Roshan Lal. It would
be far better if you don't bother..

1298
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:02,120
..to lecture me about family
business and credibility, ok?

1299
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,320
Or else I will also
have to lecture your wife..

1300
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:07,000
..about your relation
with that Suzie girl.

1301
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,200
Should I, Roshan Lal? - Ma'am.

1302
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,440
Suzie.

1303
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:21,080
Gopi and Kishan
are such good people.

1304
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:22,440
I am really happy.

1305
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:49,320
"Two heartbeats of the same heart."

1306
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:52,000
"One is Gopi and the
other one is Kishan."

1307
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,920
"Two heartbeats of the same heart."

1308
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,680
"One is Gopi and the
other one is Kishan."

1309
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:07,760
"Come. Come. Welcome. Welcome."

1310
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:13,440
"Come. Come. Welcome. Welcome."

1311
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:20,760
"Two heartbeats of the same heart."

1312
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:23,520
"One is Gopi and the
other one is Kishan."

1313
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,040
"Two heartbeats of the same heart."

1314
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,000
"One is Gopi and the
other one is Kishan."

1315
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,200
"It is unbreakable.."

1316
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:36,800
"It is unbreakable..
Our bond is unbreakable."

1317
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:41,840
"Come. Come. Welcome. Welcome."

1318
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:46,960
"Come. Come. Welcome. Welcome."

1319
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:23,200
"Our story is very
unique and beautiful."

1320
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,360
"We are two bodies, but one soul."

1321
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:33,800
"Our story is very
unique and beautiful."

1322
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:39,200
"We are two bodies, but one soul."

1323
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,920
"We will stay together forever."

1324
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,520
"We will sacrifice
our lives for each other."

1325
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:47,440
"We'll share the sorrows."

1326
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,640
"Welcome. Welcome. Welcome."

1327
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:57,760
"Welcome. Welcome. Welcome."

1328
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:39,760
"We have taken an oath,
we will surely keep the promise."

1329
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:45,080
"We will enjoy the
togetherness of love."

1330
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:50,280
"We have taken an oath,
we will surely keep the promise."

1331
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:55,440
"We will enjoy the
togetherness of love."

1332
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:00,360
"God brought us together.
Brought happiness in our life."

1333
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:03,280
"We will dance with joy."

1334
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:13,520
"Dance with joy. Dance with joy."

1335
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,120
"Two heartbeats of the same heart."

1336
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,760
"One is Gopi and the
other one is Kishan."

1337
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:21,520
"Two heartbeats of the same heart."

1338
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,360
"One is Gopi and the
other one is Kishan."

1339
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:26,680
"It is unbreakable.."

1340
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:32,040
"It is unbreakable..
Our bond is unbreakable."

1341
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:37,200
"Bond."

1342
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:42,600
"Bond."

1343
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:47,840
"Bond."

1344
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:52,920
"Bond."

1345
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:58,160
"Bond."

1346
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:03,520
"Bond."

1347
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,840
I've never seen you
so happy before, dad.

1348
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:20,120
Yes, son. We Indians go
far away and change ourselves..

1349
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:25,880
..but the India inside
this heart never changes.

1350
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,360
It is a great thing for this
Indian heart to feel happy when..

1351
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,720
..our son or daughter
is wed to a good Indian family.

1352
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:36,080
It's a great thing. It is
the happiest moment of our life.

1353
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:39,400
I was confident, dad.
After talking to Divya, one can..

1354
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,840
..definitely understand
that she is from a royal family.

1355
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:45,280
Brother Gopi,
the engagement ceremony was..

1356
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:46,520
..a super hit one.

1357
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:50,360
Yes, instead of wearing this suit,
if I would've worn my..

1358
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:53,200
..loin cloth, then it would've
looked grand and pomp. You..

1359
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:59,400
Phone.. - Here.

1360
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:04,840
Who is it?
Three of them? Okay, send them in.

1361
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:07,760
Journalists.

1362
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,200
Hello.. - Hello, sir.

1363
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,080
Hello, who are you?

1364
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,280
I am Khabri from Dopahri.

1365
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:18,080
I am Miss Sting from Twing channel.

1366
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,400
And I am from Daily Danga.

1367
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:21,280
Good. What made you come here?

1368
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,080
Sir, we've come
here for an interview.

1369
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,600
Oh, how sad, there isn't
any vacancy here. Get out.

1370
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:28,040
Sir, we want to interview you.

1371
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:30,760
You've got such a big deal,
you took over this hotel..

1372
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:33,280
We want to know everything
how you did all this, sir.

1373
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,720
Do you want to know everything?

1374
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,280
No problem. There is a room here.
We'll go there.

1375
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,840
We'll wrap up the interview.

1376
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:48,960
I think I've seen you somewhere.

1377
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:53,320
Right now. When you were
looking there and turned here..

1378
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,480
..you must've seen me. Come, sir.

1379
01:37:55,560 --> 01:38:00,520
One minute.
There is something wrong in this..

1380
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:04,680
..name plate of the resort.
- Name plate? Not at all.

1381
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,080
How did it become GK from KG?

1382
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:11,640
The owner has changed
so the name also changed.

1383
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:14,080
What are you saying?
The owner has changed? - Yes.

1384
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:15,200
Who is the owner now?

1385
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:24,640
You? You both are
owners of this resort?

1386
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,800
Why did he come here?
- He used to wear a loin cloth..

1387
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,840
..and Mittal got you
released from the jail.

1388
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:31,120
I was undergoing punishment
because of your confusion.

1389
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,440
By the way you slowly
digested that..

1390
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:33,800
..five hundred thousand rupees.

1391
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,640
Punishment? - Yes,
this inspector is always confused.

1392
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:39,160
Shut up!
There is no confusion today.

1393
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,080
If there isn't any confusion,
why are you here?

1394
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:42,520
Did you forget the
way to the police station?

1395
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,080
Or you have come here
for the extortion money?

1396
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,280
Look, I am a very good citizen
of this country and I will not..

1397
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:48,160
..encourage this kind
of illegal activities.

1398
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:50,040
Extortion money? - Yes.

1399
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:51,720
I am not here for
the extortion money.

1400
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:55,120
I am here to investigate two things.
- Oh, tell me.

1401
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:58,000
How did the name of this
resort change from KG to GK?

1402
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:00,840
Three journalists are
missing from this place.

1403
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:04,520
Missing? But I..
- Newspaper is shut down?

1404
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:05,640
Newspaper is on.

1405
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,920
So, are you unaware of the
fact that we bought this hotel?

1406
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,280
Bought it? - Yes, do you
think I would've taken it on rent?

1407
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:13,720
GK.. Gopi Kishan resort.
Hello. - Hello.

1408
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:16,440
There is something fishy.
- There's nothing fishy.

1409
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,000
We both are 50-50 partners.

1410
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,080
Three people are missing from here.

1411
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:24,520
Mr. Khabri, Mr. Panga,
and Ms. Sting.

1412
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:27,600
Two men and one girl are missing.

1413
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,080
Girl will surely miss a guy, right?

1414
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:32,920
They are not missing each other,
but three people are missing..

1415
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,320
..from here, since last night.
They had come here.

1416
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,600
Who told this to you? - James.

1417
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,400
Who, James? - Senior producer X TV.

1418
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:44,440
Did he say that? - He didn't say,
but gave a complaint.

1419
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,440
Whose? - Journalist.

1420
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:49,000
There is a complaint about the
journalist, why are you asking me?

1421
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:51,280
Strange?
- There was a complaint that..

1422
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,280
..three journalists
are missing from here.

1423
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,280
But we didn't complain from here.

1424
01:39:56,360 --> 01:40:02,480
Oh God, here means..
three journalists from this resort..

1425
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:06,280
..are missing. This complaint
was given by senior producer..

1426
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:10,080
..X TV Mr.
James in the police station.

1427
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:11,280
You.. - Hey, shut up!

1428
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,440
That's why I have
come here to investigate.

1429
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:17,680
For such a small matter.
For such a small matter. Go search.

1430
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,960
No! No! - Why not?

1431
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,680
Brother Kishan.. - Brother?

1432
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:27,360
So, he is your brother?
- No, he addresses everyone..

1433
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,360
..as 'brother' with love.
- Is that so?

1434
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,880
Brother inspector.. - Brother
inspector? My name is Brown.

1435
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,640
Brother Brown..
- Don't address me as brother!

1436
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,240
Okay, just brother will do? - No.

1437
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:39,600
Brother.
Brother. Brother. - No! No! No!

1438
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:46,360
Oh, Mr. No! - My name is Brown.
Call me inspector Brown!

1439
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,920
Okay.. Why are you getting angry?

1440
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,000
You shouldn't get angry so easily.

1441
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:52,160
Relax, there is some confusion.

1442
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,000
I'll explain everything
to you in brief.

1443
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,320
Not three,
but two journalists had come here.

1444
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:59,880
Both were girls. One named
Khabri and other named Sting.

1445
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,760
There was a problem
between both of them.

1446
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,600
Brother Gopi got angry
and kicked them out of here.

1447
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,200
Since then they are missing.
- Missing? - Yes.

1448
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:09,640
From where? - Here.

1449
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:14,440
I am saying the same thing.
- Even I am saying the same thing.

1450
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,080
Then who is confused? - James.

1451
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:20,320
Who is James?
- James is the producer of X TV.

1452
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:23,120
Oh, I remember it now.
- He gave the complaint, right?

1453
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:26,640
Yes, he gave a complaint
that there are three..

1454
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,320
..journalists missing
from GK resort.

1455
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:35,360
Did he say GK or KG?
- He was addressing as GK and..

1456
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:39,320
..I was saying KG.
- Then who was confused?

1457
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:46,080
I was confused. - Strange. Strange.

1458
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:49,640
You've been saying from a
long time that no one is confused.

1459
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:54,000
Babu.. Babu! Babu. - Yes, sir.

1460
01:41:54,400 --> 01:42:00,720
Babu, Babu.. take him and
leave him far away from this place.

1461
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,800
Yes, sir. - Far away.
- Come on, sir. - Strange.

1462
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,640
In that jungle - Kishan..

1463
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,240
From where no one returns.

1464
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:09,640
Very good!

1465
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:17,000
Hey, come here!

1466
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:20,200
No rooms. Hotel full. Go.

1467
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:22,920
It seems you are new.

1468
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,440
You are teaching me my own business!

1469
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:28,840
I'm Kulbhushan Gupta.

1470
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:31,120
You may be Kulbhushan
or Bharat Bhushan..

1471
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:31,960
..I don't care.

1472
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:33,360
C'mon move away from here.

1473
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:34,640
Hey, you do not recognise the owner!

1474
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:35,840
And on top of that you act smart!

1475
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,320
Hey, you may be the owner
of your house, understood?

1476
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,080
If you talk too much then..

1477
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:43,920
It seems some mad
dog has bitten you!

1478
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,160
A mad dog has bitten me? - Yes.

1479
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:47,440
I will show you now.

1480
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:49,640
One minute.

1481
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:58,040
Hey, go.. get out!

1482
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:00,840
Fool, idiot!

1483
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:10,120
Tight slap! Wait till
I make a bed roll out of you!

1484
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,080
Hey he's taking me somewhere!

1485
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:14,680
I'm the owner of this resort!

1486
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:16,880
Shut up!
- I'm the owner of this resort!

1487
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,560
Whatever you are, I'll show you now!

1488
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:19,800
Can't you understand?

1489
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,000
You fool!

1490
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,440
G.K. Resorts!

1491
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:29,600
Hey, you've landed
directly on earth?!

1492
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,080
Did you get struck by lightening?

1493
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:33,160
Who are you?

1494
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:35,440
I'm the owner of this resort.

1495
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,000
What? - Yes.

1496
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:40,240
When a beggar says
that I can understand..

1497
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:42,240
..but when I see a lunatic,
it makes me angry..

1498
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:43,880
..I'm telling you.

1499
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:45,040
Hey I'm not a lunatic!

1500
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:48,440
Then? - I'm the owner
of this resort. K.G.

1501
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:50,640
You study in K. G? - Oh!

1502
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:53,320
In your place, I'd have
graduated five times by now!

1503
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:57,360
He's in K. G!
- K.G. Stands for Kulbhushan Gupta.

1504
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,280
Okay, okay, okay,
so you are that K.G.

1505
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,560
And these people are fooling you.

1506
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:10,520
You know them?
- I know everything about them.

1507
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:11,760
Is it? - Yes.

1508
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,200
You can reach them through me..

1509
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:17,040
..and you can even
get them arrested.

1510
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:22,360
But there is a price for
taking my help. 10,000 only.

1511
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:28,200
99.. 100.. 10,000 complete.

1512
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:30,080
Let's go. - Come here.

1513
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:34,680
10,000 rupees just to
bring me to the police station?

1514
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,200
You first come inside.

1515
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:39,040
Great K. G!
Sold your hotel for millions..

1516
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:40,600
..distributed sweets
to the entire world..

1517
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:42,280
..and only then
you remembered Brown!

1518
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:43,360
What sweets sir?

1519
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:46,520
His hotel is not sold, it's stolen.

1520
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,720
Stolen? - Yes. - Who stole it?

1521
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,600
And who are you? - Tulsi.

1522
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:54,920
Tulsi? - Yes.

1523
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:57,680
I have heard this name somewhere.

1524
01:44:57,880 --> 01:44:59,280
Where have I heard it?

1525
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:01,400
Where have I heard this name?

1526
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:02,880
In the TV serial.

1527
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,760
The TV serial,
'Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi'..

1528
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:09,760
..the name of the heroine
in that serial is Tulsi.

1529
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:12,640
Then what is your name? - Tulsi.

1530
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:14,200
Then what is the name of that Irani?

1531
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:16,120
I told you sir, Tulsi.

1532
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:20,280
You are trying to confuse me.

1533
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:21,760
Don't confuse me!

1534
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,920
Hey Brown! Brown!

1535
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:28,680
My mother! Listen to me!
Why are you listening to him?

1536
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:32,560
My hotel is destroyed,
I'm destroyed.

1537
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:34,800
They have stolen my hotel!

1538
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:36,600
They have turned K. G into G.K.

1539
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:42,480
Where were you when
all this was happening?

1540
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,000
What do you mean where I was?
I was on a tour.

1541
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,040
Were you on a small
tour or some big tour?

1542
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:52,560
Hey, how does that matter?!

1543
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,760
It matters.

1544
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:59,360
I went to the bathroom in my house..

1545
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:00,680
..and my house was robbed.

1546
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:04,080
You left behind your
hotel and went on a tour..

1547
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:05,520
..your hotel was robbed.

1548
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:10,080
K. G, you are going through
a bad phase just like me.

1549
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:12,760
Forget a 5-star, you are not even..

1550
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,120
..worth owning a roadside joint now.

1551
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:21,640
Now you neither need the police,
me, nor.. - Tulsi.

1552
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:25,520
You neither need Tulsi
nor Aruna Irani. - Smriti Irani.

1553
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:26,840
That.. - Don't confuse me.

1554
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:31,400
Listen to me,
forget a complaint and..

1555
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:35,160
..show your horoscope
to some good astrologer.

1556
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,360
You're going through a bad phase.

1557
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:39,640
Oh my God!
What kind of a man is he!

1558
01:47:06,280 --> 01:47:08,840
"Dance, sing and have fun."

1559
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:11,080
"Come and enjoy yourselves."

1560
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:14,160
"The ambience is full of happiness."

1561
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:16,560
"Dance to the beat of the music."

1562
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:19,080
"Hey dance, sing and have fun."

1563
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,800
"Come and enjoy yourselves."

1564
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:24,800
"The ambience is full of happiness."

1565
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:27,080
"Dance to the beat of the music."

1566
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:31,960
"There is freedom to drink and eat."

1567
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:37,120
"Friends,
it's my sister's marriage."

1568
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:43,280
"Friends,
it's my sister's marriage."

1569
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:09,600
"My sister's face
is like a golden bird."

1570
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:14,840
"Nobody's sister in this
world is like my sister."

1571
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:17,520
"Like a jewel. - Are her eyes."

1572
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,120
"Like a pearl.. - Are her eyes."

1573
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:22,800
"She is natures.. - Magic."

1574
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:25,680
"She seems like.. - A fairy."

1575
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:33,000
"Is she a bride or some queen?"

1576
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:38,120
"Friends, it's my sister's..
sister's marriage."

1577
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:44,520
"Friends,
it's my sister's marriage."

1578
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:26,400
"Sister, you take away
your brother's good wishes."

1579
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:31,760
"Let there be no
sadness in your life."

1580
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,440
"This day was destined to come."

1581
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:37,040
"You have to go to
your beloved's house."

1582
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:39,720
"No matter how hard we try.."

1583
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:43,080
"..tears are bound to flow."

1584
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:49,640
"Everyone has helped
decorate your palanquin."

1585
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:54,960
"Friends,
it's my sister's marriage."

1586
01:49:55,040 --> 01:50:00,680
"Friends it's my sister's marriage."

1587
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:03,760
"Hey dance, sing and have fun."

1588
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:06,360
"Come on enjoy yourselves."

1589
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:09,120
"The ambience is full of happiness."

1590
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:11,400
"Dance to the eat of the music."

1591
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:16,200
"There is freedom to drink and eat."

1592
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:21,600
"Friends,
it's my sister's marriage."

1593
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:27,160
"Friends it's my sister's marriage."

1594
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:32,080
"Friends it's my sister's marriage."

1595
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:37,320
"Friends it's my sister's marriage."

1596
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:42,680
"Friends it's my sister's marriage."

1597
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:49,520
"Friends it's my sister's marriage."

1598
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:00,400
We'll find some clue..

1599
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:02,320
..what this racket is about.

1600
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:05,240
KG, what will people say
when they see us entering like..

1601
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:07,840
..thieves in the hotel to
look for thieves with an inspector?

1602
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:10,240
They'll think that thief
has come in the disguise of..

1603
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,800
..an inspector or inspector
in the disguise of thief.

1604
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:23,720
Come. Come.
Keep your confusion away and..

1605
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:25,440
..come with me quietly.

1606
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:32,320
Sir.. - Sir, please, save us.
- Sir please, help us.

1607
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:33,680
We had come for an interview.

1608
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,280
What is our fault?
We're media persons.

1609
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:41,840
They beat us up badly.

1610
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,120
We are not giving
you any great news.

1611
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:47,200
It is not Gopi Kishan
who has done it, but it is me.

1612
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:50,760
Till today,
this hotel belongs to you, dad.

1613
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:53,880
The name and the owner
were changed for some days.

1614
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:55,240
That's it. - That's it?!

1615
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:58,200
Such a big fraud and
it is a small thing for you?

1616
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:02,520
Possessiveness of a brother
to his sister.. a brother's love..

1617
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,240
..you call this as fraud, dad?

1618
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,240
This is the first time in my life.

1619
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:07,960
I've known the importance
of relationships.

1620
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,840
The price of your hotel
is nothing compared to that.

1621
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:13,320
You can keep the
hotel for yourself, dad.

1622
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:16,240
It was KG resort earlier,
even today it is yours and..

1623
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,440
..you will remain
its owner forever.

1624
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:28,600
Tulsi, there is a chaos all around.

1625
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:32,920
All the rich people
have become poor here.

1626
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:38,320
Even I say, don't be greedy.
Stop stealing.

1627
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:42,640
Tulsi, I am telling you,
your taxi is best for you.

1628
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:47,040
Even if you earn daily, you
will earn a huge amount. Lottery.

1629
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:56,240
Lottery. You've won a lottery,
Tulsi. You've won a lottery.

1630
01:52:57,160 --> 01:53:01,080
Tulsi, you've become a millionaire.

1631
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:04,960
Brother Gopi, you accompanied
me as my elder brother.

1632
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:09,320
Our sister got married.
Divya is very fortunate.

1633
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:13,360
She had only one brother
earlier now she has two.

1634
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:15,440
Now even I have a brother now.

1635
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:19,440
Brother, Kishan. If you
address me as your elder brother..

1636
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:21,440
..then please listen to me.

1637
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:27,120
If one is not greedy and
pure at heart, God favors them.

1638
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:32,000
You've fulfilled your wish, right?

1639
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:36,520
Now, I'll do what I wish.
- Yes. - But..

1640
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:39,360
First you'll come with
me to Hoshiarpur and I'll do..

1641
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,240
..whatever you want me to do.

1642
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:45,200
If you escape from us,
you'll leave this place. You!

1643
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:48,040
Hey, listen.

1644
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:50,080
Hey you!
You were trying to cheat me!

1645
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:53,920
Hey brother!
- Brother! Don't call me brother.

1646
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:56,520
This story took me to Bali!

1647
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:58,920
I don't want a story,
I want the diamonds!

1648
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:00,880
Bali? Brother! Diamonds?

1649
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:02,520
Brother, which diamonds
are you talking about?

1650
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:06,080
Don't ask me, ask him.
By the way, who are you?

1651
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:08,120
Consider me as his elder brother.

1652
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:12,320
Who are you? Whose brother are you?
Twins, elder, younger?

1653
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:13,640
Not twins, but elder.

1654
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:16,520
But he said twin,
he is elder and he is younger.

1655
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,040
One minute, I'll ask him.

1656
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:20,160
Brother Kishan, who is younger one?

1657
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:23,240
I am younger and you are elder.
- Shut up!

1658
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:25,120
You said that you were
elder and he was younger.

1659
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:28,160
Why are you shouting?
Why are you shouting?

1660
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:30,560
Shouting like this will not change
you to elder and him to younger.

1661
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,920
Don't shout.
I'll ask him with shanti (softly).

1662
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:36,000
Shanti? Who is Shanti?

1663
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:39,560
Shanti means Aman (peace). - Aman?

1664
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:42,120
Tell me one thing clearly,
how many siblings are you?

1665
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:44,360
Gopi, Kishan, Shanti, Aman?

1666
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:47,520
No brother, we are only two of them.
Gopi and this is my Kishan.

1667
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:49,280
Then who is Shanti and Aman?

1668
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,760
You forget them. - Then twins?

1669
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,000
I am asking him about them, right?

1670
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:57,680
Brother Kishan,
tell me who are twins?

1671
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:00,680
Twins? I don't have any
twin brother. - He doesn't have.

1672
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:02,840
You don't interrupt him.
- He is lying.

1673
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:05,000
Then what is the truth?
- He doesn't have any twin brother.

1674
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:09,600
When you know the truth,
why are you tormenting him?

1675
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:13,280
Because his twin brother,
who doesn't exist, has run away..

1676
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:15,240
..with diamonds worth 250 million.

1677
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:16,640
Are you nuts?

1678
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:19,000
What are you saying? His
twin brother, who doesn't exist..

1679
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:21,000
..has run away with your
diamonds worth 250 million?

1680
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:22,240
Yes. He ran away. It means
that it was him who told me..

1681
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:23,680
..about his twin brother
and ran away with..

1682
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,000
..my diamonds worth 250 million.

1683
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:27,760
Ask him where his twin brother is.
That means where is he?

1684
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:29,400
I'll ask you something
that will be final.

1685
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:32,520
What do you want to know?
About the diamonds or brother?

1686
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,360
Shoot brother, I want the diamonds.

1687
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:37,600
If you shoot the brother,
how will you get the diamonds?

1688
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:39,800
Please, give back my diamonds.

1689
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:42,920
Please, calm down.
I'll do something.

1690
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:48,080
Did you take his diamonds?
- No. - Hey, you come down.

1691
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:51,840
You lied to me?
- Sir, I am not lying.

1692
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:54,240
Brother Gopi, I am not lying.
Somebody else has..

1693
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:57,080
..taken his diamonds away from him.
What can I do?

1694
01:55:57,160 --> 01:55:59,640
Brother!
- Those diamonds belong to me!

1695
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:01,960
The whole world knows
that those diamonds are mine.

1696
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:05,280
Give the diamonds to me or
there'll be bloodshed all around.

1697
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:10,400
Yes, even you'll have
to shed your blood, dear.

1698
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:18,760
Hey fraud, will you give
the diamonds or not or these girls..

1699
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:21,680
..and your friends will be seen
only in a photograph from now on.

1700
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:28,000
Come on, give the diamonds
or see these girl dead.

1701
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:31,520
I am his elder brother.
Tell me what do you want?

1702
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:35,920
Hey you! Shut up! Stop acting naive.

1703
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:38,720
This is done by you both.

1704
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,720
Come on, give us the diamonds.
Come on.

1705
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,240
Kishan, why don't
you tell them that this..

1706
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,000
..was done by Hari and not you?

1707
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:55,160
Brother Gopi, I was going to
tell you everything after Divya's..

1708
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:58,040
..wedding about these people.

1709
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:05,920
I was the one who used to lie,
cheat, and swindle.

1710
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:09,840
I don't have any twin brother.

1711
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,440
I had made a place to hide my sins.

1712
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:25,320
Anu, please forgive me.
Please, forgive me.

1713
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:28,600
I never had the courage
to mutter up the truth.

1714
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:33,000
I had a fear of losing you.
I am sorry.

1715
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:35,560
I love you very much.

1716
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:38,920
The diamonds are with me.

1717
01:57:56,720 --> 01:58:00,600
Listen! Apply that!

1718
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:05,440
Apply! Come here!

1719
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:09,920
Apply!

1720
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:13,600
You are tickling me!

1721
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:22,680
You! I will kill you! - Hey!

1722
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:25,400
Hey Sardar!

1723
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,080
How did you enter our room?!

1724
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:31,640
How? - Through the door!

1725
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:33,040
What do you mean how!

1726
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:36,280
If I wouldn't have entered
your room through the door..

1727
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:40,240
..then.. this.. I would
have lost this stuff worth crores.

1728
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,120
Understood? - What is this?

1729
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:47,520
Diamonds. - That means
you are a robber. Thief. Police!

1730
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:48,920
Hey dwarf!

1731
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,920
Hey dwarf!

1732
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,920
Sweets are in front of
you and you are looking elsewhere!

1733
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:01,560
We will share it.
What do you say sister-in-law.

1734
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:06,360
You idiot! Get out! Get out!

1735
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:08,760
Otherwise I will open
all the hooks and shout.

1736
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:11,000
Should I shout?
- No. - Should I shout? - No.

1737
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:14,200
Save me. Save me. Save me.

1738
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,320
Diamonds!

1739
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:19,600
Where are the diamonds?

1740
01:59:19,680 --> 01:59:21,080
Where are the diamonds?

1741
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:24,520
Who's going to wait
for him to recall!

1742
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:27,120
When his beloved
is drenched in blood..

1743
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,720
..he will recall even
his days in the womb!

1744
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,000
One minute! One minute! One minute!

1745
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:32,320
I'm being able to recall something.

1746
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:37,120
Engagement.. marriage.. - Marriage..

1747
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:39,920
..palanquin.. songs.. and..

1748
01:59:40,240 --> 01:59:44,320
Hey short circuit! Sing
the song for your father-in-law!

1749
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:48,320
Give me the diamonds.
Or I'll kill these two old people!

1750
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:49,360
Papa.

1751
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:51,920
Brother Kishan, do you
recall where the diamonds are?

1752
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,520
I am waiting for them.

1753
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:00,040
"Whom are you waiting for,
I'm there."

1754
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:06,360
"Look here once, I'm here."

1755
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:09,320
Hey Sardar, stop your rape!

1756
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:13,080
Hey strong man,
you are trying to say 'rap'!

1757
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:17,520
This is Gujarati!
Your voice is getting raped.

1758
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:20,000
You do one thing. Change your voice.

1759
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:22,920
Don't worry,
I'll pay for the operation.

1760
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:26,120
Hey Sardar,
have you lost your mind?!

1761
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:30,120
Not lost it!
I have realized the truth!

1762
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:32,400
Although I realized
it a little late.

1763
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:35,120
The truth is so evident that..

1764
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:37,120
..there is no question
of any doubts.

1765
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:39,240
The reputation that
had got tattered..

1766
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:41,800
..has been rebuilt again.

1767
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:43,880
In short,
the moral of the story is that..

1768
02:00:43,960 --> 02:00:45,960
..I'm going to be
the owner of this hotel.

1769
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:47,880
Hey, hey Sardar!

1770
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:49,640
There is a question
of life and death here..

1771
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:51,000
..do not interfere!

1772
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:54,960
Come, move aside,
otherwise I'll shoot you first!

1773
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,120
Hey Barbie doll!

1774
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:59,440
Give me those hands,
they would be useful for massage.

1775
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:00,640
Take her, take her away.

1776
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:03,600
Hey I'll take you away too,
you blackie!

1777
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:05,520
Hey Sardar, what are you doing?

1778
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:08,120
Brother Kishan is trying
to recall something.

1779
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:11,160
Why are you interfering
and disturbing his concentration?!

1780
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:14,760
We are all stuck in this world.

1781
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:17,360
But you do not worry,
everyone will be relieved.

1782
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:20,400
Everyone's fate will
change for the better.

1783
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:24,560
Hey Sardar! Get out of
here before your luck runs out!

1784
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:28,560
My luck won't run out,
it will shine!

1785
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:31,280
Look what do I have?!

1786
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:43,920
Brother Kishan, diamonds!

1787
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,120
Diamonds are found!

1788
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:46,120
Hello.

1789
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:05,920
No one will move
beginning from the Sardar!

1790
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:08,520
Drop your guns!

1791
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:11,240
Where? - Don't confuse me!

1792
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:13,680
What do you mean where?
Here in my hands!

1793
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:18,440
C'mon everybody turn around.
- This way!

1794
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:21,120
Now stretch your
hands for the handcuffs.

1795
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:28,440
One handcuff, 12 hands!

1796
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:30,760
Statue!

1797
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:32,960
I will go to the
police station now..

1798
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:34,640
..to get more handcuffs.

1799
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:39,240
Be honest criminals!
Stay here! I'll be back!

1800
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:41,920
K. G - Yes.
- You wait for me near the gate.

1801
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:44,400
And see to it that nobody
goes out from the gate.

1802
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:46,160
Okay. - Follow me.

1803
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:57,760
Leave me!

1804
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,600
Hey leave me! Leave me!

1805
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:01,880
Hey leave, leave!

1806
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:04,160
Leave me! Leave me!

1807
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:13,640
Diamonds!

1808
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:29,320
My mother's diamonds!

1809
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:30,920
They're mine!

1810
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:45,640
Oh No! - Now you can't escape.

1811
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:55,440
Look, I don't hit women. Look..

1812
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:58,520
Make the pyramid properly.
I will climb.

1813
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:12,560
Look, I don't hit women.

1814
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:32,200
Diamonds!

1815
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,200
No! You won't!

1816
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:40,160
Come here. Come here.

1817
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:43,240
I want them.

1818
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,840
Oh no!

1819
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:50,000
I've got it! - Give it to me.

1820
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:52,840
I have got the diamonds!
I have got the diamonds!

1821
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:59,440
Dear! Dear!

1822
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:01,680
Where are you? - Mother.

1823
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:06,200
Mother. Mother, where had you been?

1824
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:10,120
Dear! Where are you?
Get lost from here.

1825
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:17,520
Gopi!

1826
02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:28,360
Hey, where did it go?

1827
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:31,880
Hey, where did it go? - Where?

1828
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,840
Excuse me. - Move back!

1829
02:05:56,720 --> 02:05:59,360
Diamonds! Diamonds!

1830
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:07,360
'Mr. White! Hey Mr. Black! '

1831
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:11,280
Gopi Kishan! Stop!

1832
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:13,720
Stop! Return my diamonds!

1833
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:16,960
Return my diamonds!

1834
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:29,360
'Mr. White! Hey Mr. Black! '

1835
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:34,200
Halt! Halt!

1836
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:53,760
Brother inspector, the one
whom you had to arrest you did.

1837
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:56,960
Now take these diamonds
and deposit them..

1838
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:59,280
..in the government treasury.

1839
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:03,520
Okay. - The reward that
we have to get, keep it as a tip.

1840
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:07,040
Like a gift. - Why should I keep it?

1841
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:10,520
Keep it.
It will be a great use for you.

1842

What is there in your Hoshiarpur..

1844
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,600
..other than this land worth 25,000?
There are only stones in it.

1845
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:25,120
There are no dogs also over here.

1846
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:27,680
Good there are no dogs here!

1847
02:07:28,640 --> 02:07:34,360
Brother Kishan, it is not
worth 25,000, but 250 million.

1848
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:41,960
250 million? Yes! 250 million! Yeah!

"You're my bread
and I'm your spinach."

1853
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:02,360
"Add some butter to it."

1854
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:09,840
"You're my bread and I'm your
spinach. Add some butter to it."

1855
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:13,320

"Forget all differences a hug each
other. Don't lose this opportunity."

1864
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:48,720
"You can try, my brother."

1865
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:52,240

"O little brother, listen to me.
Hold my finger."

"You're naughty, you're innocent.
Get on the bike of friendship."

1871
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:42,320
"I've a great formula to live life."

1872
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:49,560
"I haven't received
this formula for free."

1873
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:53,120
"Who's genuine and who's
an imposter. Who stole the booty?"

1874
02:09:53,200 --> 02:09:56,120
"Drown yourself
in a bucket of water."

1875
02:09:56,160 --> 02:10:03,080
"Don't fight!
Don't fight, brothers."

1876
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:06,320
"Mr. Black, Mr. White!"
