1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,735
It's a good thing to have a towel after a bath, otherwise

2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:03,740
everything dries up.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,740
So this is in the shape of an L.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,880
Like this, like this, and like this.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,019
We got it dug here.

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,220
 

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,839
We'll mix it with manure and leave it like this for a day.

8
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:18,839
We'll get a lot of broccoli and tomatoes here.

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,980
Comment below if you want this too. 20% discount.

10
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,699
Have fun.

11
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:22,479
 

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,359
 

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,459
Mom scolded you?

14
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,700
Why did mom scold you? Mom scolded me.

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,440
Let's ask mom.

16
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,140
Mom, why did you scold me? What did you do?

17
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,799
Aww, Pihu.

18
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,279
You beat mom up?

19
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,719
No, no bad.

20
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:37,119
Two October posts, Sam.

21
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,439
Did you come to meet me at your house?

22
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,000
Not Anji, Swami Chinmayal Anji's satsang.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,799
Today is 22nd September, iPhone 15 has been launched.

24
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,079
We have to go get it.

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,600
We had booked it.

26
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200
I was busy in the morning, I said let's go.

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200
She said we'll go in a little while.

28
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,960
Then I got ready, then she got some work.

29
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,319
Now how will we go, bro?

30
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,319
How will we go, bro?

31
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,679
Think, son, think.

32
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,240
This is what you have to think about.

33
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,719
The World Cup is coming up on 5th October.

34
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,159
I can't miss my cricket practice.

35
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:00,960
It's very important.

36
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,039
We have reached Rashi.

37
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,719
We'll pick Rashi up from school.

38
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,239
This is how you come on the way.

39
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,519
Come fast, come fast.

40
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,840
We're going round and round.

41
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,299
What? We're going round and round.

42
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,480
We used to live in this area.

43
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,480
It's been so many years since we've been here.

44
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,079
It feels good.

45
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,359
We've come to Pacific Mall to get our phone.

46
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,599
And we'll give it to the car in the valet.

47
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,719
It's okay in the valet, it saves a lot of time.

48
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,559
I'll tell you, isn't that the old Eterno?

49
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
I mean, he didn't go in the valet.

50
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,200
All the Audi's were standing there.

51
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,430
Eterno? Eterno was there.

52
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,359
They must have said,

53
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,839
Eterno for 100 rupees, they're giving it for 100 rupees.

54
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,819
Sir, should I keep my helmet too?

55
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Yes, sir, you can keep it.

56
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,239
Look, outside the Apple Store.

57
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,359
It's like getting a free iPhone for 1.5 lakhs.

58
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,400
Oh, man.

59
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,920
Look at this.

60
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,799
Apple First Day.

61
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,799
Look at the crowd, man.

62
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,920
 

63
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,439
All these people have come to buy a new phone today.

64
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,480
We have to wait here.

65
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480
There's a lot of noise outside.

66
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,799
It's a mess.

67
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,839
Sir, I mean, I can't believe that people are so crazy.

68
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,400
To pick up a phone for the first day.

69
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,379
Should we do it like this first?

70
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Let's wear the helmet first.

71
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Sir is going to lose his life.

72
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,379
Do you want to switch it off?

73
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,087
Sir is saying, he won't be able to pick it up from you

74
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:05,587
tomorrow.

75
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

76
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Wear the helmet first.

77
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Here, drink it.

78
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
My 1.5 lakh phone fell.

79
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
I was just kidding.

80
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,490
Sir, if someone opens a new phone, and puts it here, will

81
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:28,990
Apple clear it?

82
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Oh, I got it.

83
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Put it on the table.

84
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
 

85
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
It's like a carpet.

86
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
This is the new cable.

87
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
Both are type C cables.

88
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Apple people change it every time.

89
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,960
There's no on-off button in this one.

90
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
This is Rashid's and this is mine.

91
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Okay?

92
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
It's light.

93
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Zoom goes up to 25x, right?

94
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
No, optical zoom.

95
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
This has 3x.

96
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
This has 5x.

97
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
It's more than that.

98
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
It's digital.

99
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Yes, it's digital.

100
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,500
I thought it has 25x, but sir is saying it's Pro Max.

101
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
I only took Pro.

102
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Pro has 9x and 15x.

103
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Sir, it's possible that if I go out of here,

104
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
and accidentally drop the phone,

105
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
Apple Crypto is here,

106
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
and they upgrade it to Pro Max.

107
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
No.

108
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,520
If someone, for hypothetical purposes, goes to buy Pro Max,

109
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
and gives this as a replacement,

110
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,479
 

111
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
Pro Max will be 20-30% reduction.

112
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,039
Did you see the result of your negligence?

113
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
So, he bought the wrong phone.

114
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,080
 

115
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
512GB.

116
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
We didn't even want 512GB.

117
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
I'm seriously thinking that

118
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
where does he keep his mind?

119
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,080
He said it was some tank influencer.

120
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
It doesn't even have 25x zoom.

121
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
 

122
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,060
And I came to buy it because

123
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
I need more zoom for the video.

124
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,639
Because every time I go,

125
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,639
I change my phone, and it doesn't come from DCI.

126
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,639
 

127
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,639
Basically, he gave it to me.

128
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,639
Gaurav.

129
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,639
Look at this.

130
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,639
You should have tried it once.

131
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,639
And see, it goes up to 25x.

132
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,599
Dad and mom will also watch the video,

133
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,639
and add more.

134
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,639
No, no, no.

135
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,639
 

136
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,639
Why didn't it cut?

137
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,639
Look, the video is up to 15x.

138
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,639
 

139
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,629
 

140
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,639
It's only in the photo, Ritu.

141
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,639
It's in the photo.

142
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,639
Thank you, Apple.

143
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,639
You saved my money.

144
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,639
Dad and mom, don't get angry.

145
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,199
It's the same.

146
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,199
 

147
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
I'm committed towards my fitness goals now.

148
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,212
I'm happy to buy a new phone, but I'm also a little sad

149
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:31,200
that I bought the big one.

150
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,876
In the big one, there is zoom in the photo, but not in the

151
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:35,199
video.

152
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,199
 

153
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,256
But I didn't have to buy the big one because in the big

154
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:40,199
one, there was only 13 Pro Max, which was sold out.

155
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,199
Now it's difficult to keep the big one.

156
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,199
The small one is fine in the pocket.

157
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,200
 

158
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,199
Apple takes so much money from you.

159
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,199
Bro, put a good camera in every phone.

160
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,759
 

161
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,553
The problem is that even if I look outside the store, but

162
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:54,750
there was so much crowd in the store,

163
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,759
the manager of the store said, he is a helpful person,

164
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,759
so he said, sir, don't go out.

165
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,720
Because I said, sir, once I go to buy a phone,

166
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,760
 

167
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,598
Whatever you want, we will bring it inside and give it to

168
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,759
you.
You sit in the back room comfortably.

169
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,170
He is sitting in the back, because of which he was left

170
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,499
behind in life. Anyway, now I'm leaving for cricket

171
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:11,999
coaching.

172
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,759
It's time for me.

173
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,759
My sir is waiting for me there.

174
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,759
I took out my new gloves.

175
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,759
Look at the condition of my old gloves.

176
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,319
The gloves are torn by playing.

177
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,319
When you have someone with you who is torn by playing,

178
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,319
then it is very happy that you have used it.

179
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,319
Bye-bye.

180
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,319
Bye. Love you, sir.

181
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,310
Even the shocker doesn't move in this car, so we move.

182
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,310
By the way,

183
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,319
I have reached my home.

184
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,319
I got a little late today.

185
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,320
 

186
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,310
I parked the car and ran here.

187
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,319
When we were in school, when we came late,

188
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,319
instead of two rounds, three rounds were punished.

189
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,300
Now Gaurav's one more session is about to start.

190
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,319
Let's see how it goes.

191
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,319
In the next episode

192
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,319
A special guest arrives!

193
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,319
We play cricket so well.

194
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,319
Mom, I will also play well.

195
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,310
If you practice,

196
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,319
it's not like that in the air.

197
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,319
What happened to you?

198
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,055
It happened like this, then you are doing it with your

199
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:11,319
hands.
Sir, how are they learning?

200
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,319
A little about them.

201
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,232
We got to know that we have been sending them here for two

202
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:17,319
hours and some outcoming classes

203
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,319
 

204
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,319
What are you saying?

205
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,319
 

206
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,820
Where will he learn cricket at night? We don't understand

207
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,320
such plans of his.

208
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,319
This is his coach.

209
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,319
You are sweating so much.

210
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,300
How is the practice going on?

211
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,300
How is the practice going on?

212
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,319
It's going well.

213
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,319
It was a good session before you came.

214
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,319
Hit it Piyu, hit it.

215
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,319
Hit it Piyu, hit it.

216
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,319
It's such a heavy bat ball.

217
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,319
It's falling down.

218
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:07,319
Very good Piyu, very good.

219
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,319
Piyu, hit the ball.

220
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,319
Very good.

221
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,319
Piyu, hit the ball straight.

222
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,319
Mom, the ball fell down.
