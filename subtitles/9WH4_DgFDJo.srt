1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,056
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,056 --> 00:00:02,435
In 1875,

3
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:06,679
a girl was born in the small town of Arles, France.

4
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,876
Jeanne Louise Calment.

5
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:11,286
It was a time when cars and aeroplanes

6
00:00:11,286 --> 00:00:12,652
were not yet invented.

7
00:00:12,652 --> 00:00:15,225
People used to travel by horse-drawn carriages.

8
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:19,017
People used candles to light their homes.

9
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:21,820
At this time, no human being in the world

10
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,335
would have even dreamt

11
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:26,174
that this girl would make history.

12
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:28,263
She will live such a long life

13
00:00:28,263 --> 00:00:29,994
such a long life

14
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:32,775
that she will break all the world records.

15
00:00:34,278 --> 00:00:36,987
In 1889, Louise was only 14 years old

16
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:40,203
when the Eiffel Tower was built in Paris.

17
00:00:40,203 --> 00:00:41,807
In 1896,

18
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:43,866
when Louise got married at the age of 21,

19
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:47,507
Mahatma Gandhi had just moved to South Africa.

20
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:49,319
By the way, Mahatma Gandhi

21
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:51,563
was only 6 years older than Lewis.

22
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:54,780
Fast forward to 1914,

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,116
when Louise was only 39 years old,

24
00:00:57,116 --> 00:00:59,095
and was living a happily married life

25
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:00,608
and had a daughter.

26
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:03,092
A huge explosion shook Europe.

27
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:05,541
World War I began.

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,311
In 1934,

29
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:13,447
when Hitler's rise was being seen in Germany,

30
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:16,826
there was an unfortunate tragedy in Louise's family.

31
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,027
Her daughter died of a lung infection.

32
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:22,272
She was 59 years old then.

33
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:24,181
59 is an age when

34
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:27,174
most women have become grandmothers.

35
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:29,463
But Louise herself would have never imagined

36
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:32,981
that her life was not even half complete.

37
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:37,413
In 1942, World War II was in full rage in Europe.

38
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:39,357
Millions of people lost their lives in this war.

39
00:01:39,357 --> 00:01:42,093
Millions of people were separated from their families.

40
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:44,602
And something similar happened at Louise's home too.

41
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:46,210
When she was 64 years old,

42
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,034
she lost her husband.

43
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:52,014
In 1947, Prime Minister Nehru hoisted the flag of independent India.

44
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:54,583
India gained independence from the British.

45
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:57,060
Louise was 72 years old at that time.

46
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,151
And she was watching the pages of history turning, unknowingly.

47
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:04,859
In her life, horses were replaced by cars,

48
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,682
and candles by electricity.

49
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:10,490
In 1969, when she celebrated her 94th birthday,

50
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,758
humans stepped on the moon.

51
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,953
"One small step for man,

52
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:17,253
A giant leap for mankind."

53
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:18,789
In 1985,

54
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:21,871
Rajiv Gandhi got a historic victory in the Indian elections.

55
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:26,298
In India, the IT revolution was just about to begin.

56
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:29,091
At that time, Louise was 110 years old.

57
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:31,705
She was happily living in her house till now,

58
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:33,271
but after this point,

59
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:35,593
she moved to a nursing home.

60
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:36,933
In 1988,

61
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:39,357
the world finally started to pay attention to Louise.

62
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:41,692
She was being discussed everywhere,

63
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:47,652
she was in the news for being the oldest living human.

64
00:02:47,652 --> 00:02:51,181
In 1997, at the age of 122,

65
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:52,913
when Louise passed away,

66
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:57,420
the age of computers and the internet had already begun.

67
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,076
Jeanne Louise Calment

68
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:01,793
crossed all the limits of imagination.

69
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:03,620
She made a record that

70
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,619
no one has ever been able to break yet.

71
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:06,960
What was the reason behind it?

72
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,289
What is the secret of living such a long life?

73
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,061
Let's find out in today's video.

74
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:22,317
The first thing that comes to your mind is that

75
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:24,905
obviously, luck was involved.

76
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,201
This is true,

77
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:28,378
if you want to live for 122 years,

78
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:30,528
you will need a lot of luck.

79
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:32,582
But the question here is that

80
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:34,256
in living such a long life,

81
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,384
how much contribution is of luck

82
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:39,395
and how much of it is your lifestyle choices?

83
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:41,606
Between 1870 and 1900,

84
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:45,462
scientific research was conducted in Denmark on twins.

85
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:48,233
More than 2,800 twins were analyzed

86
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:50,647
to study longevity and to see,

87
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,693
how big is genetics as a factor

88
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:55,862
and how big are lifestyle and environment as factors.

89
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:59,648
This research was known as the famous Danish twin study.

90
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:01,269
And the conclusion of this was that

91
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:02,912
an average human's life

92
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:06,248
is 20% dictated by genes

93
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:10,640
and 80% is influenced by lifestyle and environment.

94
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,219
That means your food choices,

95
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,621
the way you exercise

96
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,077
and a healthy lifestyle

97
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:17,195
has a huge impact

98
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:19,040
on how long you will live.

99
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,575
And a big impact of all these factors is on your hair.

100
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:24,562
To some extent, hair loss is natural

101
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:26,853
and it depends on genetics along with age.

102
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:29,632
But to some extent, it also depends on your lifestyle.

103
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:33,038
Medically, hair loss is categorised into 7 stages.

104
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:34,642
If you are in between stages 1 to 4,

105
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,278
then it can be controlled

106
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:37,844
after identifying the root cause.

107
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,124
But if you are beyond stage 5,

108
00:04:40,124 --> 00:04:43,268
then it becomes more difficult to get your hair back.

109
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:46,904
Then risky and expensive surgical procedures like hair transplants,

110
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:48,361
remain the only options.

111
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:50,440
So, if you are in between stages 1 and 4,

112
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,458
it's not too late

113
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,384

You can check it out.

140
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,719
Now, let's get back to the topic.

141
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,364
The next question is,

142
00:05:57,364 --> 00:05:59,515
what are the healthy lifestyle choices

143
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:02,010
that can help you live a long life?

144
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,481
The best way to figure this out is perhaps to

145
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:06,738
do a reverse research.

146
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:08,645
To see the lifestyle of those

147
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:10,727
who are already living for such a long time.

148
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:12,951
In the early 2000s, Dan Buettner,

149
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:16,353
an explorer and author, was working for National Geographic.

150
00:06:16,353 --> 00:06:19,657
He decided to study such places in the world

151
00:06:19,657 --> 00:06:21,977
where people live the longest.

152
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:24,092
In 2003, he collaborated with

153
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,215
anthropologists, historians, dietitians, and geneticists

154
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:28,878
to complete this mission.

155
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:31,099
They used population data

156
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,115
to locate such areas in the world

157
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:37,930
where the most number people of ages 100 and above are found.

158
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,393
These people are called centenarians because

159
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:41,840
they have lived a century.

160
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,105
Around this time, some other people were also researching the same thing.

161
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,077
Like this research paper

162
00:06:47,077 --> 00:06:48,459
that was published in

163
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:50,726
the Journal of Experimental Gerontology.

164
00:06:50,726 --> 00:06:52,340
Here, they identified that

165
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,093
in the Sardinia region of Italy,

166
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:58,062
the highest concentration of male centenarians is found.

167
00:06:58,062 --> 00:07:00,232
Those who are 100 years or above.

168
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:03,864
The Italian villages with the highest concentration of these people,

169
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:06,661
were marked by blue circles on the map.

170
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:09,961
These places were referred to as the Blue Zone.

171
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:12,712
On the other hand, Dan Buettner found another such place.

172
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:15,036
The Japanese Okinawa Island.

173
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:19,732
With the longest disability-free life 
expectancy in the world found there.

174
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:22,489
They set out on an expedition to these places

175
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:27,166
to find out why people lived for so long here.

176
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:31,243
The team of scientists and demographers explores the world

177
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,867
and finds five such Blue Zones.

178
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:35,670
The first was Sardinia in Italy.

179
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,343
Second, Okinawa in Japan.

180
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:39,483
Third, in the American state of California

181
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:43,112
Loma Linda's Seventh-day Adventist community.

182
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:45,682
It is a religious sect within Christianity.

183
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:48,586
Fourth, the island of Icaria in Greece.

184
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:53,024
And fifth, the region of the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica.

185
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:55,212
People living in these five blue zones

186
00:07:55,212 --> 00:07:59,119
live a longer life than the rest of the world.

187
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,828
Is there anything special about these places?

188
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,927
Maybe the clean water and clean air here

189
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:05,712
or is it the lifestyle choices of these people

190
00:08:05,712 --> 00:08:07,189
that facilitates this.

191
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:10,847
Dan and his team worked for years to find out the real reason.

192
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:12,874
And finally, when they publish their report,

193
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:15,236
they say that the real reason was

194
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:17,366
the lifestyle habits of the residents.

195
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:20,222
Specifically, 9 lifestyle habits

196
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:22,166
were common across these regions.

197
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,427
They refer to these 9 habits as Power 9.

198
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:26,572
What are these habits?

199
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,161
Let's find out one by one

200
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:29,693
so that you can learn from them,

201
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:31,496
implement them in your life

202
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:33,668
and live a long life.

203
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:35,433
The first lifestyle habit is

204
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:36,969
to 'Move Naturally.'

205
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:39,400
It's not that the elderly people living in blue zones

206
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,784
go to the gym and lift heavy weights regularly

207
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:43,830
or run a marathon.

208
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,758
In fact, their environment encourages

209
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:51,255
small natural movements throughout the day.

210
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,597
For example, most of these people live in villages

211
00:08:53,597 --> 00:08:55,481
where cars are not used much.

212
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:57,833
In fact, if they want to go to meet their friends

213
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,302
or go to work,

214
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:00,696
they have to walk.

215
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:04,068
Along with that, these people grow their gardens near their homes,

216
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:06,035
where they go and work by themselves.

217
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:07,966
Contrast this with the modern world,

218
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:10,694
where nowadays, most people sit at home,

219
00:09:10,694 --> 00:09:13,544
get in the car and go to the office

220
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:15,212
where they sit and work.

221
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:17,196
And if they want to go somewhere for entertainment,

222
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:18,667
they get in the car

223
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:21,899
and go to the cinema hall to watch a movie while they sit and relax.

224
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,688
Natural walking is so rare in our modern lifestyle.

225
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:30,301
The American Cancer Society surveyed more than 125,000 adults

226
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:34,200
and found that people who sit for more than 6 hours a day

227
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,222
have a 19% higher chance of dy!ng in the next 21 years.

228
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:39,854
Cancer, coronary heart disease,

229
00:09:39,854 --> 00:09:41,739
stroke, diabetes, kidney disease,

230
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,766
liver disease, Parkinson's disease,

231
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:45,854
Alzheimer's, nervous disorders,

232
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:47,658
a total of 14 causes of de@th

233
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:51,358
become more likely to occur the more you remain seated.

234
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,951
Many studies have shown a major correlation here.

235
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:55,724
Look at the latest study which states that

236
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:58,865
by walking at least 11 minutes every day,

237
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,368
the risk of premature de@th

238
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,005
is reduced by 25%.

239
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:04,424
Just by walking for 11 minutes.

240
00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:06,553
But obviously, in the case of blue zones,

241
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:08,580
natural walking is much more common.

242
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,119
The more you include natural walking in your daily life,

243
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,595
the better it is.

244
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:16,318
Now, walking uses specific muscles of the legs,

245
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:20,945
but it is very important to naturally move every muscle in the body.

246
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:22,950
What we see in Okinawa is that

247
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,812
people don't have a lot of furniture in their homes.

248
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:28,140
Instead of using dining tables

249
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,355
people sit on the floor to eat.

250
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:31,421
What is the benefit of this?

251
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:33,877
They have to sit down and get up at least 3-4 times a day.

252
00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:35,021
More natural movement.

253
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:36,305
The simple logic is to

254
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:41,253
try to incorporate natural movements in daily life as much as possible.

255
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:43,711
You can buy a standing desk instead of a normal desk.

256
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:47,367
You can sit on the floor and eat instead of at the dining table.

257
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:50,466
In many places in India, this has been the traditional way.

258
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,095
And instead of using a car,

259
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:55,045
use a cycle or walk as much as possible.

260
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:56,728
The second point is purpose.

261
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:59,229
Dan's researchers found that in Okinawa,

262
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:01,657
there is no concept like retirement.

263
00:11:01,657 --> 00:11:04,945
In fact, there is a Japanese concept called Ikigai.

264
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:07,019
It means 'a reason for being.'

265
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,958
What is the purpose of my life?

266
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,354
To have a sense of purpose.

267
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:12,955
When people in Japan turn 90-100 years old,

268
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:15,151
they don't retire and give up on life.

269
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:18,273
Instead, they find the Ikigai of their life.

270
00:11:18,273 --> 00:11:21,424
A similar concept has been seen in Costa Rica's Blue Zone

271
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:22,779
called Plan de Vida,

272
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:25,665
which translates to a Life Plan.

273
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:28,837
Dan's research found that having a sense of purpose in life

274
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:32,887
can increase life expectancy by up to 7 years.

275
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:34,358
Now, the interesting thing is that

276
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:36,461
to have a life purpose doesn't necessarily mean

277
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:40,190
a purpose that will transform the world.

278
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,568
The things that give you long-term satisfaction in daily life,

279
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:45,156
that gives you internal happiness,

280
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:47,386
those things can also be your purpose.

281
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:49,865
For example, volunteering for an NGO,

282
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:52,505
becoming skilled in an art or craft,

283
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:55,941
or picking up any hobby that you enjoy doing.

284
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:58,264
Point number 3, Downshift.

285
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:01,089
We all know that stress is not good for us.

286
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:03,517
But do you know that chronic stress

287
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:06,734
a stress that you have to endure for a long period

288
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:09,629
can be very harmful to your health?

289
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,311
According to a study by Yale,

290
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:13,477
if you are under a lot of chronic stress,

291
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:15,224
your age faster.

292
00:12:15,224 --> 00:12:17,296
Many studies have repeatedly shown that

293
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:18,605
due to chronic stress,

294
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,643
the risk of heart attack increases,

295
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:22,284
the risk of diabetes increases,

296
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,064
and the risk of cancer increases.

297
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:28,055
Almost every age-related disease is associated with stress.

298
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:29,132
Look at this article.

299
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:32,470
According to one study, if you are stressed at work,

300
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,905
your life can be shorter by 33 years.

301
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:38,102
What is special about people living in blue zones?

302
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:40,419
It's not that they don't get stressed.

303
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:44,382
The thing is that they have made such habits in their daily routines

304
00:12:44,382 --> 00:12:46,755
that allows them to remain stress-free.

305
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:50,652
Okinawans take some time every day to remember their ancestors.

306
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:53,786
Adventists of California pray.

307
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:56,529
Icarians of Greece take a nap in the afternoon

308
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:59,676
and Sardinians of Italy practice the happy hour.

309
00:12:59,676 --> 00:13:02,920
These are the things that help them reduce their stress levels.

310
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,020
Okinawans have a special place in their home

311
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,011
which is called Butsudan

312
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:10,356
where they can honour their ancestors.

313
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:14,227
And Adventists of California practice spiritual prayer.

314
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,056
So, one interesting thing to note here is that

315
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,244
praying to God is also

316
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:20,853
an effective way to reduce your stress.

317
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:22,870
And taking naps in the afternoon,

318
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,939
sleeping for 1-2 hours,

319
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:29,103
research has proved that it improves your cardiovascular health

320
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:31,325
and helps you lower the levels of stress.

321
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:34,501
On the other hand, the way to reduce stress for Sardinians is

322
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:36,328
through social interaction.

323
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:39,009
They have a happy hour from 5 PM to 7 PM

324
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,852
when they meet their friends and family.

325
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:42,341
So the lesson here is that

326
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:44,992
you should also have a daily ritual in your life

327
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:46,840
to reduce your stress.

328
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,202
Whether you do yoga, meditation, pray to God,

329
00:13:50,202 --> 00:13:52,727
go to church and pray, offer Namaz,

330
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:54,427
spend time with your family,

331
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:55,471
nap in the afternoon or

332
00:13:55,471 --> 00:13:57,631
participate in some sports or exercise.

333
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,555
It is important not to get stressed.

334
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:02,086
Fourth point, 80% rule.

335
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:04,877
In Japan, there is a phrase called Harahachibu.

336
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:08,852
Which means to eat until you are 8 parts full.

337
00:14:08,852 --> 00:14:11,122
While eating eat only so much

338
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:13,455
that your stomach is only 80% full.

339
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:16,852
Don't eat so much that you are 100% full.

340
00:14:16,852 --> 00:14:19,255
In Okinawa, this practice is followed

341
00:14:19,255 --> 00:14:23,954
which reminds people to stop eating after they are 80% full.

342
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:28,499
In the 4th century BC, Ayurvedic medicine also described this principle.

343
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:32,461
It says to fill up 1/3rd your stomach with the liquid,

344
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:33,952
1/3rd with the food,

345
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:35,682
and leave the remaining 1/3rd empty.

346
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:39,684
Generally, there are proven scientific benefits of eating less food.

347
00:14:39,684 --> 00:14:41,189
And the interesting thing is that

348
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:45,342
fasting has been a part of almost every religion or culture for centuries.

349
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,510
Hindus fast during Navratri,

350
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,432
Muslims fast during Ramadan

351
00:14:49,432 --> 00:14:52,011
and some Christians fast before Easter.

352
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:56,394
Scientists have found that fasting has many scientific benefits.

353
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:59,656
Last year, Yale School published a clinical trial.

354
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:04,044
It found that those who cut their calorie intake by 14%

355
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:06,660
saw many health improvements in their life.

356
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,685
Their ageing pace slowed down.

357
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:12,673
In 1935, a scientist, Clive McCay,

358
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:14,802
made a shocking discovery on rats.

359
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:16,876
He gave rats little food

360
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:19,564
and found that the lifespan of rats

361
00:15:19,564 --> 00:15:22,262
increased by 33% by doing this.

362
00:15:22,262 --> 00:15:26,957
Similar experiments have been done on many 
different animals in the last few decades.

363
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:29,213
Be it worms, rats or monkeys.

364
00:15:29,213 --> 00:15:31,848
Specific details vary from study to study

365
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,860
but every study came to the same conclusion.

366
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,000
By eating less food regularly

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,729
lifespan extends from 50% to 300%.

368
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:42,416
Point number 5, Plant Slant.

369
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,926
The diet of most of the people in the blue zone

370
00:15:44,926 --> 00:15:46,310
is a plant-slant diet.

371
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,685
This diet is mostly a plant-based vegetarian diet.

372
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:53,018
In the blue zones, either people don't eat meat at all

373
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,390
or if they do, it is a small part of their meal.

374
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,534
In the diets of all these centenarians,

375
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:00,871
a large amount of beans is seen.

376
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:02,947
Whether it is fava beans, black beans,

377
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:05,640
soybeans or literally lentils.

378
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,632
In places like Okinawa, people do eat pork

379
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:11,922
but on average, they eat it only 5 times a month.

380
00:16:11,922 --> 00:16:14,054
But apart from this, in all blue zones,

381
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,609
whole grains are eaten a lot.

382
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:17,847
Various types of vegetables are eaten a lot.

383
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:19,890
And tubers are eaten a lot.

384
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,787
Tubers are anything that grows under the ground.

385
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:26,979
Like sweet potatoes or potatoes or nuts or beans.

386
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:30,311
In California, the blue zone community, called Loma Linda,

387
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:31,932
there people are fully vegetarian

388
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:33,604
and some of them are vegan.

389
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:38,014
In 2023, an analysis was done analyzing multiple research studies

390
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:40,586
between 1980 and 2022,

391
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:43,619
where vegetarian and vegan diets were observed.

392
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,281
And the conclusion was that

393
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:49,778
eating a plant-based diet reduces the risk of several diseases.

394
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:52,964
Diabetes, Dementia, High Blood Pressure, Obesity,

395
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:55,449
Colon Cancer, Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer,

396
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:56,549
Depression.

397
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,911
And the meta-analysis by Dan on the Plant-Slant Diet,

398
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:02,481
found that in these 5 blue zones,

399
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,442
the centenarians that were surveyed,

400
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:09,323
95% of them ate plant-based diets.

401
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:10,516
Point number 6,

402
00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:11,630
Wine@5.

403
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,200
This is a largely controversial point.

404
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,073
Dan's research found that in most blue zones,

405
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:18,211
except for the California blue zone,

406
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:21,589
people consumed alcohol in moderate amounts.

407
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,616
For example, in Sardinia,

408
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:26,999
people drink 1-2 glasses of red wine every day.

409
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:28,828
If you look at old research papers,

410
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:30,510
many such researches show that

411
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,400
drinking red wine in moderation can be good for health.

412
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,989
The reason behind this is

413
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:38,672
the antioxidants present in red wine, like Resveratrol.

414
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:41,652
It increases the amount of good cholesterol in the body.

415
00:17:41,652 --> 00:17:43,587
But this is the only point

416
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:45,304
that has perhaps become outdated.

417
00:17:45,304 --> 00:17:48,538
Because the latest research and studies tell us that

418
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:52,657
even a small amount of alcohol can be harmful to you.

419
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:55,675
That is, drinking zero alcohol is the healthiest.

420
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:59,599
This shows that the centenarians living in the blue zones

421
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,056
are living a long life,

422
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:02,718
not because of drinking wine,

423
00:18:02,718 --> 00:18:04,441
but despite drinking wine.

424
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:07,896
The beneficial antioxidant in red wine, resveratrol,

425
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:10,674
is also found in grape juice actually.

426
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,248
And even better than grape juice,

427
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:13,496
it is found in grapes.

428
00:18:13,496 --> 00:18:15,270
So if you want to benefit from this,

429
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,853
simply eat grapes.

430
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:18,702
Point number 7, is Belong,

431
00:18:18,702 --> 00:18:21,397
which can be called the sense of belonging.

432
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:24,650
263 centenarians were interviewed

433
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,900
and every one of them except 5

434
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,224
was part of some faith-based community.

435
00:18:30,224 --> 00:18:32,959
It doesn't matter which religion you believe in,

436
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,836
or whether you believe in religion or not.

437
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:40,065
You must become a part of a social or spiritual community.

438
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:42,702
This community can be your religious community as well.

439
00:18:42,702 --> 00:18:45,399
Any community that gives you a purpose,

440
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:48,843
peace, and a positive outlook in life.

441
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:51,079
Another way to get this is

442
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,924
to do community service,

443
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:56,273
volunteer, help people, or do charity.

444
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:58,919
You can get this sense of belonging even then.

445
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,453
Dan's research found that this is so important that

446
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:06,905
for people who attend faith-based services 4 times a month,

447
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:11,049
their life expectancy increases from 4-14 years.

448
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:15,279
Imagine, you will live for 14 more years by doing this.

449
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,841
Point number 8, Loved Ones First.

450
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:22,053
Centenarians from the blue zone prioritize their family.

451
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:26,508
Either they live in the area around their ageing parents and grandparents

452
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:28,428
or they live with them in the same home.

453
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:31,823
Apart from this, they remain committed to their one life partner

454
00:19:31,823 --> 00:19:33,519
with whose help, according to Dan's research,

455
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,832
life expectancy can increase by 3 years.

456
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:38,693
And then they invest their time and affection in their children.

457
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:41,851
Finally, we come to the last 9th point,

458
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:44,023
which is Right Tribe.

459
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:47,475
Okinawans have a friend circle of about 5 friends,

460
00:19:47,475 --> 00:19:51,110
and they are committed to their 5 friends for the rest of their lives.

461
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,846
People living in blue zones are part of such social circles

462
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:57,223
that support these healthy behaviours.

463
00:19:57,223 --> 00:19:58,849
Many research papers show that

464
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:00,837
things like smoking, obesity,

465
00:20:00,837 --> 00:20:04,380
happiness, and loneliness are contagious.

466
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,275
If your friend circle is made up of such people

467
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:09,598
who promote good habits

468
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:11,166
and not bad habits

469
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,241
then it can be very beneficial for you.

470
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:15,861
The reason behind this is very simple.

471
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:18,944
Following healthy behaviours becomes very easy

472
00:20:18,944 --> 00:20:22,417
when people around you are following the same healthy behaviours.

473
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:25,749
After listening to all this, you must be thinking.

474
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:29,468
Is it possible to live a long life outside these 5 blue zones?

475
00:20:29,468 --> 00:20:31,820
Dan wondered the same thing as well.

476
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,744
In his opinion,

477
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:37,405
a 6th blue zone can be added to this group soon.

478
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:42,354
A blue zone where traditionally people didn't have a healthy lifestyle,

479
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:46,684
but in the future, due to their changing behaviour,

480
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:49,283
they can definitely become a new blue zone.

481
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:51,767
Singapore.

482
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:54,059
Dan says that he has witnessed

483
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:57,953
life expectancy in Singapore increasing by almost 25 years.

484
00:20:57,953 --> 00:21:00,216
Today, people living in Singapore

485
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:03,344
have one of the longest and healthiest life expectancies.

486
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:06,439
The reason behind this is the policies made by the government,

487
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,831
which subsidize healthy food

488
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:11,549
and impose heavy taxes on junk food.

489
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:14,541
Government policies promote walking.

490
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:19,135
The infrastructure is designed to make 
people walk more in their daily lives.

491
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:24,212
And there is a heavy tax on driving to discourage it.

492
00:21:24,212 --> 00:21:26,765
Another interesting thing in Singapore is that 

493
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:32,194
if your elderly parents live within a radius of 500 yards of your house,

494
00:21:32,194 --> 00:21:34,066
you get a tax break.

495
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,886
So the result is in front of you, friends.

496
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:40,069
Now you know exactly what you have to do to live a long life.

497
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:43,338
You may not be able to break the record of being the world's oldest human.

498
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:47,382
You may need a lot of luck to live for 120 years.

499
00:21:47,382 --> 00:21:50,878
But if you follow the things I have told you in this video,

500
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:52,727
you will easily live for a century.

501
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:55,035
If you liked the video, you can watch this video

502
00:21:55,035 --> 00:21:56,714
on the world's fattest country.

503
00:21:56,714 --> 00:22:00,221
In this video, I told you about extremely positive examples.

504
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:02,814
In that video, I will tell you about an extremely negative example

505
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:04,439
of what you should not do.

506
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,972
You can click here to watch it.

507
00:22:05,972 --> 00:22:07,573
Thank you very much!
