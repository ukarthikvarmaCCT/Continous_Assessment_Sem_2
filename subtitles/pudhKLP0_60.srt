1
00:00:00,707 --> 00:00:03,253
How is it going Prerna, Harsh, and Asher?

2
00:00:03,413 --> 00:00:05,270
I have a challenge for all 3 of you, okay?

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,543
I want you to pick any fast food location of your choice

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,503
and spent 24 hours in it without being kicked out.

5
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:12,625
Good luck!

6
00:00:17,032 --> 00:00:18,565
What to do?

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,950
It's from Mr. Beast and not
an ordinary challenge.

8
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:29,627
We are in the McDonald's and I
am going to be here for 24 hours.

9
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:33,453
We searched for the biggest and most empty McDonald's.

10
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:34,732
It's highly rated.

11
00:00:34,757 --> 00:00:35,745
It has two floors.

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:43,488
It was very crowded so we
sneaked to the first floor.

13
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:45,676
We are now sitting in the corner.

14
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:47,661
So Harsh, we now have to order

15
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:49,969
And how will we pass the time?

16
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:53,456
I have thought of ordering the full menu.

17
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:58,729
It will take time for us to eat and
they won't rush us out.

18
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:01,678
You have become as cunning as me in my company.

19
00:01:01,703 --> 00:01:04,758
And your son will be the most cunning.

20
00:01:04,783 --> 00:01:06,810
He is saying that he will eat fries.

21
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:10,177
Go to the floor below and order the full menu.

22
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:11,610
It's 10:00 am.

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,114
Go order fast.
Hand me your parcel.

24
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:15,402
Don't take him with you.

25
00:01:15,427 --> 00:01:17,050
yes. Keep it with you.

26
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:24,150
Mr. Beast's channel is in Hindi so let's see some videos.

27
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:25,959
I opened his channel.

28
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:30,338
First, go to Settings, then Audio, and select Hindi.

29
00:01:30,464 --> 00:01:34,037
In this video, we are going to rescue 100 street dogs.

30
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,990
Isn't it awesome?

31
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:38,951
Since we have to pass the time, let's change seats.

32
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:42,502
- Prerna, Asher wants to sit in this one.
- Jumping from here to there.

33
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:44,775
The way he is

34
00:01:44,902 --> 00:01:47,434
I wanna do a trampoline and drive the jeep.

35
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:50,258
Asher, let's do this after we are
done with the challenge.

36
00:01:50,283 --> 00:01:52,248
Please, mom!

37
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:56,840
It's been 15 minutes and it was the best decision.
I mean what would happen in 15 minutes?

38
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:58,440
We have to spend so much time here.

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,027
Our order is here and I was hungry also.

40
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:03,782
So I am gonna eat so much.

41
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:06,803
The full McDonald's menu is here.

42
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,490
Kartik Aaryan meal!
When did this start coming?

43
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:09,998
Asher, do you wanna have the Kartik Aryan meal?

44
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,396
He wants to eat Asher's meal.

45
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:15,068
He wants to be popular so
that his photo is on it.

46
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:19,255
So I am gonna take an
hour to eat all this.

47
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:21,372
It's a big day and we have a lot of time.

48
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,805
But I don't know how will I settle Asher.

49
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,458
Because he has to play around.

50
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:27,393
Should I let him down?

51
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:30,186
The first item is the Butter Paneer Grilled Burger.

52
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:31,563
Then we have McVeggie.

53
00:02:31,614 --> 00:02:33,322
Then we have Maharaja McVeg.

54
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,675
- Give me this one.
- Eat all of them.

55
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,086
Kartik Aryan Meal Burger.

56
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:38,412
Spicy Wrap Paneer.

57
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:39,065
McPuff.

58
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:41,459
I have all types of fries - small, medium, and large.

59
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:44,145
And there are more burgers.

60
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:44,780
Excuse me Harsh.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,151
There also is McSpicy Paneer Burger.

62
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:47,732
Okay!

63
00:02:47,763 --> 00:02:49,882
McSurprise Whole Wheat Burger.

64
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:51,849
Ice Teas, Large Coke!

65
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:54,189
And that's coffee for me! Cold Coffee.

66
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,942
Coffee.
That's total Rs. 1500.

67
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,524
That's a very affordable price for Mc Meal.

68
00:02:57,649 --> 00:03:00,356
We have to pass the time and not rush it.

69
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,030
They must have it limited.

70
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:04,696
Let's start with iced tea.

71
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:05,640
I'll eat fries then.

72
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,699
What's special in the Kartik Aryan Burger?

73
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:09,047
It's McAloo Tikki Burger.

74
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:11,074
It is the same.

75
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:13,371
They keep checking on us.

76
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:15,268
It's the start, no one will object to anything.

77
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:17,483
2-3 hours are pretty easy to spend here.

78
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:20,542
Let's start with the big burgers, McMaharja.

79
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,110
It's very tasty.

80
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:25,676
What have you done to McMaharaja?

81
00:03:25,803 --> 00:03:27,256
It's a Zoom burger.

82
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:28,509
One bite challenge.

83
00:03:30,522 --> 00:03:33,635
He is snatching the burgers from me.

84
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,716
You are not of age. Well, here eat some.

85
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:42,860
Don't eat.

86
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:45,386
Feeding a baby is so tough.

87
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:47,667
They won't eat what they are
supposed to but paper only.

88
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:48,634
Have you ever tried

89
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:50,835
fries dipped in Ice Tea?

90
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:53,520
That's a weird combination.
You just ruined them.

91
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:55,942
Who does eat like this?

92
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:57,383
I eat without tomatoes.

93
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:59,716
Do tell me in the comments how
do you eat your burger?

94
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:03,199
Also, tell me what's your
favourite burger from these?

95
00:04:03,224 --> 00:04:05,281
If you want to be in top subscribers

and Hina!

101
00:04:09,253 --> 00:04:10,730
The moment you take your eyes off,
you meet with a situation.

102
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:13,190
He has eaten a full tissue.

103
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:15,531
Handle him. Look at
what he is doing!

104
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:17,297
He can do anything.

105
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:20,532
He is eating Ketch Up!
Oh, it's not opened yet.

106
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,250
Asher, you didn't like the fries?

107
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:27,843
Now you would have to mop.

108
00:04:30,982 --> 00:04:32,835
- Hello!
- Hello!

109
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:33,661
Do you watch our videos?

110
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:36,845
Thank You!

111
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:41,328
We met with a subscriber
while doing this video.

112
00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:42,994
You know we are doing a challenge?

113
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:45,953
That you will get to know
after watching this video.

114
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:49,566
It will be out the next week.

115
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:50,881
Tell us your name.

116
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:52,934
- My name is Sanket.
- Mine is Vansh.

117
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:54,715
Vansh, Sanket, Kunj!

118
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:56,135
Such good names!

119
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,667
If you watch our videos, tell us
which is your favourite?

120
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,127
The 'Our Home is Haunted' one.

121
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:06,489
This is cheating!

122
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,997
- It was so nice to meet you all.
- Thank You.

123
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:17,036
- You didn't eat the fries?
- You ruined my challenge.

124
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:21,021
I wanted to count how many fries are
there in small, medium and large.

125
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:24,218
There are 150, 200, and 250 fries in those.

126
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,724
Don't tell me rubbish.
I wanted to calculate.

127
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:27,945
Go, get them for me again.

128
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,529
Now she will count the fries.

129
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,188
I will get to know how many fries
are there in small, medium and large.

130
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:35,672
We have so much time.

131
00:05:35,697 --> 00:05:36,963
I will get them. Don't worry.

132
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:41,935
Harsh is going to get us fries meanwhile
I will change Asher's diaper.

133
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,742
It's been so much time.

134
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:45,190
let's clean him and I will touch up my face.

135
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:47,156
let's go to the washroom, Asher.

136
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:53,689
We are in the washroom but
there is no changing station.

137
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:57,179
There should be one
diaper changing station.

138
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,905
Where should I change it now?

139
00:05:58,955 --> 00:06:00,511
Look at how he is looking at it.
So focused.

140
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:03,738
So we will do the changing here.

141
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:07,417
I waiting for Harsh to come here.
Here he is!

142
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:08,730
He is here with all preparation.

143
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:09,858
Asher, this is your bed.

144
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:15,464
The diaper has been changed now.

145
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:16,593
But he isn't lying on his back.

146
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:19,450
He created a ruckus.

147
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:21,244
Sometimes he feels hot and cold.

148
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:24,676
It was so easy on the bed.

149
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:25,399
Should we go home?

150
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:27,833
You ate the meal it was the challenge.

151
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:32,282
- Give him the lipstick.
- No. He has already broken one.

152
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,298
- Is that so?
- Yes

153
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:37,806
- Harsh!
- Yes

154
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:39,605
- What happened?
- You said you got a full meal?

155
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,409
- Yes obviously
- There were hot beverages. You didn't get them.

156
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:43,776
I want free coffee with them.

157
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:46,224
- You want coffee?
- Yes.

158
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:52,212
Harsh is going to get me the coffee and
I am gonna decide in which corner I can hide.

159
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:53,327
I have to spend the night here.

160
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:55,295
This table? I will get caught.

161
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,294
- Under this table?
- yes.

162
00:06:57,378 --> 00:06:59,062
Yeah, I can hide here.

163
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:02,008
Asher is looking at the rides outside.

164
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:03,635
Can I take him outside for the rides?

165
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,345
No.

166
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:07,973
It's Asher's first challenge that too by Mr. Beast.

167
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:10,027
He called out his name.

168
00:07:10,052 --> 00:07:10,499
Harshi!

169
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:11,987
Harshi and Asher.

170
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,370
It's Mr. Beast's challenge and
we have to complete it.

171
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:18,110
Guys I am jumping from one seat to another.

172
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:21,180
We have changed so many seats
and spent so much time here.

173
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:24,080
it seems like it's my second home.

174
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:26,783
But I am very tired and I
don't know what to do.

175
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:29,526
I am thinking of getting a nap right here.

176
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:30,600
There is no other option.

177
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,111
You can handle Asher?

178
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:33,544
Definitely. You go to sleep.

179
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:36,195
It's been evening from the morning.

180
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,557
We are tired of watching this view.

181
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:41,006
The staff is also bored of seeing us here.

182
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:45,070
Asher is feeling sleepy and hungry.

183
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,397
It's milk time for Asher.

184
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:50,801
I found a baby chair.

185
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,056
Let's give Asher milk in this chair.

186
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:55,004
And here is my coffee.

187
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:56,396
Where is the coffee?

188
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,140
- See what I got?
- I already saw it and thought of making him sit in that.

189
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:03,933
- Where?
- Anywhere!

190
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:05,410
it's our home now. Anywhere!

191
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:07,907
Your coffee. Where is his milk?

192
00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:10,232
- That's what I am making!
- Wow Prerna

193
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,030
It's almost evening.

194
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:15,130
Eat play and be happy.

195
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:17,458
It's the best spot.

196
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:19,155
It's all empty.

197
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,953
This is your milk.

198
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:23,683
Make it in a good quantity.

199
00:08:24,118 --> 00:08:25,138
I will make it so much.

200
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,537
Here have the milk.

201
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:40,641
As you can see Mr. Beast. how good Asher is doing the challenge.

202
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:42,668
He is the best challenger in the world.

203
00:08:42,693 --> 00:08:46,177
Guys spam 'Asher OG challenger' in the comments.

204
00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:48,297
Now Prerna has started dancing with Asher.

205
00:08:48,322 --> 00:08:49,313
To make him asleep.

206
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:52,152
First Asher will sleep then I will.

207
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,420
We will sleep and then it will soon be dark.

208
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:57,611
And we will hide and that's how we will complete our challenge.

209
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,572
They will kick us out.

210
00:08:59,597 --> 00:09:01,834
Let's keep ordering.

211
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:02,595
get me an ice cream.

212
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:04,919
McFloaty.

213
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:09,070
It feels like heaven in the lap of Dad.

214
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,237
I have to sleep sleep sleep.

215
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:17,112
Harsh how to pass the time?

216
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:27,382
it's been evening from day and I thought to touch up a little.

217
00:09:27,415 --> 00:09:28,421
It's more red.

218
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:32,358
Harsh is still walking with Asher.

219
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,844
- Aren't you tired?
- Very

220
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:36,612
- Thank You!
- Thank You.

221
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:38,625
He didn't seem happy to me.

222
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,685
We are bothering him with orders.

223
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,744
This is my fourth coffee.

224
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:44,603
To accompany me Harsh has ordered hot chocolate.

225
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:46,483
This is already my fourth coffee.

226
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,382
I ordered only because of the cookie.

227
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:50,904
It's the best chocolate.

228
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:53,743
And it was a good cookie so I ordered coffee 4times.

229
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:55,062
I have had four cookies.

230
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:57,255
They have been pissed off a little by us.

231
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:59,773
They weren't coming for the coffee I ordered 30 minutes ago.

232
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:03,225
They said we should take out the order by ourselves.

233
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:07,415
I was eavesdropping.

234
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,311
The kid behind us is also named Asher.

235
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,506
You only do this, don't you?

236
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:13,495
I have to pass the time.
 What else to do?

237
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,682
She gets super attentive while she is sitting somewhere.

238
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:19,122
The lights are turned on outside.

239
00:10:19,147 --> 00:10:20,149
It's evening now.

240
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:21,555
I feel sleepy.

241
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,570
I am trying again and finally, he is drinking the milk.

242
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:26,737
Let's order him a hot chocolate.

243
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:28,124
He is not of age.

244
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:29,417
It's like a house now.

245
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:31,904
He is again taking him to walk around.

246
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:34,019
While exploring the M McDonald's menu.

247
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,700
We found a goggle for Asher.

248
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:38,788
It's a little big for his face.

249
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:40,636
These were the only ones in the kid's section.

250
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:42,860
- I am not interested.
- Try it on once.

251
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:45,581
You will see double momies and daddies.

252
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,240
He wants to eat that too.

253
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:50,185
no, I  am not giving it to you.

254
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,144
Play with this.

255
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:56,511
He likes McD.

256
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:57,993
Just we couldn't.

257
00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:21,788
What happened?

258
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,148
He is slapping me.

259
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:25,848
He wants to ride in the car.

260
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:28,124
- It's a challenge.
- He wants to go to trampoline.

261
00:11:28,657 --> 00:11:31,384
He wants to go with them.

262
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:32,825
He got bored here.

263
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,660
Your fries are here.

264
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:35,337
Count them.

265
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:36,791
It's a happy meal.

266
00:11:37,428 --> 00:11:39,601
He cried seeing the happy meal.

267
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,440
Thank You!

268
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:48,360
Now I am going to tell you 
what's in a happy meal.

269
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:56,767
We have a Kartik Aryan burger, fries, coke and
it's a book inside the Pokemon Pikachu's box.

270
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:57,875
And pineapple juice.

271
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,452
What happened? Your neck got stuck?

272
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,392
Let's go home.

273
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:03,559
He got me upset.
He is slapping me.

274
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:07,102
Now I am going to count how many fries 
are there in small, medium, and large.

275
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:08,855
First, let's start with small.

276
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:16,620
19...20...I won't be able to fill them back in...
21...22

277
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,205
- 41
- Small has 41 fries.

278
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,480
Now medium.

279
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:24,603
Guess how many would be in this?

280
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:28,989
- I guess 70
- Don't confuse me.

281
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:36,317
67 fries.

282
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:38,044
I guessed 70.

283
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:39,147
I was close.

284
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,694
- NOw large.
- First guess.

285
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:44,292
Around 60. Medium is similar to large.

286
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:45,505
It would be a fraud then.

287
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:48,319
- We will get to know soon.
- I am guessing 85.

288
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:55,180
I feel it has the least fries.

289
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:09,033
large fries are a myth.

290
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:11,119
Never order large fries from now on.

291
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:12,821
Medium is good enough.

292
00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:15,102
I will say order small.

293
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:19,264
They robbed us. I used to think how 
many would be there in large.

294
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:21,403
He comes for cleaning again and again.

295
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:22,182
Thank You!

296
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:23,897
He is very helpful.

297
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:25,224
Let's give him a meal.

298
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,499
Call him over.

299
00:13:26,524 --> 00:13:28,802
It was good until we hadn't calculated.

300
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:32,820
It's a shock. 
Medium and large are the same.

301
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:37,674
I was getting bored so we will now do a Happy Meal challenge.

302
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,857
We will do an epic Happy Meal challenge.

303
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:42,900
This is the fastest eating challenge.

304
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:46,140
Let's see who finishes the happy meal between me and Dhruv.

305
00:13:46,165 --> 00:13:47,699
1...2...3...start.

306
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:49,617
Jump right in.

307
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:51,738
Don't eat in such a bad way.

308
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:54,553
- Dhruv you couldn't even eat it.

309
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,780
Come on do it one bite.

310
00:13:57,894 --> 00:13:59,714
Go for a single bite.

311
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:01,754
I would eat fires.

312
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:05,048
Look at how badly they are eating.

313
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:06,442
I think he will win.

314
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:08,720
- My fries are finished.
- Finished?

315
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,030
So fast!

316
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:12,636
There are no tomatoes.

317
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:13,836
You are behind.

318
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:15,084
Come on.

319
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:16,302
Don't you want to win?

320
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:18,624
Dhruv has lost

321
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:19,907
In how many bites are you gonna finish it?

322
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:21,107
3 bites.

323
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:21,849
Let's ee.

324
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:22,549
1

325
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:23,483
2

326
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:26,608
 The end.

327
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:29,835
He hasn't even finished the fries. 
he is way behind.

328
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:31,597
No, the Pepsi.

329
00:14:31,711 --> 00:14:34,624
Dhruv lost and harshly ate the meal in 20 seconds

330
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:38,403
The world is moving but she isn't.

331
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:41,697
Because Asher is asleep and now 
I have to keep sitting like this.

332
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:44,421
Asher liked McD.

333
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:45,261
Sorry!

334
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:51,655
They have got very comfortable here.

335
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,869
We have to be here so we had to make it comfortable.

336
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:01,781
They have been standing right 
here for the last 15 minutes.

337
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:02,987
What are you looking at?

338
00:15:03,011 --> 00:15:06,328
Asher is looking at the car and trampoline.

339
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:10,176
He wants to go there. He is stuck here.

340
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:12,475
He is saying he can do it tomorrow.

341
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,183
Today he feels good here.

342
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:17,716
We want to go there. he is getting sad.

343
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:19,464
We will go after the challenge.

344
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,044
- We will circle back here 
- No the challenge will end.

345
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:23,476
- It won't.
- It will.

346
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,400
- It won't.
- It will.

347
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:28,891
So Harsh and Asher left.

348
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:32,644
I thought of taking him on this car ride.

349
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:34,936
He is enjoying it so much.
Should I leave Asher?

350
00:15:35,288 --> 00:15:37,811
He isn't seeing me.
Look up your mother is doing the challenge.

351
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:46,529
He isn't sitting but standing.

352
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:53,033
After spending the day, the evening,
the night in the McDonald's

353
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:57,665
Harsh and Asher got soft over a car.
A battery car.

354
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,199
We got Asher to the trampoline.

355
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,215
Asher go fetch the ball once.

356
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:02,361
Come back after getting the ball.

357
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:04,204
We are waiting for Prerna.

358
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,938
When she will be content?

359
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,765
Otherwise, we will wait
here but not go up.

360
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:12,383
It's the McDonald's where we are doing our challenge.

361
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:14,069
Prerna is sitting up there somewhere.

362
00:16:14,094 --> 00:16:15,704
- Do you wanna order anything last?
- Last, means?

363
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:18,340
- It's gonna close at 11 PM.
- Isn't this 24/7?

364
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:20,586
- No. It's not 24/7
- Can't I stay here?

365
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:22,359
You can stay here but you
would have to do the dishes.

366
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:26,915
Just give me 5 minutes to think.

367
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:28,214
Is this gonna close?

368
00:16:33,645 --> 00:16:34,400
Do you want to eat anything?

369
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:37,938
Okay.

370
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:42,472
What? I mean I thought it was 24/7.

371
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:44,122
It closes at 11 PM.

372
00:16:44,226 --> 00:16:46,276
What to do now?
Should I try to hide?

373
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:50,327
Will I fit here?

374
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:52,407
Won't someone catch me here?

375
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:54,064
What are you doing mam?

376
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:56,170
I was trying to hide in here.

377
00:16:58,332 --> 00:17:00,188
Okay. I am going.

378
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:03,979
Sorry Mr Beast! I have to leave now.

379
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:06,504
I have to leave.

380
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:07,260
Bye!
