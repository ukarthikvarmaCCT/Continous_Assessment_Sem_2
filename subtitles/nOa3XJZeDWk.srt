00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,916
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,916 --> 00:00:02,732
On 1st January 2024,

3
00:00:02,732 --> 00:00:06,021
when the world was celebrating 
the beginning of a new year,

4
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:11,023
Japan was hit by a terrible 7.6-magnitude earthquake.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,530
"In Western Japan, scenes of devastation

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,418
are emerging after a 7.6-magnitude earthquake

7
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:18,504
shook the country

8
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:19,924
k!lling dozens of people."

9
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:22,433
This earthquake was not alone.

10
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:26,146
Numerous earthquakes, small and big, followed this.

11
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:29,142
In total, more than 155 earthquakes

12
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:31,220
occurred in just one day.

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,883
Because of this, sea waves about 1 meter high

14
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:42,162
hit the west coast of Japan.

15
00:00:42,162 --> 00:00:44,198
Japan's meteorological agency

16
00:00:44,198 --> 00:00:47,207
had also issued a major tsunami alert.

17
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,716
Although this warning was downgraded later,

18
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:53,016
but the earthquake itself 
caused substantial damage.

19
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:55,376
Dozens of buildings were completely destroyed.

20
00:00:55,376 --> 00:00:57,413
Electricity was cut off for thousands of houses.

21
00:00:57,413 --> 00:00:59,173
Some places were engulfed in flames.

22
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:00,636
And as of 2nd January,

23
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:03,470
55 people have been declared d3ad.

24
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:06,284
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says that

25
00:01:06,284 --> 00:01:08,890
this situation is a battle against time.

26
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,938
Rescue operations are underway

27
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,768
and efforts are being made

28
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,645
to save the trapped people.

29
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:15,935
But on 2nd January,

30
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:18,523
another unfortunate incident 
took place in this country.

31
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:20,158
A Japan Airlines airplane

32
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:24,606
crashed with a Japan Coast 
Guard aircraft in Tokyo airport.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,924
Thereafter, both planes caught on fire.

34
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:30,548
"Japan Airlines plane has caught fire

35
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,548
at Tokyo's Hanida Airport.

36
00:01:32,548 --> 00:01:33,770
And all runways,

37
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,335
at the airport, have been closed."

38
00:01:35,665 --> 00:01:37,686
This Japan Coast Guard aircraft

39
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:40,608
was getting ready to help 
people affected by the earthquake.

40
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,095
Fortunately, all the people in the other plane

41
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:45,513
were evacuated safely.

42
00:01:45,513 --> 00:01:49,892
But 5 out of 6 crew members in 
the Coast Guard aircraft lost their lives.

43
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:51,717
The 29-year-old plane captain

44
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:53,772
was the only one who could survive.

45
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:55,486
Two big questions arise here.

46
00:01:55,486 --> 00:02:00,070
First, why are there so many 
earthquakes and tsunamis in Japan?

47
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,509
Second, how does Japan 
deal with these disasters?

48
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:07,404
Because if an earthquake of the same 
magnitude had hit any other country,

49
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:09,840
perhaps, thousands of people 
would have lost their lives.

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,211
The d3ath toll in Japan is 
below 100 as of now.

51
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:16,072
How does Japan protect itself against such circumstances?

52
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:17,683
Let's understand this in this video.

53
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,604
The earthquake that just hit Japan

54
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:32,518
is named the 2024 Sea of Japan earthquake

55
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:35,266
or the Noto Peninsula earthquake.

56
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:39,204
You can see its exact location 
on this map on the screen.

57
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:42,111
There's a region called the Noto Peninsula in Japan.

58
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,207
You have read about peninsulas in school.

59
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:45,707
It is a piece of land

60
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,272
surrounded by water on three sides.

61
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:49,786
The epicentre of this earthquake was located here.

62
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:52,518
The Sea of Japan, 
in the west of the country.

63
00:02:52,518 --> 00:02:55,960
It is 500 km away from Tokyo, Japan's capital.

64
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,469
But even so,

65
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,476
this earthquake was felt in Tokyo.

66
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:02,031
Now, our first question is,

67
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:04,620
why do so many earthquakes take place in Japan?

68
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,082
The answer to this 
is hidden in the map.

69
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:08,186
Look at this map.

70
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:12,384
This is the map of the Earth's 
16 major tectonic plates.

71
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:16,057
Tectonic plates are the outer-most layer of the Earth,

72
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:18,711
made up of the Earth's crust 
and the upper part of the mantle.

73
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:21,828
The heat that is generated in Earth's core,

74
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:23,994
releases convection currents

75
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:27,491
which causes the tectonic plates to move slowly.

76
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,462
These are the 16 main tectonic plates

77
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:32,604
that move slowly year after year.

78
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:34,626
When they collide with each other,

79
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:36,437
earthquakes happen.

80
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:38,720
So, the countries and the areas

81
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,263
that lie on the boundaries of the tectonic plates

82
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,162
are prone to earthquakes the most.

83
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:46,196
And the thing about Japan is that

84
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:48,121
it is situated at a place where

85
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:51,642
four tectonic plates come together.

86
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:53,892
The Pacific plate, the Philippine plate,

87
00:03:53,892 --> 00:03:56,789
the Eurasian plate, and 
the North American plate.

88
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:58,483
This is the biggest reason why

89
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:00,920
so many earthquakes are seen in Japan.

90
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,501
Among them, the Pacific plate stands out a bit.

91
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,991
Since it has the highest amount of tectonic activity.

92
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:10,024
So, the boundary of the Pacific plate

93
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:12,867
is known as the Pacific Ring of Fire.

94
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:16,890
Because this causes the highest 
number of earthquakes in the world.

95
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,438
As well as the highest number of volcanoes. 

96
00:04:20,438 --> 00:04:23,382
To some extent, this is true for the other plates as well.

97
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:25,325
And the countries located on their boundaries

98
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:28,274
witness a higher frequency of earthquakes.

99
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:31,248
For example, if you see India's northern boundary,

100
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:33,835
the boundary between the Indian and Eurasian plates,

101
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:36,362
that passes through Nepal,

102
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:38,049
amidst the Himalayan mountains,

103
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:40,948
this causes devastating earthquakes in Nepal.

104
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,831
The earthquakes in North India,

105
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:45,178
in Delhi and its surrounding regions,

106
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:47,600
in most cases, their epicentre

107
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,792
lies between these two plates.

108
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,941
Compare this with regions like 
Australia, Russia or Europe,

109
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:56,788
where you rarely see any earthquakes.

110
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:58,603
When was the last time you heard about

111
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:00,367
a terrible earthquake in Australia?

112
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,739
It's not like there have been 
no earthquakes in Australia at all.

113
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:06,487
But the regions that lie in 
the middle of the tectonic plates,

114
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:08,865
get earthquakes at a lower frequency.

115
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:10,698
And when earthquakes do occur,

116
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:12,211
they are not as devastating.

117
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:14,019
And the reason behind this is that

118
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:17,645
these major tectonic plates are 
made up of minor tectonic plates.

119
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:21,246
And, at times, the collision 
between the major tectonic plates

120
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:24,121
can be felt even in the middle of the plate.

121
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,004
But depending on the way 
that these main tectonic plates

122
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:28,746
collide with each other,

123
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,020
various types of boundaries can be formed.

124
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,290
Such as the Convergent boundary,

125
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,171
when one plate collides and slips under the other.

126
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:37,493
Or Divergent boundary,

127
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:39,802
where both plates move away from each other.

128
00:05:39,802 --> 00:05:41,414
Or Transform boundary,

129
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:45,106
when both plates move parallel against each other.

130
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:47,621
Among these, the most dangerous earthquakes

131
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:49,706
occur when convergent or 
transform boundaries are formed.

132
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:52,313
And the boundary of the Pacific plate

133
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:53,950
is a convergent boundary.

134
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,658
It has a specific sub-type

135
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:57,278
known as the Subduction Zone.

136
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:58,483
In the Subduction Zone,

137
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,555
causes the most powerful earthquakes

138
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:02,671
because in this type of collision,

139
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:04,595
when one plate collides with another,

140
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:06,478
it goes right under the other

141
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:08,001
submerging into the mantle.

142
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,668
And when this happens,

143
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:10,717
as you can see in the diagram,

144
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:12,954
a deep cavity or hole is formed under the sea

145
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:14,669
on the boundaries of the two plates,

146
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:16,480
which is called a Trench.

147
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:20,000
These underwater trenches are 
often the deepest point in the ocean.

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,583
They can be 3 to 4 kilometres 
deeper than the surrounding seabed.  

149
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,243
The deepest point on Earth in underwater

150
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:28,483
known as the Mariana Trench.

151
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:32,836
This trench is 10.9 kilometres deep.

152
00:06:32,836 --> 00:06:35,461
In Mariana Trench, the point Challenger Deep

153
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,168
is the deepest point in any ocean and on Earth.

154
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:39,159
You would have heard about it a lot.

155
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,554
But perhaps, you might not know that

156
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:45,750
There is a deep trench in the East of Japan,

157
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,564
known as the Japan Trench.

158
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:51,008
The depth of this trench is 8.4 km.

159
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,424
There are very few countries in the world

160
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:56,327
that are located so close to such deep sea.

161
00:06:56,327 --> 00:06:57,610
Look at this map.

162
00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:59,335
This map shows you

163
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,450
the depth of the sea in 
different parts of the world.

164
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,703
The lighter the colour,

165
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:05,209
the shallower the ocean.

166
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,406
And the darker the colour,

167
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:07,925
the deeper the ocean.

168
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:09,584
Look around most of the countries.

169
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:11,572
Indian coastlines,

170
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:13,086
African coastlines,

171
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:14,404
South American coastlines

172
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:15,710
they are shown in a light colour.

173
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,835
But zoom in and look at Japan.

174
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:20,460
On the right side of Japan,

175
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,516
there is a massive dark area.

176
00:07:23,516 --> 00:07:24,909
This is the Japan Trench.

177
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:26,341
And through it crosses,

178
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:28,666
our imaginary Ring of Fire.

179
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,141
The Pacific Ring of Fire.

180
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:32,145
Due to the movement of the tectonic plate,

181
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:34,211
such horrific earthquakes are caused,

182
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:36,002
the sea is so deep here,

183
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:39,639
most number of volcanoes are found here,

184
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,748
and due to this,

185
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:43,420
the area that gets the most 
number of tsunamis,

186
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,827
is the country of Japan.

187
00:07:45,827 --> 00:07:48,408
Japan's coastline is very close to this trench,

188
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:52,132
which means that the tsunami waves 
have to travel only a short distance

189
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:54,747
and there isn't sufficient time for issue warning.

190
00:07:54,747 --> 00:07:55,752
For this reason,

191
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:59,087
Japan is at the highest risk from tsunamis.

192
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:00,954
In fact, the word tsunami

193
00:08:00,954 --> 00:08:03,020
is derived from Japanese.

194
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,932
Tsu-Nami

195
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:05,865
is made up of Tsu and Nami.

196
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:07,211
Tsu means harbour

197
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:08,514
and Nami means wave,

198
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:09,719
meaning harbour-wave.

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,559
Harbour is also known as a seaport.

200
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,320
Since there were so many tsunamis in Japan,

201
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,689
when the news of the Japanese 
tsunamis spread all over the world,

202
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:20,392
the word tsunami became popular

203
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:23,431
and people started using it since then.

204
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:26,299
Approximately 90% of the world's earthquakes

205
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,202
take place in this Pacific Ring of Fire.

206
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:31,707
And approximately 75% of active volcanoes

207
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:33,043
are also found here.

208
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:34,910
Since the geography of this area is such,

209
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,389
historically, Japan has always been

210
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:38,845
in a danger zone.

211
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:40,707
But perhaps this is why Japan

212
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:42,527
has been at the forefront

213
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:47,082
at controlling the damage caused 
by earthquakes and tsunamis.

214
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:49,248
What does Japan do exactly?

215
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:51,495
Before talking about it, I'd like to tell you that

216
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:54,119
if you want to learn more about Japan's history,

217
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:56,758
there are amazing audiobooks on KUKU FM,

218
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:59,475
such as this one talking about Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

219
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:00,784
It is a 1.5 hour long audiobook,

220
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:03,370
that tells you the story of 
the nuclear bombing of the two cities.

221
00:09:03,895 --> 00:09:05,328
Apart from this, there is an audiobook on

222
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:07,741
Oppenheimer: The Father of The Atom Bomb.

223
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:11,580
There are numerous audiobooks 
on KUKU FM across various topics.

224
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,006
Whether it is fiction, history, geography or politics.

225
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:17,064
Overall, it is an amazing audio-learning platform

226
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:19,504
where you can listen to books.

227
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:21,217
In case you haven't already,

228
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:22,707
do check it out,

229
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:25,189
there's a link with a big discount in the description.

230
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,748
And now let's get back to the topic.

231
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,903
The buildings built in Japan have to 
meet strict earthquake-proof standards.

232
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,703
There are three standards.

233
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:36,245
The lowest is the Taishin standard.

234
00:09:36,245 --> 00:09:38,132
The requirement mandates the

235
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:44,099
minimum thickness of the pillars, 
walls, and beams of the buildings. 

236
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:46,616
So that if an earthquake shakes the building,

237
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:48,757
the building can resist it.

238
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:50,615
Second is the Seishin standard

239
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,247
which is recommended for tall buildings

240
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:54,226
where they are required to

241
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,949
install dampers to absorb the earthquake's energy.

242
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,642
They need to put large, thick rubber mats 
under the foundation of the building.

243
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,793
These rubber mats absorb the 
vibrations of earthquakes very well.

244
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:11,085
But there is a third standard, 
which is even more strict,

245
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:13,708
the most advanced standard,
the Menshin Standard.

246
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:17,750
In this, the entire structure of the 
building is isolated from the ground.

247
00:10:18,093 --> 00:10:20,593
Layers of lead, steel, and rubber are installed 

248
00:10:20,593 --> 00:10:24,341
so that the building moves independently of the ground.

249
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:26,173
Even if the ground shakes, 
the building can remain stable.

250
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:29,622
This iconic Skytree tower in Tokyo city, 

251
00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:32,006
was built using the same standard.

252
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,334
This is one of the most earthquake-resistant buildings in the city.

253
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,785
When the horrific Tohoku earthquake hit Japan in 2011,

254
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:41,230
the magnitude of that earthquake was 9.0.

255
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,323
This building did not even get a scratch.

256
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:44,590
On the other hand,

257
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,106
Japan has adopted many strategies 
to protect itself against tsunamis,

258
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:49,279
although they haven't been as successful

259
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,812
as those protecting Japan against earthquakes.

260
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:53,505
They have built tsunami-controlled forests.

261
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:55,737
Planting a large number of trees

262
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:58,003
to stop the force of tsunamis.

263
00:10:58,003 --> 00:10:59,555
They have built coastal dikes,

264
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:01,068
which look like this.

265
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:03,751
These are long structures built of stones.

266
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:05,966
These dikes are very expensive to build,

267
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:09,357
but they can successfully reduce the impact of tsunamis.

268
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:12,730
Apart from these, tsunami evacuation towers are built.

269
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,386
In areas with a high-risk of tsunami 
and a significant population,

270
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:18,759
since people do not get a lot of time for evacuation,

271
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,433
they are told to take shelter in these towers,

272
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:21,653
located at a high point,

273
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:23,618
to be protected from the tsunamis.

274
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:26,048
They have improved their warning systems.

275
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:27,969
Evacuation drills are regularly conducted,

276
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:30,616
to help the locals understand

277
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,790
what they need to do in case of a tsunami.

278
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,774
And how to prepare for rescue operations.

279
00:11:35,774 --> 00:11:38,900
And finally, they have built walls near the sea.

280
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,347
Sea walls.

281
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:43,347
Japan has a 22,000-mile-long coastline

282
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:48,087
40% of which is surrounded 
by these concrete sea walls.

283
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:51,355
But, unfortunately, these walls 
are not always effective.

284
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:53,175
As it happened in 2011.

285
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:54,421
Watch this video.

286
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:05,887
The earthquake that caused this tsunami

287
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:08,608
was the most powerful earthquake in Japan's history.

288
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:13,383
This tsunami caused the 
Fukushima nuclear disaster too.

289
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:15,760
Nuclear reactors were damaged,

290
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,280
leading to radiation leaks

291
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,230
that spread over the Pacific Ocean.

292
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,439
The 2011 earthquake and tsunami

293
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:23,690
was the most devastating in Japan's history.

294
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,391
Around 20,000 people lost their lives in it.

295
00:12:26,391 --> 00:12:30,026
After this, their government made their standards stricter.

296
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:31,589
Thankfully, this year's disaster

297
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:34,238
did not turn out to be as dangerous and fatal.

298
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:35,764
If you found this video informative,

Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

300
00:12:38,822 --> 00:12:42,460
The most dangerous nuclear disaster in the world.

301
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,449
It is explained in this video.

302
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:45,800
Thank you very much!
