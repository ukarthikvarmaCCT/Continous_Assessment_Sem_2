1
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:46,024
"We are proud of our country"

2
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:47,861
"We are proud!"

3
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:53,493
"We will live in victory
and die in victory"

4
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:55,564
"Die in victory"

5
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:59,412
"O Country, we will decorate
your character"

6
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:03,132
"Come, we will guard you
against evil"

7
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:16,436
"Every drop of my blood
is for guarding you"

8
00:01:16,612 --> 00:01:24,172
"Every drop of my blood
is for guarding you"

9
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:31,572
"Every drop of my blood
is for guarding you"

10
00:01:31,652 --> 00:01:39,212
"Every drop of my blood
is for guarding you"

11
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:47,316
"We are proud of our country"

12
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:49,148
"We are proud!'

13
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:54,709
"We will live in victory
and die in victory"

14
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:56,852
"Die in victory"

15
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:06,032
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
- He is a murderer!

16
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:09,592
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
- He is a murderer!

17
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:12,992
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
- He is a murderer!

18
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:16,112
Hang Arjun!
- Hang him! Hang him!

19
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,712
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
- He is a murderer!

20
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:22,672
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
- He is a murderer!

21
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:45,752
(Brakes squeal)

22
00:02:46,272 --> 00:02:49,432
Hang Arjun!
- Hang him! Hang him!

23
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:52,792
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
- He is a murderer!

24
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,192
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
- He is a murderer!

25
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:59,152
Arjun Ranawat is a killer!
- He is a murderer!

26
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:02,632
Hang Arjun!
- Hang him! Hang him!

27
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:24,072
Hang Arjun!
- Hang him! Hang him!

28
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:27,232
Hang Arjun!
- Hang him! Hang him!

29
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:29,112
Hang Arjun!

30
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:12,912
Your Honor.

31
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:15,712
This is ACP Arjun Ranawat.

32
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:17,912
He barged into the prime
minister's farm house..

33
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,912
..on the night of 1st November..

34
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:23,352
..and brutally killed the
deputy prime minister..

35
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:27,552
..Badrinath Trivedi,
his son, Munna Trivedi..

36
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:30,872
..the police commissioner
Yeshwant's son..

37
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:32,192
..Chandrakant Deshpande..

38
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:35,872
..police inspector Avasthi,
advocate Kulkarni..

39
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:38,632
..the six MLAs of the reigning
political party..

40
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:42,032
..and counting some government
and police officers..

41
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:47,552
..all in all, 18 people.

42
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:53,835
Your Honor.

43
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:59,195
He isn't the guardian of
the law, but its abuser.

44
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:02,275
With this cold blooded massacre..

45
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:04,075
..not only has he maligned..

46
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:07,155
..the government and police,
but even humanity.

47
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:10,675
These are some of the photographs..

48
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:13,275
..taken from the crime scene,
Your Honor.

49
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:21,515
Your Honor.

50
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:23,995
The police requests the accused..

51
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:28,915
..to be kept in remand for
fifteen days to investigate..

52
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:33,235
..this brutal massacre
and the reason for it.

53
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:41,915
Arjun Ranawat, do you want to say
anything about these accusations?

54
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:43,344
No.

55
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:47,515
Do you have a lawyer?
- No.

56
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:52,955
Would you wish the court
to appoint a lawyer for you?

57
00:05:53,515 --> 00:05:54,030
No.

58
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:59,978
The government has accused you
of killing 18 innocent civilians.

59
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:04,538
It has asked for a remand of
15 days for investigation.

60
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:08,405
Do you want anything
during this time?

61
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,375
Do you have the need for anything?

62
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,510
Yes, I do.
- What is it?

63
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:15,888
Death.

64
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:31,014
The accused, Arjun Ranawat,
is placed into police custody..

65
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:33,214
..for 15 days in remand.

66
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:39,164
'While claiming that
he was perfectly sane..'

67
00:06:39,597 --> 00:06:43,677
'..Ranawat said that he has committed
this massacre in sound mind.'

68
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:47,774
'When the judge asked him
whether he needed anything..'

69
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,288
'..he answered what he
had said before. Death.'

70
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:53,156
'Vandana Sajnani, Aaj Tak, Mumbai.'

71
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:35,119
Yeshwant Deshpande.

72
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:39,633
Is this the charge
sheet you've prepared?

73
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:42,467
Is this it? Just a murderer?

74
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:47,189
He isn't a murderer! He is a demon!

75
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:51,430
Come. Look at this! Look at this!

76
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:56,835
He snatched away my son, my brother
and my son-in-law from me!

77
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:59,014
He wiped off the vermilion
from the foreheads..

78
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:00,494
..of my daughter-in-law
and my daughter.

79
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:02,826
He even got your son, didn't he?

80
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:04,921
Aren't you sad about that?

81
00:08:06,254 --> 00:08:10,614
He didn't leave anyone to
light our funeral pyres.

82
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:14,174
He vanquished our bloodline!
Our dynasty!

83
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:16,652
Listen to me, Tyagi.

84
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,420
Bad character.

85
00:08:20,414 --> 00:08:21,293
Corruption.

86
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,310
Bad thoughts.

87
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:26,733
Betrayal of the country. Even to
the extent of calling him a traitor.

88
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,879
Accuse him of every crime
written in your law book..

89
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,160
..and label him a lawless character.

90
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:34,906
Slap all the sections
of your law on him!

91
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,191
Release his chains.

92
00:09:21,324 --> 00:09:23,044
Sign these documents.

93
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:49,231
Arjun Ranawat.

94
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,832
You have killed my only son.

95
00:09:52,823 --> 00:09:55,143
Until the court punishes you..

96
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:59,767
..I will give you a new death
every day in this prison.

97
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:03,447
Deshpande, he hasn't signed
these documents.

98
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:06,247
He has placed his life
into death's hands.

99
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:07,384
Please come.

100
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:41,965
Son.

101
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:44,951
Why did you put down your
weapons in the court today?

102
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:49,951
Why don't you tell the world
why you massacred them?

103
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:53,563
Why are you asking for
death for yourself, son?

104
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,217
Why are you doing it?

105
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,790
Because I have performed my last rites.

106
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:06,889
I wish freedom from my body
and this birth.

107
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,421
Mother.

108
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,314
From today, both you and Rakhi..

109
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:18,127
..please don't come
to meet me here.

110
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,820
Because in the Hindu religion..

111
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:25,248
..mothers and sisters don't attend
funerals and enter cemeteries.

112
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:31,794
I'll leave now, Mother.

113
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,208
We were to be together for
just this long in this birth.

114
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:40,315
Don't cry when I die.
I'll be back again.

115
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:49,114
Ask your God to make me
your son next time too.

116
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:09,649
Respected Mr. Samar Singh.

117
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:13,849
My final salute to you
and your principles.

118
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:18,409
I've walked away
from your principles..

119
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,769
..this uniform and
this police force.

120
00:12:22,982 --> 00:12:25,022
I have a final request of you, sir.

121
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:29,007
Please don't say 'Truth always triumphs'
ever again.

122
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:36,609
Because the truth is that in
this eunuch-like society..

123
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:38,329
..lies..

124
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:41,489
..unlawfulness..

125
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:45,569
..and injustice are always victorious.

126
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:48,888
I want to tell you, sir.

127
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:52,129
We soldiers are not
mere government machinery.

128
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:02,968
Outside the police station,
even we have a life.

129
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:08,102
We don't know where we lost it
while walking on your given path.

130
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:35,368
So, you're here still.
You haven't gone to the temple.

131
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:37,528
Didn't I tell you, son?

132
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:39,874
Mother. What will I do
going to the temple?

133
00:13:40,464 --> 00:13:42,224
You've worshipped your
body for too long now.

134
00:13:42,315 --> 00:13:44,195
Come and worship God too, son.

135
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:45,889
(Sighs)

136
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:49,608
You want me to go to the
temple and pray to God?

137
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:51,715
Yes. I'll be very grateful to you.

138
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:55,996
Where are you taking me?
- Come here. Sit down.

139
00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:57,835
Okay.

140
00:13:59,476 --> 00:14:01,036
'Hail the Goddess Jagdambe,
Hail Goddess Durga"

141
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:02,436
'Hail Goddess Kali,
Hail Goddess Saraswati"

142
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:04,076
You crazy boy, what are you doing?

143
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:07,596
Don't you see, mother?
I am praying to my God.

144
00:14:10,712 --> 00:14:12,072
It's been truly said.

145
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:16,004
God can't be everywhere
at one time.

146
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:18,391
That's why he created mother.

147
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:24,764
Mother, you are my
temple and every deity.

148
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:26,495
Are you crazy?

149
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,410
A mortal man is never compared
to God, son.

150
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,452
Is it so?

151
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,570
Do you remember
the '1984 riots, Mother?

152
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,410
When a child was crying
over his dead parents?

153
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:41,049
God hadn't come at that time.
You had, Mother.

154
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,169
My real mother had
just given birth to me.

155
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:49,676
You've given me my life though.
My existence is because of you.

156
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,170
Only because of you, Mother.

157
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:58,728
I gave birth to Rakhi.
But you're a piece of my heart.

158
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:02,942
I didn't ask for anything
after getting you.

159
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,490
Why are you lying, Mother?

160
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,530
You pray for brother's wellbeing
from morning to evening..

161
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,409
..and yet you say that you
don't ask God for anything?

162
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:17,369
Rakhi, keep quiet.
You're just jealous.

163
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:19,916
Because mother loves me more.

164
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:23,489
What? I'm jealous of you?

165
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:25,313
My foot!

166
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:26,693
Oh, God!

167
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:29,811
She's in the mood to fight.

168
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,500
I haven't come to fight.

169
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,490
I have come to tell you
that I'm going to college..

170
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:38,100
..and I've taken Rs.1000
from your wallet.

171
00:15:38,226 --> 00:15:40,626
Did you see that, Mother?
Robbery in a policeman's house.

172
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,691
I didn't rob anyone. I've just
taken what is mine by right.

173
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:46,375
By the way,
I have served breakfast.

174
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:49,149
When you both mother and son
complete your tearful reunion..

175
00:15:49,255 --> 00:15:51,815
..please have it. I'll be very grateful.
I'll leave now.

176
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:54,109
Bye. Bye, Mom.

177
00:15:55,451 --> 00:15:57,891
Did you see that, mother?
Rakhi has grown up.

178
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:01,801
Yes, son. When the daughter grows up..

179
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,600
..a mother worries even more.

180
00:16:04,717 --> 00:16:06,037
What are you talking about, mother?

181
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:08,508
Does a cow ever feel that
her horns are heavy?

182
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:10,944
You worry about Rakhi's marriage,
don't you?

183
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:13,016
Yes.
- Don't worry.

184
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:17,655
Your son will get his sister married
with such pomp and splendor..

185
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:20,121
..that the whole world will be stunned.

186
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:25,016
(Police siren wails)

187
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:26,056
(Brakes squeal)

188
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:31,016
Greetings, Lukkha brother!

189
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:36,599
Did you see, sir? Even a hero's not
as famous as Hakim Lukkha is! (Laughs)

190
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:37,156
Come on!

191
00:16:37,215 --> 00:16:40,935
What is the hurry, sir?
I am human too.

192
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:43,203
Why are you dragging me
like a beast?

193
00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:45,683
Sir, will I get a smoke?

194
00:16:45,816 --> 00:16:47,736
Shut up and walk, you wretch.

195
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:50,962
Let the judge get you
in police custody once..

196
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:53,498
..I'll give you good cigarettes
in the lock up after that.

197
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:55,562
That will be decided
with the judge's verdict.

198
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:56,342
Your Honor.

199
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,943
When these police
men were accusing..

200
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:03,363
..Hakim Lukkha of cutting off the..

201
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:05,519
..prostitutes nose
and ears, he wasn't..

202
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:09,713
..in Mumbai city forget
about Grant Road.

203
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:13,018
He had gone to Lucknow.

204
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:14,975
For the party's work.

205
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:17,708
Your Honor.

206
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:20,372
This is the proof of the
police's wretchedness.

207
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,508
This is the air ticket to Lucknow.

208
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:26,668
This is the register of
the guesthouse in Lucknow..

209
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:33,081
And Your Honor, this is the manager
of that guesthouse in Lucknow.

210
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:35,375
Your Honor.

211
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:39,055
This lawyer is lying!
Hakim Lukkha is a pimp.

212
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,826
This scoundrel whores innocent girls.

213
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:46,001
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that, your honor?

214
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:48,877
This is the respected police
of our Mumbai city.

215
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:51,655
They abuse people
right here in court.

216
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:53,593
ACP Arjun Ranawat.

217
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:58,819
If you use any abusive and vulgar
language in this court the next time..

218
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:01,765
..you will be suspended.

219
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:08,118
This time, I'm letting you go
with just a warning.

220
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:12,601
Please don't waste the court's time
by bringing such matters here.

221
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:17,558
The accused is released honorably.

222
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,215
I've told you a thousand times.

223
00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:26,791
Be respectful in the court.

224
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:28,695
They are ripping our shirts apart.

225
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,816
And you're saying that
we should respect them?

226
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:36,789
Didn't I show you your place
in court, Mr. Arjun?

227
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:40,882
I had said it.
I had announced it, Lawyer.

228
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:44,256
That this time too,
Hakim Lukkha will be released.

229
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,296
Why? What did you do?

230
00:18:49,114 --> 00:18:50,394
Actually, sir.

231
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:53,193
Messing with me is
dangerous for you.

232
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:55,954
And dangerous for your sister, too.

233
00:18:57,954 --> 00:19:01,594
I've heard that your sister
is very beautiful, sir.

234
00:19:03,382 --> 00:19:04,942
No, Arjun!

235
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:22,341
Wait, Arjun! I say, stop it.

236
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,010
(Glass shatters)

237
00:19:41,336 --> 00:19:44,376
I say, leave him, Arjun.
I said leave him alone.

238
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:50,083
Compose yourself! Are you crazy?

239
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:51,354
Get up, Brother Lukkha. Get up.

240
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,395
Hey, Kulkarni. Take this pimp away!

241
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:55,962
Hey, explain it to your hero!

242
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,483
These wrestling antics of his
will prove very expensive to him!

243
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:00,283
I'll have his uniform snatched!

244
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:04,175
You will have my uniform snatched?
Come on.

245
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:05,349
Arjun.

246
00:20:05,882 --> 00:20:06,682
(Snaps finger)

247
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,629
Hey, take him away.
- I am going.

248
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:11,011
But explain to this hero.

249
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:14,549
Enmity with a lawyer
will prove very costly.

250
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,060
Come on, Brother Lukkha. Let's go.

251
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:46,683
Enough, Arjun. It is enough.

252
00:20:47,443 --> 00:20:50,643
What enough? You always stop me.

253
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:53,843
That wretched Hakim Lukkha..

254
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:56,763
..spat on our faces and
we couldn't do anything.

255
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:58,455
And you tell me to stop?

256
00:20:59,602 --> 00:21:02,082
See this. Do you see this?

257
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,861
The government has hung
a gun around our waist.

258
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,019
But we can't use it.

259
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:12,941
And those scoundrels shoot
in the middle of the street.

260
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:17,221
And what do we do? What do we do?

261
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:22,767
We just take those pimps
into the magistrate's presence.

262
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:27,128
And then Kulkarni
comes and releases them.

263
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:34,489
And what do we do?
We hold this in our hands and stand.

264
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:42,033
Get up.That pimp is not wworth
irritating your brains.

265
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:45,269
Let's go!
- You go. I'll be here a while.

266
00:21:45,524 --> 00:21:47,724
Yes, why will you come?

267
00:21:47,964 --> 00:21:50,001
It's time for your angel to come.

268
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:52,165
You've started it all over again?
- You scoundrel.

269
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,404
Why are you shy of speaking
what's in your heart since a long time?

270
00:21:55,534 --> 00:21:57,924
She has expressed her love
to you a thousand times over.

271
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,180
And you..

272
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:00,947
Haider, please go.

273
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:02,124
I'll go.

274
00:22:02,484 --> 00:22:04,684
It's bad to suggest
anything to anyone nowadays.

275
00:22:05,013 --> 00:22:08,493
And listen, don't drink
a lot. You'll be driving.

276
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:26,282
Jannat, did your lover give
you a flying kiss today too?

277
00:22:26,664 --> 00:22:28,155
Thank you for your sympathy.

278
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:32,330
Jannat, all rich people
are at your feet.

279
00:22:32,397 --> 00:22:34,464
And you are dying for a policeman?

280
00:22:34,535 --> 00:22:36,148
What does he have?

281
00:22:39,403 --> 00:22:40,766
You won't understand, my dear.

282
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:45,060
Rich and generous people
are found in this bar.

283
00:22:47,318 --> 00:22:49,346
But l can see only lust and hunger..

284
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:53,354
..in the eyes of every man here.

285
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:56,127
But Arjun.

286
00:22:57,244 --> 00:23:01,000
l see respect and conscience
in Arjun''s eyes.

287
00:23:01,335 --> 00:23:05,441
You crazy girl, till wwhen wwill
you wait for him like this?

288
00:23:05,882 --> 00:23:07,090
For my whole life.

289
00:23:07,258 --> 00:23:11,217
And if that is less, l will
give my next life to him too.

290
00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:15,111
This ring that l wwear in my neck.

291
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,564
Only Arjun will make me wwear this.

292
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,675
She wwon't understand.

293
00:23:28,777 --> 00:23:29,977
(Brakes squeal)

294
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:33,702
(Engine not starting)

295
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:53,959
(Tires squealing)

296
00:24:20,982 --> 00:24:22,302
Did you recognize me?

297
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:28,381
Lukkha. Hakim Lukkha.

298
00:24:30,492 --> 00:24:32,012
(Laughs)

299
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,035
What are you staring at, sir?

300
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:40,623
You'll just have to speak
to me with respect, okay?

301
00:24:40,996 --> 00:24:44,854
Respectable people are
spoken to with respect.

302
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,340
(Bottle shatters)

303
00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:55,149
Who do you call a pimp?

304
00:24:59,197 --> 00:24:59,717
(Snaps finger)

305
00:24:59,837 --> 00:25:01,077
See this street.

306
00:25:02,237 --> 00:25:03,717
It is deserted.

307
00:25:04,578 --> 00:25:06,858
Neither a man,
nor any sign of humans.

308
00:25:07,557 --> 00:25:09,477
Look here too. Look.

309
00:25:10,597 --> 00:25:12,797
You can't see anyone till afar.

310
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:18,232
If I kill you here right now..

311
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:22,321
..nobody will get any
proof or any witness..

312
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:26,206
..about who killed
ACP Arjun Ranawat.

313
00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:30,086
There will only be your photo
in the newspaper tomorrow.

314
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:35,489
And your sister will be
in my jeep from tomorrow.

315
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:39,347
I'll leave now.

316
00:25:39,686 --> 00:25:40,286
(Snaps finger)

317
00:25:40,446 --> 00:25:41,926
Think about what I told you.

318
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:50,774
Work for me. Or else,
an unknown death may occur. (Laughs)

319
00:25:56,242 --> 00:26:02,122
'He is correct.
A lonely street, unknown death.'

320
00:26:03,618 --> 00:26:05,098
'What if I kill him here?'

321
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:09,041
Hey, Lukkha.

322
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:37,011
Yes, tell me.
What do you want to tell me?

323
00:26:37,752 --> 00:26:39,992
Thanks for the suggestion.

324
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:42,258
Suggestion?

325
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,305
(Groans)

326
00:26:53,157 --> 00:26:54,437
Hey!

327
00:26:55,252 --> 00:26:59,572
(Gunshot)

328
00:27:21,491 --> 00:27:23,251
(Screaming in pain)

329
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,127
(Screaming in pain)

330
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:59,029
Look here. Empty street.

331
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:03,662
Look here.
No man, nor any sign of humans.

332
00:28:10,713 --> 00:28:13,184
(Screaming in pain)

333
00:28:25,733 --> 00:28:31,093
And the papers tomorrow will carry
your photograph, not mine.

334
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:33,066
Unknown death.

335
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,960
No!

336
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,710
No!

337
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,589
(Gunshot)

338
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:49,273
(Gunshot)

339
00:28:51,535 --> 00:28:56,535
(Gunshot)

340
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:08,716
Arjun Ranawat,
your activities last night..

341
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:11,276
..have shaken the entire city of Mumbai
and the government.

342
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:15,177
Your murdering spree has slandered
the police force's reputation.

343
00:29:15,328 --> 00:29:17,408
Look at this. Look at this
and look at this.

344
00:29:17,648 --> 00:29:19,376
While some are calling
us uniformed hooligans..

345
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:22,453
..others are calling us
uniformed devils.

346
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,521
You will have to bear
its punishment.

347
00:29:24,982 --> 00:29:26,202
Write on that paper..

348
00:29:26,524 --> 00:29:29,764
..that you lost your anger
and sanity and murdered them.

349
00:29:30,188 --> 00:29:32,708
I didn't massacre them
in anger or insanity.

350
00:29:33,284 --> 00:29:34,964
I did it in self-defense.

351
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,845
It was an act of self-defense.

352
00:29:36,986 --> 00:29:38,866
Act of self-defense? My foot!

353
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,496
Don't think me to be a fool.

354
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:46,070
One doesn't break 17 bones
in someone's body in self-defense.

355
00:29:46,155 --> 00:29:47,355
He doesn't make him
lay on his back..

356
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:50,099
..and empty the entire magazine
of his gun.

357
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:53,192
This is the autopsy report.

358
00:29:54,157 --> 00:29:57,997
Have you not read
the procedure code?

359
00:29:58,357 --> 00:30:01,197
You must warn a criminal first.

360
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:04,669
Then bullets are shot in the air
and later on the legs.

361
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:08,541
And then, you could inform
the control room too.

362
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:10,281
You are right, sir.

363
00:30:10,621 --> 00:30:12,261
I committed a huge mistake.

364
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,880
When his revolver was below my ear..

365
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:17,171
..and he was about to
press the trigger..

366
00:30:17,352 --> 00:30:19,592
..I should have called up
the control room.

367
00:30:20,024 --> 00:30:21,504
Then I should have fired
in the air once.

368
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:24,549
After that, I should have
fired at his legs.

369
00:30:25,206 --> 00:30:26,286
You are right, sir.

370
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,210
I committed such a huge mistake.

371
00:30:29,517 --> 00:30:32,997
Sir, that wretch was
talking about killing me..

372
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,372
..and making my sister
a courtesan.

373
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:39,107
At that time, I should have told him,
"Brother, please wait".

374
00:30:39,477 --> 00:30:43,677
"It is a crime to kill a police officer
and make his sister a courtesan."

375
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,578
I'm sorry, sir.

376
00:30:48,025 --> 00:30:49,945
But if I had walked on your path..

377
00:30:50,246 --> 00:30:51,526
..my name wouldn't be written here..

378
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:52,919
..but outside the police station..

379
00:30:52,973 --> 00:30:54,453
..on the list of personnel dead
in the line of fire.

380
00:30:55,698 --> 00:30:57,698
And you wouldn't be shouting here.

381
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:02,193
You would be shedding tears
over my bullet-ridden body..

382
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:05,717
..wrapping it in the Indian tricolor flag
and playing the bugle.

383
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:08,296
Shut up.

384
00:31:08,397 --> 00:31:10,597
There is a limit to insolence
and shamelessness.

385
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,897
Did you see that, sir?

386
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:17,094
I say, we should declare him a killer
and set an example for others.

387
00:31:17,368 --> 00:31:18,648
Why not, sir?

388
00:31:20,184 --> 00:31:22,344
If you want to clean up the
good-for-nothing and useless image..

389
00:31:22,737 --> 00:31:25,057
..of the police force with the
blood of an upright police officer..

390
00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:26,353
..you are most welcome.

391
00:31:28,642 --> 00:31:31,762
Nobody has any proof
that I did these killings.

392
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:37,519
Neither you, nor you were
present at the murder site.

393
00:31:39,823 --> 00:31:43,543
You can only declare me a killer,
but you can't prove it.

394
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:48,665
And I won't say this.
My lawyer will say this in court.

395
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,209
And nobody will have
any answer to this.

396
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:57,168
Sir..

397
00:31:57,768 --> 00:32:00,928
This Hakim Lukkha had
38 cases against him.

398
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,688
He had started thinking of the
police station as his house..

399
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:05,407
..his house as a brothel..

400
00:32:05,848 --> 00:32:09,128
..and police officers
like me as his pimp.

401
00:32:09,968 --> 00:32:11,368
What had we done to him?

402
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:14,779
Sir..

403
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:17,911
In 12 years of this police service..

404
00:32:19,202 --> 00:32:21,442
..I've died a thousand
deaths at their hands.

405
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:23,986
I had just two ways out.

406
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:30,390
Either I would live on Lukkha's scraps
and barter the law..

407
00:32:31,402 --> 00:32:34,242
..or I'd put down this uniform..

408
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:38,119
..and tolerate everything like a eunuch.

409
00:32:40,116 --> 00:32:41,396
No, sir.

410
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:46,195
I refused to be a pimp or eunuch.

411
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:51,547
Sir, if these criminals
can be released by court..

412
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:54,986
..and allowed to move around
like innocent civilians..

413
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:59,555
..then why can't I,
Arjun Ranawat, kill them..

414
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:03,621
..and move around like
an innocent civilian?

415
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,880
Why?

416
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,559
Do you want to say anything else?

417
00:33:12,244 --> 00:33:13,444
No, sir.

418
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:15,927
You may go.

419
00:33:23,258 --> 00:33:24,858
He is speaking the truth, sir.

420
00:33:26,022 --> 00:33:28,622
But sadly, what can be done?

421
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:32,778
That's what we will
have to think of, Jadhav..

422
00:33:34,699 --> 00:33:38,459
..what we'll have to do
in such a situation.

423
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:51,092
No, sir. Punishing Arjun
is not a solution to this problem.

424
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,750
What is the solution
to this problem?

425
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:55,001
Encounter!

426
00:33:55,978 --> 00:33:57,098
Encounter?

427
00:33:57,255 --> 00:34:00,255
Yes, we won't catch
them in a clash.

428
00:34:01,118 --> 00:34:04,878
We'll kill them.
We'll encounter them.

429
00:34:06,806 --> 00:34:11,446
When the criminals see this
terror hovering around them..

430
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,180
..they will see only two
ways out for themselves.

431
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:16,764
Give up or die.

432
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,460
Surrender or death.

433
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:26,007
And only then will the dream of
a crime-free country come true.

434
00:34:28,886 --> 00:34:30,686
Are you ready for this?

435
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,980
You ready the Crime Control
Squad, Mr. Samar Singh.

436
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:36,838
My government is with you.

437
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,687
Hands up!
Police? run.

438
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:28,650
This is too much, brother.

439
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:33,536
The police that would shiver in fear
when they'd hear of you..

440
00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:38,069
..the same police has now killed 27
of our men in only 13 days.

441
00:36:38,305 --> 00:36:38,945
Yes, brother.

442
00:36:39,493 --> 00:36:43,414
This Mumbai Police has shaken up
this same Mumbai city in 25 days..

443
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:46,277
..which we ruled for 25 years.

444
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:48,971
The police has become
synonymous with death today.

445
00:36:49,272 --> 00:36:51,272
They don't arrest or
ask for surrender.

446
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,620
That commissioner tells them
to kill directly.

447
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:57,068
Brother, that CM has backed the police.

448
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:59,739
Therefore, the lowliest of the officers..

449
00:37:00,002 --> 00:37:02,202
..laugh at Zafar Supari's face.

450
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:04,819
I'll tell you, brother.
Just say the word.

451
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:08,564
I'll go and blow up that
commissioner's head right away.

452
00:37:08,843 --> 00:37:12,563
I'll show the Mumbai police that
one must not touch a live snake.

453
00:37:23,844 --> 00:37:24,804
Majid.

454
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,189
Call that opposition leader
Kashi Trivedi.

455
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:33,504
Tell him to create a hullabaloo..

456
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:37,590
..by branding the police as the
murderers of the Dalits(low-caste sect)..

457
00:37:39,354 --> 00:37:41,834
..minorities and the innocent
in the parliament.

458
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:51,367
Through the accusations of
fake encounters in the press..

459
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,350
..make life difficult for the
policemen and the government.

460
00:37:56,284 --> 00:37:58,924
Shake up that CM.

461
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:04,381
I will show the CM
and the commissioner..

462
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:07,884
..that the government with whose
backing they prance about proudly..

463
00:38:08,893 --> 00:38:14,613
..is run by Zafar Supari
sitting in a foreign country.

464
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,613
Down with the killer police!

465
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:19,493
Down with the heartless government.

466
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:21,133
Down with the killer police!

467
00:38:21,193 --> 00:38:23,033
Down with the heartless government.

468
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:25,008
Down with the killer police!

469
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:26,973
Down with the uniformed hooligans!

470
00:38:27,064 --> 00:38:29,144
Down with the heartless government.

471
00:38:29,213 --> 00:38:31,133
Down with the killer police!

472
00:38:32,712 --> 00:38:35,672
Mr. Trivedi, if you want to
create a ruckus here too..

473
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,150
..just like at the parliament..

474
00:38:37,352 --> 00:38:38,952
..what is the meaning
of this meeting?

475
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:41,413
What is your problem after all?

476
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:44,516
I don't have a problem.
I have a question.

477
00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:47,246
Till when will your police..

478
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:50,452
..carry out bloodshed on the
streets of the city of Mumbai?

479
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:54,951
Until the last one of this
city's gangsters isn't dead.

480
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:59,908
Until we don't achieve the
objective of a crime-free state.

481
00:39:00,477 --> 00:39:02,717
Until then.
- Mr. Chief Minister..

482
00:39:02,947 --> 00:39:05,387
..please make your crazy
commissioner understand..

483
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:09,172
..that he needs to stop shedding the
blood of Dalits and minority groups.

484
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:14,446
Kashi Trivedi,
politicians like you shed blood.

485
00:39:14,864 --> 00:39:15,512
Not the police.

486
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:20,539
Who created fights in the country
regarding temples and mosques?

487
00:39:20,954 --> 00:39:22,074
You did.

488
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:24,437
The Brahmins against
Yadavs in Bihar..

489
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:26,664
..the Thakurs against
Dalits in UP..

490
00:39:27,015 --> 00:39:29,855
..and the Muslims against Hindus
in Gujarat. Who did all this?

491
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,370
You did.

492
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:36,287
Just for a few votes, you get a
brother to kill his own brother.

493
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:38,941
Then you warm yourselves
with their funeral pyres.

494
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:42,034
That's what politicians
like you do, not the police.

495
00:39:42,406 --> 00:39:45,006
Human rights violator!

496
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,499
Human rights violator!

497
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,380
You are accusing me? Me!

498
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:56,422
I'll topple Satyanarayan Joshi's
government in a snap. (Snaps finger)

499
00:39:57,774 --> 00:39:59,654
I'll topple your chair, understood?

500
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,020
I'll bring you down to a
constable from a commissioner.

501
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,079
(Laughs)

502
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:05,920
Kashi Trivedi.

503
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:09,625
Whose human rights
are you speaking about?

504
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:13,861
Those hooligans, who don't
consider humans as humans?

505
00:40:14,714 --> 00:40:17,194
Those who shoot
at innocent people?

506
00:40:17,497 --> 00:40:20,657
Who widow their wives
and orphan their children?

507
00:40:21,372 --> 00:40:25,852
Kashi Trivedi, are you
praising their human rights?

508
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,350
They aren't humans.

509
00:40:28,146 --> 00:40:30,146
How can we have a human
consideration for them?

510
00:40:32,028 --> 00:40:33,748
They are inhuman.

511
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:36,609
They just understand one language.

512
00:40:38,526 --> 00:40:39,446
This one.

513
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:43,218
Shut up! You mere police inspector!

514
00:40:43,504 --> 00:40:45,544
You're flying high on
their strength, aren't you?

515
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:48,919
This chief minister's
days are on thin ice now.

516
00:40:49,171 --> 00:40:51,106
I'll transfer this
commissioner as soon as..

517
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:52,423
..I become the chief minister.

518
00:40:52,662 --> 00:40:53,902
And as for you..

519
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:57,195
..if I don't make you
salute me everyday..

520
00:40:57,444 --> 00:40:59,844
..my name won't be Kashi Trivedi!

521
00:41:00,244 --> 00:41:02,724
Then listen to what I say too,
Kashi Trivedi.

522
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,249
The day I get some proof
against you..

523
00:41:08,418 --> 00:41:10,778
..you won't be sitting on
the chief minister's chair..

524
00:41:11,515 --> 00:41:13,115
..but on your funeral pyre.

525
00:41:14,623 --> 00:41:18,063
And I promise you, Kashi Trivedi.

526
00:41:19,787 --> 00:41:24,587
You won't even get one man
to shoulder your funeral.

527
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:42,161
Mr. Encounter Specialist.

528
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:44,258
You have turned this
city into Gestapo.

529
00:41:44,316 --> 00:41:46,046
You have colored the streets of
this city red with blood..

530
00:41:46,126 --> 00:41:47,021
..in the last 30 days.

531
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:48,219
What do you have to say about this?

532
00:41:48,301 --> 00:41:49,621
Is this not the death of democracy?

533
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,680
How long will you kill
in the name of humanity?

534
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:53,421
What is the difference between
the police and the hooligans?

535
00:41:53,488 --> 00:41:55,248
Is this encounter your
helplessness or greed?

536
00:41:55,323 --> 00:41:57,883
Encounter is murder of democracy.
It's dictatorship.

537
00:41:58,006 --> 00:41:59,841
What is the need of murdering
under the pretext of encounters?

538
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:06,299
It is necessary.
There is a necessity.

539
00:42:06,908 --> 00:42:08,148
What do you think?

540
00:42:08,405 --> 00:42:10,445
When we go to arrest them..

541
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:13,618
..do the criminals
wait with garlands for us?

542
00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:20,306
They welcome us with a spray of
bullets and dangerous weapons.

543
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,450
It is our moral right to shoot
in self-defense at that time.

544
00:42:24,993 --> 00:42:26,878
It is our democratic right.

545
00:42:28,681 --> 00:42:32,241
Do only criminals and
terrorists have human rights?

546
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,750
Doesn't a soldier
have any human rights?

547
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,200
Are we soldiers not human?

548
00:42:42,953 --> 00:42:44,513
Mr. Encounter Specialist.

549
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:47,425
Zafar Supari has
threatened to kill..

550
00:42:47,743 --> 00:42:49,463
..every person in the encounter squad.

551
00:42:51,353 --> 00:42:54,433
He has made a hit list of
the entire encounter squad.

552
00:43:15,813 --> 00:43:17,933
What hit list will that pimp make?

553
00:43:18,013 --> 00:43:19,573
We have made a hit list.

554
00:43:19,992 --> 00:43:21,352
Look at this.

555
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:24,392
Do you see these red marks?

556
00:43:25,133 --> 00:43:26,856
These are with God today.

557
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:30,490
Soon, the rest will be too.

558
00:43:32,636 --> 00:43:35,836
Take this hit list. Print it
in your newspaper tomorrow.

559
00:43:36,287 --> 00:43:39,967
The next time Zafar Supari
gives you a telephonic interview..

560
00:43:40,636 --> 00:43:45,236
..tell him that we have
started striking off his name..

561
00:43:46,616 --> 00:43:48,696
..from the ration cards.

562
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:07,861
(Brakes squeal)

563
00:44:16,636 --> 00:44:17,716
Bye!

564
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,330
Hello! Hey.

565
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,818
I've come to drop you till
your home. Won't you call me in?

566
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,378
l mean, tea or something?

567
00:44:24,773 --> 00:44:27,374
Oh, tea!

568
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:31,289
Yes, l am your lover, l love you.

569
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:33,397
l have that much right at least.

570
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:37,494
Okay. So come in, Mr.Vivek
Acharya. Please come in.

571
00:44:37,952 --> 00:44:41,037
You will be made to drink
tea and with that..

572
00:44:41,127 --> 00:44:43,102
..you wwill be introduced
to my brother too.

573
00:44:43,235 --> 00:44:47,053
What! Brother is at home..
l mean, is he home?

574
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:50,073
He is a policeman.
When he''s at home..

575
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:51,607
..when he is in the station,
when he..

576
00:44:52,066 --> 00:44:54,597
..goes to do someone''s encounter..

577
00:44:54,941 --> 00:44:56,819
..even the almighty
doesn't know that.

578
00:44:56,978 --> 00:45:00,073
Okay, Miss Rekha, l mean,
Miss Rakhi, l will leave.

579
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:05,192
Why? Don't you want
any tea or something?

580
00:45:05,385 --> 00:45:08,163
Tea? l won't even be able
to drink water now.

581
00:45:08,614 --> 00:45:11,020
Why? Aren't you scared of brother?

582
00:45:12,802 --> 00:45:15,915
Scared? The whole city is
afraid of your brother.

583
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,156
He speaks less with his mouth
and more with his gun.

584
00:45:22,384 --> 00:45:23,384
You fool!

585
00:45:23,857 --> 00:45:27,745
lf you don't meet brother, how
will you ask me for your hand?

586
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:30,162
Madam!That is your responsibility.

587
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:34,505
Mr.Vivek Acharya, son
of Justice Acharya.

588
00:45:35,203 --> 00:45:36,789
l will talk to my brother.

589
00:45:37,116 --> 00:45:39,576
But when will you talk to your dad?

590
00:45:39,744 --> 00:45:43,197
Leave him to me. Once that
our marriage case..

591
00:45:43,298 --> 00:45:48,303
..reaches in his court, his
decision will be in our side.

592
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:49,726
Okay.

593
00:45:54,676 --> 00:45:56,836
Love you. Take care. Okay.

594
00:45:56,905 --> 00:45:58,505
Bye.
- Bye.

595
00:46:10,794 --> 00:46:14,194
Brother.. there is a boy.

596
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,270
He studies in your college.
BSc. Final Year.

597
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:21,129
His name is Vivek Acharya,
Justice Acharya's son.

598
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:22,999
The two of you love each other.

599
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,790
How do you know that, Brother?

600
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,979
I am a policeman, not a milkman.

601
00:46:32,072 --> 00:46:33,752
I keep an eye on the entire city.

602
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:38,096
Won't I know whom my sister meets,
and where and when?

603
00:46:38,894 --> 00:46:40,534
Do you take me for a fool?

604
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,050
Do you love him?
- No.

605
00:46:46,205 --> 00:46:48,405
What?
- Yes.

606
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:51,191
Look at me.

607
00:46:52,796 --> 00:46:53,796
Good choice.

608
00:46:54,726 --> 00:46:55,966
Really, Brother?

609
00:46:56,334 --> 00:46:58,094
Yes. Yahoo!

610
00:46:58,874 --> 00:47:00,354
I'll talk to his father.

611
00:47:03,328 --> 00:47:07,008
It is a matter of pride
to make your sister..

612
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:09,586
..my daughter-in-law.

613
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:13,824
But..

614
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:17,645
..remember that we're
from the boy's side.

615
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,641
We have some conditions.

616
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:28,841
They'll get engaged tomorrow.

617
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,100
Tomorrow?

618
00:47:31,616 --> 00:47:34,176
But we need some time
for the arrangements.

619
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:36,191
No, nothing doing.

620
00:47:36,877 --> 00:47:39,437
The engagement should take
place tomorrow. It is an order.

621
00:47:39,647 --> 00:47:40,487
But sir..

622
00:47:40,656 --> 00:47:43,376
You're not in a hurry.
I'm in a hurry though.

623
00:47:43,683 --> 00:47:45,843
If your sister changes her mind..

624
00:47:45,922 --> 00:47:48,602
..my son won't get
such a good wife..

625
00:47:48,873 --> 00:47:53,313
..and I won't get such a good
daughter-in-law anywhere else.

626
00:47:53,374 --> 00:47:54,254
(Laughs)

627
00:47:56,896 --> 00:48:00,776
Therefore, the engagement ceremony
will be held here tomorrow.

628
00:48:00,976 --> 00:48:05,123
(Music)

629
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:20,479
"She is so beautiful,
she seems to be my heart"

630
00:48:31,572 --> 00:48:36,479
"She is so beautiful,
she seems to be my heart"

631
00:48:36,669 --> 00:48:40,189
"If she just opens her eyes
the heart sputters"

632
00:48:40,279 --> 00:48:43,279
"The lips say that she
seems to be my life!"

633
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,399
"She seems to be my life!"

634
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:56,999
"She is so beautiful,
she seems to be my heart"

635
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:01,368
"If she just opens her eyes
the heart sputters"

636
00:49:01,447 --> 00:49:03,919
"The lips say that she
seems to be my life!"

637
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,879
"She seems to be my life!"

638
00:49:07,439 --> 00:49:19,804
(Music)

639
00:49:43,005 --> 00:49:44,005
''The eyes.''

640
00:49:46,215 --> 00:49:47,978
''Your eyes.''

641
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:49,355
''Bindiya..''

642
00:49:51,356 --> 00:49:53,110
''Your bindiya..''

643
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:54,222
''Bangles.."

644
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:59,170
''lt decorates so well!'' ''Earrings!''

645
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:03,429
''Your earrings!''

646
00:50:04,153 --> 00:50:09,237
''Even the moon will shy away
looking at your face.'

647
00:50:09,449 --> 00:50:14,087
''The star''s hearts will break.''

648
00:50:14,384 --> 00:50:24,256
"She is so beautiful,
she seems to be my heart"

649
00:50:24,345 --> 00:50:28,600
"If she just opens her eyes
the heart sputters"

650
00:50:28,654 --> 00:50:29,852
"She seems to be my.."

651
00:50:31,209 --> 00:50:34,552
"The lips say that she
seems to be my life!"

652
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:11,242
"Dreams!"

653
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:15,042
"Your dreams"

654
00:51:15,202 --> 00:51:16,282
"Keep it"

655
00:51:18,372 --> 00:51:20,172
"Keep it well"

656
00:51:20,223 --> 00:51:21,463
"O dear!"

657
00:51:23,516 --> 00:51:26,396
"Your beloved looks so cute!"

658
00:51:27,975 --> 00:51:30,255
"Your beloved looks so cute!"

659
00:51:30,876 --> 00:51:36,210
"You got the procession,
I will go in the procession"

660
00:51:36,322 --> 00:51:41,324
"I will go from the house
but not from the heart"

661
00:51:41,415 --> 00:51:50,575
"She is so beautiful,
she seems to be my heart"

662
00:51:51,282 --> 00:51:54,882
"If she just opens her
eyes the heart sputters"

663
00:51:54,962 --> 00:51:58,002
"The lips say that she
seems to be my life!"

664
00:51:58,277 --> 00:52:00,877
"She seems to be my life!"

665
00:52:01,522 --> 00:52:06,522
"He is so handsome"

666
00:52:11,851 --> 00:52:16,891
"He is so handsome, he
seems to be my heart"

667
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:20,211
"If he just opens his
eyes the heart sputters"

668

"If he just opens his
eyes the heart sputters"

671
00:52:30,749 --> 00:52:34,029
"The lips say that he
seems to be my life!"

672
00:52:34,108 --> 00:52:36,588
"He seems to be my life!"

673
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,175
"He seems to be my life!"

674
00:52:39,237 --> 00:52:41,957
"He seems to be my life!"

675
00:52:42,553 --> 00:52:48,374
(Music)

676
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:57,571
Sir, your informer no.
555 wants to meet you.

677
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:59,730
Send him in. - Right, sir.

678
00:53:05,514 --> 00:53:06,834
Salutations, sir.

679
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:09,211
Come in.

680
00:53:13,018 --> 00:53:14,298
Yes, tell me. What
news have you brought?

681
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:18,225
Sir, I have definite news.

682
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,760
Zafar Supari..

683
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:26,201
..he has given (clicks tongue)...
a contract to kill the commissioner.

684
00:53:29,903 --> 00:53:35,180
And Zafar Supari's main
hitman is Pappu Kalia.

685
00:53:35,781 --> 00:53:38,301
He has a master plan, sir.

686
00:53:40,997 --> 00:53:45,117
And to succeed in his
contract, he's going to meet..

687
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:49,580
..four to five shooters at the
'Can Can' nightclub tonight.

688
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,338
Okay, you can go.

689
00:53:54,785 --> 00:53:55,785
Goodbye sir.

690
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:09,540
(Music)

691
00:54:15,591 --> 00:54:20,031
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

692
00:54:20,893 --> 00:54:25,253
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

693
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:41,685
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

694
00:54:42,201 --> 00:54:47,121
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

695
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:52,139
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

696
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:57,583
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

697
00:54:58,263 --> 00:55:02,103
"The beauty is wearing
a blouse of flames"

698
00:55:08,859 --> 00:55:12,139
"And yet love has
not aroused yet"

699
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:19,379
"You have robbed me, my beloved"

700
00:55:19,459 --> 00:55:21,899
"I've drowned in
the sea of love"

701
00:55:22,121 --> 00:55:24,561
"I won't regret even if I die"

702
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:27,219
"I'll be reborn just for you"

703
00:55:27,299 --> 00:55:30,019
"My heart is restless,
it only wishes for you"

704
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:32,219
"I don't know what may happen"

705
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:37,619
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

706
00:55:37,979 --> 00:55:42,419
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

707
00:55:42,962 --> 00:55:46,882
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

708
00:55:48,739 --> 00:55:54,259
(Music)

709
00:56:14,072 --> 00:56:15,792
"My heart burns and
its smoke rises"

710
00:56:15,863 --> 00:56:17,623
"When will you know
that, my love?"

711
00:56:17,695 --> 00:56:19,575
"If the pain rises
or I loose my sense"

712
00:56:19,646 --> 00:56:21,406
"Even then I gave my
heart only to you"

713
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:23,157
"I consumed the poison,
I swallowed the pain"

714
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:25,086
"Even then I didn't
take your name"

715
00:56:25,157 --> 00:56:28,710
"I have decided that I'll do
what I have never done yet"

716
00:56:28,869 --> 00:56:34,788
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

717
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:37,899
"I consumed the poison,
I swallowed the pain"

718
00:56:37,988 --> 00:56:39,748
"Even then I didn't
take your name"

719
00:56:39,828 --> 00:56:48,708
"I have decided that I'll do
what I have never done yet"

720
00:56:51,234 --> 00:56:54,874
"My life belongs to my love,
but my love is not aware of it"

721
00:56:54,969 --> 00:56:58,489
"I don't know what may happen"

722
00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:05,939
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

723
00:57:06,188 --> 00:57:11,108
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

724
00:57:11,499 --> 00:57:16,339
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

725
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:23,419
(Music)

726
00:57:42,663 --> 00:57:46,263
"I have no other wish
in my heart except you"

727
00:57:46,352 --> 00:57:49,712
"Your lover is yearning while
you have fun and frolic"

728
00:57:50,076 --> 00:57:53,756
"You are the God of my love
and I'm thirsty for your love"

729
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:57,379
"I see the divine in your eyes"

730
00:58:04,779 --> 00:58:08,459
"You are the God of my love
and I'm thirsty for your love"

731
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:18,019
"I see the divine in your eyes"

732
00:58:19,794 --> 00:58:23,394
"You are my pride,
you are my dignity"

733
00:58:23,498 --> 00:58:27,578
"I don't know what may happen"

734
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:35,074
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

735
00:58:35,154 --> 00:58:40,354
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

736
00:58:40,422 --> 00:58:45,102
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

737
00:58:45,742 --> 00:58:50,899
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

738
00:58:51,013 --> 00:58:56,293
"Oh darling! Oh darling!"

739
00:58:58,014 --> 00:58:58,894
Pappu Kalia.

740
00:59:05,271 --> 00:59:06,311
You're under arrest.

741
00:59:18,948 --> 00:59:20,348
(Gunshot)

742
00:59:25,247 --> 00:59:31,711
(Gunshot)

743
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,940
Arjun, drop your weapon!

744
00:59:53,018 --> 00:59:55,418
Or else I'll kill this girl.

745
00:59:56,783 --> 00:59:58,259
I'm telling you to
drop your weapon.

746
00:59:58,525 --> 01:00:00,405
Or else, this girl
will lose her life.

747
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:03,804
I'm telling you for the last time, Arjun.
Drop your weapon!

748
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:08,003
I'm telling you to
drop your weapon.

749
01:00:18,419 --> 01:00:19,459
Drop it!

750
01:00:23,129 --> 01:00:24,809
(Laughs)

751
01:00:25,552 --> 01:00:27,512
(Grunts)

752
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:28,898
(Gunshot)

753
01:00:51,472 --> 01:00:55,552
Kashi Trivedi! I made you
a minister from a milkman.

754
01:00:56,245 --> 01:00:58,245
I made you an MLA (Member
of Legislative Assembly)..

755
01:00:58,351 --> 01:00:59,591
..and a leader of
the opposition.

756
01:00:59,674 --> 01:01:02,434
For what? For this day?

757
01:01:02,529 --> 01:01:04,849
So you can give milk
sitting in the parliament?

758
01:01:06,836 --> 01:01:10,516
Hey, Kashi! Pappu Kalia is dead.

759
01:01:11,322 --> 01:01:14,714
One by one, all my lead
men have been killed..

760
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:16,460
..by that police
commissioner of yours.

761
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,219
My reign of 25
years over Mumbai..

762
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:21,759
..has been destroyed
by your Mumbai police.

763
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:26,994
And there, you have ruined
my name in front of the ISI.

764
01:01:28,979 --> 01:01:30,419
Do something, Minister.

765
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:33,499
Think of a solution to this.
Relieve us off this problem.

766
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,760
I have a solution
for this, Don Zafar.

767
01:01:38,076 --> 01:01:41,436
But it will cost
you a hefty price.

768
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:45,699
I was just wondering when you
would bark for more money.

769
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:48,450
Okay, then. Tell me how much.

770
01:01:48,765 --> 01:01:50,445
Then listen to me
carefully, Supari.

771
01:01:51,263 --> 01:01:53,743
The government of Chief
Minister Satyanarayan Joshi..

772
01:01:54,361 --> 01:01:57,961
..is supported by only
11 independent MLAs.

773
01:01:58,205 --> 01:02:02,365
And from those 11, nine
are ready to be bribed.

774
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:07,637
The cost is Rs. 600 millions.

775
01:02:07,714 --> 01:02:11,434
That means with Rs. 600 millions
you can become the Chief Minister.

776
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:15,739
Okay, Kashi. Overrule
the government.

777
01:02:16,237 --> 01:02:18,237
You'll get Rs.600
millions by tomorrow.

778
01:02:19,482 --> 01:02:20,922
Then consider yourself..

779
01:02:21,526 --> 01:02:24,646
..the prime minister
of Mumbai, Don Zafar.

780
01:02:25,169 --> 01:02:28,729
Everyone in the government
will consist of our people.

781
01:02:29,404 --> 01:02:32,804
The government will be ours
and the rule will be yours.

782
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:51,156
(Laughs)

783
01:02:54,452 --> 01:02:57,212
Hey, Munna! Hey, Badri!

784
01:02:57,456 --> 01:02:59,416
Didn't I tell you?

785
01:03:00,253 --> 01:03:02,453
I'll fix. I'll break.

786
01:03:02,729 --> 01:03:04,638
I'll fight and make
others fight too.

787
01:03:04,731 --> 01:03:06,583
I'll make the parties
and break them too.

788
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:10,668
But one day, I'll definitely
sit on this chair.

789
01:03:10,772 --> 01:03:12,092
(Laughs)

790
01:03:12,301 --> 01:03:14,621
That day has arrived, Munna.

791
01:03:14,974 --> 01:03:18,374
Now, I'm the king of this state.

792
01:03:18,883 --> 01:03:21,575
And the rest all are subjects.

793
01:03:21,729 --> 01:03:28,289
(Laughs)

794
01:03:29,304 --> 01:03:32,575
Listen, Brothers. All
you ministers, MLAs..

795
01:03:32,711 --> 01:03:36,751
..and officers. Honesty,
that is ho..nes..ty..

796
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:41,126
..is a thing of the past with your
past Chief Minister. Understood?

797
01:03:41,307 --> 01:03:44,318
Now, whatever I say will
be considered an order.

798
01:03:44,938 --> 01:03:47,258
Whatever I decide
will be the law.

799
01:03:51,881 --> 01:03:52,721
Sir..

800
01:03:54,788 --> 01:03:55,948
Tell me, Bhonsle..

801
01:03:57,188 --> 01:04:00,108
..have you brought my transfer orders
from the Home Minister's office?

802
01:04:01,955 --> 01:04:03,315
How did you know, sir?

803
01:04:04,455 --> 01:04:08,295
I knew.. as soon as the
new government is in rule..

804
01:04:08,984 --> 01:04:12,344
..the ministers have an old
habit of transferring officers.

805
01:04:14,235 --> 01:04:17,555
Bhonsle, explain
to these ministers.

806
01:04:19,174 --> 01:04:21,374
Only areas can be
changed by transfers..

807
01:04:22,755 --> 01:04:23,835
..not determination.

808
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:32,068
Tanaji, you take care of yourself
and keep writing letters to me.

809
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:54,720
So, you have also received
the news of my transfer.

810
01:04:58,912 --> 01:05:00,872
What's there to worry about?

811
01:05:01,551 --> 01:05:03,231
These sort of things do happen.

812
01:05:03,726 --> 01:05:07,286
But sir, people who changed
the government in 13 hours..

813
01:05:08,086 --> 01:05:10,006
..and transferred
you in three hours..

814
01:05:11,038 --> 01:05:14,161
..how can soldiers like
us who are only paid..

815
01:05:14,265 --> 01:05:17,185
..Rs.10000-12000
fight against them?

816
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:21,609
Avasthi, by putting a
price tag on this uniform..

817
01:05:22,383 --> 01:05:24,783
..don't insult all our
country's honest officers.

818
01:05:27,185 --> 01:05:32,544
Avasthi, terrorists fight for money.
But a soldier does not.

819
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:38,107
Soldiers only fight for the dignity
and safety of their country.

820
01:05:38,648 --> 01:05:39,408
Sorry, sir.

821
01:05:39,909 --> 01:05:44,469
Son, they can put
someone else in my place.

822
01:05:46,249 --> 01:05:48,209
But they can't change our
thoughts and our rights.

823
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:53,710
Sir, from now onwards, your
thoughts will be our duty.

824
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,360
The fire in your heart is now
burning within our hearts.

825
01:06:00,105 --> 01:06:04,145
Sir, the dream you had
of a crime-free state..

826
01:06:05,055 --> 01:06:06,615
..we'll fulfill that dream now.

827
01:06:07,816 --> 01:06:09,496
This will be our
gift to our mentor.

828
01:06:14,749 --> 01:06:19,789
I have spent Rs.600 millions to
break and make the government.

829
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,600
And for that, not just
60, not just 600..

830
01:06:25,179 --> 01:06:29,979
..but I'll torture 3600
million citizens of Mumbai..

831
01:06:30,064 --> 01:06:31,704
..to repay that amount.

832
01:06:32,481 --> 01:06:34,081
From builders to actors..

833
01:06:34,752 --> 01:06:38,272
..and from doctors to
producers, don't spare anyone.

834
01:06:39,651 --> 01:06:44,211
Tell them. If they want to live,
they need to pay protection money.

835
01:06:45,204 --> 01:06:47,204
If they want their
families to be safe..

836
01:06:48,029 --> 01:06:49,669
..then they should
send money to Zafar.

837
01:06:50,718 --> 01:06:52,758
If anyone wants to do
business in Mumbai..

838
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,979
..even if someone wants to
breathe freely in Mumbai..

839
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,860
..then send Don Zafar
his salutation money.

840
01:07:03,939 --> 01:07:05,259
Yeda!

841
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:11,830
The police thrashed my
men in their own homes.

842
01:07:12,893 --> 01:07:15,293
Threaten their homes too.

843
01:07:15,914 --> 01:07:19,514
Their mothers,
sisters, wife and kids.

844
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:22,989
If anyone disagrees,
chop them up.

845
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:27,539
Tell the police force to be
afraid of this father of theirs.

846
01:07:27,689 --> 01:07:30,369
Of Zafar Supari.

847
01:07:36,045 --> 01:07:36,885
(Brakes squeal)

848
01:07:37,369 --> 01:07:38,369
Bye.

849
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:41,359
You take care. - You too.

850
01:07:41,774 --> 01:07:42,934
Bye. - Bye.

851
01:07:51,502 --> 01:07:52,462
Mom.

852
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:56,007
Mom, where are you?

853
01:08:13,879 --> 01:08:15,599
(Laughs)

854
01:08:17,114 --> 01:08:18,474
(Screams)

855
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:22,052
Brother. Brother!

856
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,991
(Screams)

857
01:08:26,755 --> 01:08:30,235
Brother! Leave me.

858
01:08:32,452 --> 01:08:33,812
Leave me!

859
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:05,982
Don't worry.

860
01:09:06,347 --> 01:09:09,707
I'm not here to kill
you but to warn you.

861
01:09:12,036 --> 01:09:14,316
You know Zafar
Supari, don't you?

862
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,600
He lives out of country..

863
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,560
..but rules over all of Mumbai.

864
01:09:20,653 --> 01:09:24,973
Inspectors like your brother
fall at Zafar Supari's feet.

865
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,200
Explain to your brother..

866
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,270
..that he must respect
Zafar like a father..

867
01:09:31,507 --> 01:09:33,827
..and Yeda like
an elder brother.

868
01:09:34,387 --> 01:09:38,438
He must salute and
fear Zafar every day.

869
01:09:40,561 --> 01:09:43,001
Next time I won't come
here to explain anything.

870
01:09:44,192 --> 01:09:49,792
I'll chop your mother into
pieces and kidnap you, too.

871
01:09:53,847 --> 01:09:58,167
And anyway, a pretty girl
does not belong here..

872
01:09:58,901 --> 01:10:02,421
..but in Don Zafar's
harem and with me.

873
01:10:09,322 --> 01:10:10,202
(Brakes squeal)

874
01:10:34,457 --> 01:10:35,497
Who was here?

875
01:10:39,102 --> 01:10:39,781
Rakhi.

876
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,100
Who was here, Rakhi?

877
01:10:47,497 --> 01:10:50,257
Tell me. Please.

878
01:10:53,101 --> 01:10:55,381
Yes, tell me. - Yeda!

879
01:10:57,989 --> 01:10:59,469
One of Zafar Supari's men.

880
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:15,830
(Bullet clinks)

881
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:18,630
(Bullet clinks)

882
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:21,790
(Bullet clinks)

883
01:11:24,645 --> 01:11:29,405
So tell me, Chopra. How would
you like to have a bullet?

884
01:11:32,991 --> 01:11:34,351
With whiskey?

885
01:11:36,697 --> 01:11:37,897
With soda?

886
01:11:40,377 --> 01:11:41,457
With water?

887
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:45,115
No, Don. - Or..

888
01:11:46,874 --> 01:11:50,274
..direct!
- No, Don Yeda. Forgive me.

889
01:11:50,563 --> 01:11:51,683
Forgive you?

890
01:11:52,603 --> 01:11:56,803
Under that commissioner's approval,
you all were flying very high.

891
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:59,973
No, Don Yeda. I.. I.. I..

892
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:03,047
Come on. I want Rs.30
millions in cash..

893
01:12:03,345 --> 01:12:05,465
..the overseas rights
of your new film..

894
01:12:05,778 --> 01:12:08,818
..and the contract for
its home video and music.

895
01:12:11,765 --> 01:12:12,765
Come on, go.

896
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:15,130
I'll get it. I'll get
it right now, Don.

897
01:13:17,753 --> 01:13:20,193
What did you say?

898
01:13:20,849 --> 01:13:25,369
You'll chop our mothers into pieces?
Kidnap our sisters?

899
01:13:26,329 --> 01:13:27,569
No, Hyder.

900
01:13:34,737 --> 01:13:36,777
So, Zafar Supari's pimp.

901
01:13:37,604 --> 01:13:40,844
Come on. Now spread
your terror in the city.

902
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:45,090
Now threaten the police force.

903
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:46,899
No, Arjun.

904
01:13:47,738 --> 01:13:50,618
So Yeda, now tell me..

905
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:53,970
..how would you like
to have a bullet?

906
01:13:55,247 --> 01:13:56,727
With water?

907
01:13:57,945 --> 01:13:59,345
(Coughs and splutter)

908
01:14:00,106 --> 01:14:01,826
With soda?

909
01:14:02,522 --> 01:14:06,162
(Coughs and splutter)

910
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:08,550
With whiskey? Speak!

911
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,254
(Coughs and splutter)

912
01:14:10,451 --> 01:14:11,291
Or..

913
01:14:14,763 --> 01:14:17,163
No. - Direct?

914
01:14:17,937 --> 01:14:20,217
No.

915
01:14:21,117 --> 01:14:25,277
(Gunshot)

916
01:14:27,884 --> 01:14:29,084
(Phone rings)

917
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:31,359
(Phone rings)

918
01:14:32,328 --> 01:14:33,528
(Phone rings)

919
01:14:34,177 --> 01:14:36,577
Chote, it's Yeda's call.
- (Phone rings)

920
01:14:38,476 --> 01:14:42,716
Yes, Yeda. Tell me.
- Don, they've killed Yeda.

921
01:14:44,284 --> 01:14:45,204
What?

922
01:14:48,165 --> 01:14:49,485
(Over phone) What rubbish?

923
01:14:49,786 --> 01:14:54,986
It's not rubbish. It's
the truth, Zafar Supari.

924
01:14:56,483 --> 01:14:59,723
Who are you? - MPS..

925
01:15:01,204 --> 01:15:03,764
MPS? - Yes.

926
01:15:04,346 --> 01:15:07,706
Maharashtra Police Service.

927
01:15:09,997 --> 01:15:12,797
Zafar Supari, here's
a word of advice.

928
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:18,200
Don't send a band of eunuchs
to take on real men again.

929
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:24,540
Remember Zafar, for
goons like you..

930
01:15:25,125 --> 01:15:29,325
..there's no competition in
this world, but the police.

931
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:35,231
Zafar Supari, your
final warning.

932
01:15:36,263 --> 01:15:37,983
For you, there will
be no charge sheet..

933
01:15:38,688 --> 01:15:43,088
..only D-final, which
means only death final.

934
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:46,190
Jai Hind!

935
01:15:51,803 --> 01:15:52,683
Brother.

936
01:15:54,656 --> 01:15:55,456
Hey, Rakhi.

937
01:15:59,336 --> 01:16:00,776
Both of you at the
police station together?

938
01:16:01,544 --> 01:16:03,904
Tell me, who's here to
complain about whom?

939
01:16:04,566 --> 01:16:06,366
First of all, you write
down my complaint, sir.

940
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:09,728
This sister of yours keeps
threatening me all the time.

941
01:16:10,048 --> 01:16:11,608
If you don't do this,
I'll get you arrested.

942
01:16:12,045 --> 01:16:14,165
If you don't do that,
I'll get you handcuffed.

943
01:16:14,481 --> 01:16:15,481
She's doing nothing wrong.

944
01:16:15,576 --> 01:16:16,696
(Laughs)

945
01:16:17,129 --> 01:16:18,049
Look, Brother..

946
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:19,620
..the government is
granting him a scholarship..

947
01:16:19,725 --> 01:16:20,805
..for higher studies abroad..

948
01:16:21,087 --> 01:16:23,447
..and this gentleman
here refuses to leave.

949
01:16:23,737 --> 01:16:27,257
Brother, it's not even been three
weeks since our engagement..

950
01:16:27,352 --> 01:16:30,685
..and she wants to exile me
to Canada for three years.

951
01:16:31,406 --> 01:16:32,678
No, Brother. I don't want to go.

952
01:16:33,354 --> 01:16:35,303
If I were in your
place, I would've left..

953
01:16:35,441 --> 01:16:37,872
..the very next day after the engagement.
- Brother.

954
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:42,479
It's a lifetime opportunity.
Don't miss it.

955
01:16:42,753 --> 01:16:45,113
You've already got her.
Now don't leave that.

956
01:16:46,052 --> 01:16:48,012
And as far as your
fiancée is concerned..

957
01:16:49,002 --> 01:16:50,562
..I'm Arjun Ranawat.

958
01:16:51,215 --> 01:16:52,135
Don't worry.

959
01:16:53,061 --> 01:16:58,621
(Laughs) - (Phone rings)

960
01:16:59,635 --> 01:17:01,155
Hello. - (Over
phone) You traitor.

961
01:17:02,033 --> 01:17:04,473
(Over phone) Under your reign,
that inspector, Arjun Ranawat..

962
01:17:04,916 --> 01:17:09,116
(Over phone) ..tortured Yeda
and my men to death, like dogs..

963
01:17:09,495 --> 01:17:12,935
(Over phone) ..while you're
laying eggs on your CM's chair.

964
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:15,689
(Over phone) Warming
the seat, is that all?

965
01:17:15,921 --> 01:17:18,161
No, Don. The thing is..
- Don't interrupt me.

966
01:17:19,755 --> 01:17:23,155
If you don't take care
of those policemen soon..

967
01:17:24,555 --> 01:17:27,835
..then I'll take care
of your entire family.

968
01:17:28,586 --> 01:17:29,666
But Don, I was..

969
01:17:29,746 --> 01:17:30,986
You wretch.

970
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:35,812
If I can make a government
with Rs.600 millions..

971
01:17:37,078 --> 01:17:40,198
..I can even blow your head
off with a bullet worth Rs.60..

972
01:17:41,345 --> 01:17:47,185
..and wipe out you and
your entire family.

973
01:17:51,962 --> 01:17:54,802
What's the matter, Mr. Kashi?
Who was it?

974
01:17:55,777 --> 01:17:59,097
It was my boss.

975
01:17:59,906 --> 01:18:01,226
Zafar Supari.

976
01:18:02,026 --> 01:18:04,146
You idiot, Yashwant Deshpande..

977
01:18:04,741 --> 01:18:06,101
..I brought you all
the way from Pune..

978
01:18:06,165 --> 01:18:08,645
..and made you the
police commissioner here.

979
01:18:08,732 --> 01:18:12,507
For what? To dance in
your father's procession?

980
01:18:12,594 --> 01:18:14,354
You didn't do me a favor.

981
01:18:14,927 --> 01:18:17,598
I paid you Rs.25 millions for the post
of the Police Commissioner of Mumbai.

982
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:20,540
There. Did you hear
that, Kulkarni?

983
01:18:20,823 --> 01:18:23,183
He's crying for his
25 millions rupees.

984
01:18:23,443 --> 01:18:25,283
Explain to your father.

985
01:18:25,357 --> 01:18:28,717
Those encounter specialists
killed Zafar's men.

986
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:31,037
Were you sleeping?

987
01:18:31,677 --> 01:18:34,357
Now go and dismiss
this Encounter Squad.

988
01:18:34,434 --> 01:18:37,958
I don't want to see this Encounter
Squad again. Do you understand?

989
01:18:38,287 --> 01:18:40,207
That's not in my
power, Mr. Kashi.

990
01:18:40,304 --> 01:18:42,344
Then what's in your power?

991
01:18:42,798 --> 01:18:44,398
The sage's bell?

992
01:18:45,232 --> 01:18:47,832
Am I the Home Minister
of this country?

993
01:18:49,941 --> 01:18:51,661
I told you that it's
not in my power.

994
01:18:52,078 --> 01:18:54,362
Even the DG(Director General) and the
Central Home Ministry are involved in this.

995
01:18:55,489 --> 01:18:57,129
We'll gain nothing
out of anxiety.

996
01:18:57,488 --> 01:19:00,288
Whatever we do, we must
be careful with it.

997
01:19:00,411 --> 01:19:03,923
Mr. Kashi, first decide what
to do with Arjun Ranawat..

998
01:19:04,732 --> 01:19:07,772
..and even before that, decide
what to do with Hyder Ali.

999
01:19:09,252 --> 01:19:13,572
Hyder is Arjun's eyes and ears.

1000
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,960
He handles his
entire spy network.

1001
01:19:17,945 --> 01:19:19,265
If you eliminate Hyder..

1002
01:19:19,609 --> 01:19:23,049
..you can be sure you've
broken Arjun's backbone.

1003
01:19:23,276 --> 01:19:24,356
You are right.

1004
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:27,710
Mr. Kashi, I'll
take care of Hyder.

1005
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:30,911
I'll make an issue
of his religion..

1006
01:19:31,401 --> 01:19:33,481
..and try for his transfer.

1007
01:19:33,783 --> 01:19:35,463
I don't want mere effort.

1008
01:19:36,321 --> 01:19:40,641
Make sure he's transferred
and make it quick.

1009
01:19:41,178 --> 01:19:47,058
(Music)

1010
01:20:26,841 --> 01:20:27,921
Thank you.

1011
01:20:30,943 --> 01:20:31,863
Mr. Arjun.

1012
01:20:33,471 --> 01:20:35,631
Wait a minute. - Yes.

1013
01:20:37,709 --> 01:20:39,749
I know that you are the
strong and silent sort..

1014
01:20:40,484 --> 01:20:43,164
..who don't express
their feelings.

1015
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,520
But what will you
do with your eyes?

1016
01:20:48,068 --> 01:20:49,268
What are you saying?

1017
01:20:49,834 --> 01:20:53,794
I mean to say that I
can clearly make out..

1018
01:20:54,135 --> 01:20:57,375
..from your eyes that
you love me a lot.

1019
01:20:57,779 --> 01:20:58,699
Anything else?

1020
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,940
Okay, then tell me.
Should the ring be worn..

1021
01:21:03,115 --> 01:21:06,155
..on the finger or
around the neck?

1022
01:21:06,959 --> 01:21:08,359
On the nose.

1023
01:21:09,214 --> 01:21:11,374
Stop joking. Please tell me.

1024
01:21:12,216 --> 01:21:13,056
On the finger.

1025
01:21:14,155 --> 01:21:18,555
Then hold my hand and put
this ring on my finger..

1026
01:21:19,514 --> 01:21:21,514
..and make me your companion.

1027
01:21:21,865 --> 01:21:24,265
Companion? - Yes.

1028
01:21:24,544 --> 01:21:27,144
First don't make me suffer so much.
- What?

1029
01:21:27,524 --> 01:21:31,164
I'll put the ring on later,
but first put this on.

1030
01:21:37,336 --> 01:21:41,416
Jannat, beauty is adored
when it's covered up.

1031
01:21:59,841 --> 01:22:04,641
(Music)

1032
01:22:13,241 --> 01:22:18,441
"The heart which falls in love"

1033
01:22:21,321 --> 01:22:26,778
"That heart becomes
a non believer"

1034
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:33,762
"Then may God be angry with
you or the world leaves you"

1035
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:41,760
"Or even if the
life deserts you"

1036
01:22:44,697 --> 01:22:46,257
"In the spirit of love"

1037
01:23:02,721 --> 01:23:04,881
"When the magic of
love takes over"

1038

love in my heart"

"In the spirit of love"

1075
01:26:30,039 --> 01:26:32,439
Hyder Ali, here are
your transfer orders.

1076
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:35,961
You are being transferred from
the job because of your caste.

1077
01:26:36,456 --> 01:26:39,496
Hand over your charge
to ACP Arjun Ranawat.

1078
01:26:39,635 --> 01:26:40,635
But why, sir?

1079
01:26:40,968 --> 01:26:42,848
The special investigation
team is on..

1080
01:26:43,142 --> 01:26:45,542
..an operation to investigate
the Mumbai underworld's links..

1081
01:26:45,637 --> 01:26:47,797
..with the ISI and are exposing
some of the ISI agents here.

1082
01:26:49,138 --> 01:26:50,338
It is their opinion that..

1083
01:26:51,001 --> 01:26:53,521
..in this operation,
some of our officers..

1084
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:57,480
..may be gentle to the
alleged ISI agents.

1085
01:26:57,579 --> 01:26:59,779
Why don't you say
it clearly, sir?

1086
01:27:00,259 --> 01:27:02,459
That I'm being transferred..

1087
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:04,165
..because I'm a Muslim..

1088
01:27:04,699 --> 01:27:07,699
..and hence could be helping
the Muslim criminals?

1089
01:27:18,114 --> 01:27:21,194
Look at this. Can you
see these bullet marks?

1090
01:27:21,602 --> 01:27:24,562
These are marks from bullets
fired by Muslim terrorists.

1091
01:27:24,977 --> 01:27:27,137
The bullets coming
out of my gun..

1092
01:27:27,558 --> 01:27:30,758
..don't ask a criminal
his caste or religion.

1093
01:27:31,043 --> 01:27:33,363
Whether he is a
Hindu or a Muslim.

1094
01:27:35,346 --> 01:27:37,586
Through this report,
you want to convey..

1095
01:27:37,804 --> 01:27:39,884
..that my caste, my
religion is a proof..

1096
01:27:40,102 --> 01:27:42,342
..of me being a traitor.
- Hyder.

1097
01:27:42,413 --> 01:27:43,333
No, Arjun.

1098
01:27:44,307 --> 01:27:47,187
Even if I cut off my head
and give it to them..

1099
01:27:47,632 --> 01:27:49,032
..even then this department..

1100
01:27:49,601 --> 01:27:52,641
..would not believe that
Hyder is an honest..

1101
01:27:53,276 --> 01:27:54,916
..and patriotic police officer.

1102
01:27:56,493 --> 01:28:00,933
No, I don't care. - No.

1103
01:28:01,608 --> 01:28:04,328
Hyder don't do it.
Ali don't do it.

1104
01:28:06,288 --> 01:28:08,128
I don't want to do
this job, Arjun.

1105
01:28:27,489 --> 01:28:30,609
Commissioner, Hyder
Ali is such a Muslim..

1106
01:28:31,301 --> 01:28:33,221
..who can sacrifice his
life for his country..

1107
01:28:33,446 --> 01:28:36,921
..and his land even
without this uniform.

1108
01:28:47,809 --> 01:28:49,689
This is a mistake
on your part, sir.

1109
01:28:51,155 --> 01:28:53,035
The traitors have no
caste or religion.

1110
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,893
They are neither
Hindu nor Muslim.

1111
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:59,825
The mere fact that I'm a Rajput,
or that you're a Brahmin..

1112
01:29:00,670 --> 01:29:03,110
..is not proof of
us being patriots.

1113
01:29:05,575 --> 01:29:11,295
Such a cheap criminal thought takes
several youths like Hyder Ali..

1114
01:29:11,689 --> 01:29:14,569
..to wrong directions,
distancing them from our country.

1115
01:29:14,878 --> 01:29:17,558
Why don't you understand? These
decisions are not taken here.

1116
01:29:17,809 --> 01:29:19,369
They are taken in the offices
of the Home Ministry and..

1117
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:20,852
..DGP (Director
General of Police).

1118
01:29:21,114 --> 01:29:22,014
If you have the guts..

1119
01:29:22,246 --> 01:29:24,446
..go there and tell them
what you just told me.

1120
01:29:35,847 --> 01:29:37,685
(Brakes squeal)

1121
01:29:51,399 --> 01:29:52,439
Shut up.

1122
01:29:52,751 --> 01:29:55,671
You mean that he, who
took his belt off..

1123
01:29:56,262 --> 01:29:58,622
..and walked out abusing the police
department in front of a commissioner..

1124
01:29:58,728 --> 01:30:01,008
..that ill-mannered junior
of yours is correct?

1125
01:30:01,573 --> 01:30:04,453
That we are all non-secular?
Communal?

1126
01:30:04,635 --> 01:30:06,795
Is that what you want to say?

1127
01:30:07,289 --> 01:30:10,969
If your seniors call you and
tell you that you are a Sikh..

1128
01:30:11,271 --> 01:30:13,191
..and that you'd be aiding
the Khalistani terrorists..

1129
01:30:13,684 --> 01:30:15,764
..and are therefore being
transferred from Punjab..

1130
01:30:16,222 --> 01:30:17,742
..then you'd have
not liked it either.

1131
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:23,221
Sir, if you were not stopped
from fighting Sikh terrorists..

1132
01:30:23,825 --> 01:30:26,985
..why is Hyder Ali Khan
being stopped from fighting..

1133
01:30:27,059 --> 01:30:29,299
..Muslim terrorists
and ISI agents?

1134
01:30:31,344 --> 01:30:33,144
Without any proof or witness..

1135
01:30:33,425 --> 01:30:35,585
..just on the
grounds of religion..

1136
01:30:35,676 --> 01:30:38,396
..to suspect somebody
is unconstitutional.

1137
01:30:40,724 --> 01:30:41,804
Sir..

1138
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:46,039
..our constitution gives prominence
to duty. Best man for the job.

1139
01:30:46,682 --> 01:30:47,882
It does not give
prominence to religion.

1140
01:30:49,802 --> 01:30:50,722
Sir..

1141
01:30:51,367 --> 01:30:53,127
..Hyder Ali Khan
is such a soldier..

1142
01:30:53,795 --> 01:30:56,155
..who would like his uniform
to be adorned a million times..

1143
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:58,384
..but would never let it
be tarnished even once.

1144
01:31:09,744 --> 01:31:12,104
They have proven me a traitor.

1145
01:31:12,833 --> 01:31:16,313
Now, they'll knock me off
in an encounter any day.

1146
01:31:21,203 --> 01:31:24,123
What is this? My arrest warrant?

1147
01:31:24,508 --> 01:31:26,868
Or is it a search warrant
against a traitor?

1148
01:31:27,386 --> 01:31:30,586
No. These are orders
to have two more pegs.

1149
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:35,092
But have it with joy.
- What do you mean?

1150
01:31:35,983 --> 01:31:37,143
Read it and you'll know.

1151
01:31:43,233 --> 01:31:44,913
Your transfer order
has been cancelled.

1152
01:31:49,991 --> 01:31:52,191
You did this for me?

1153
01:31:52,855 --> 01:31:54,855
No, for myself.

1154
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:01,380
Because the police department
needs officers like you..

1155
01:32:02,105 --> 01:32:07,305
..and I need a friend like you.
- Is that so?

1156
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:09,622
Then you must also
do something for me.

1157
01:32:10,132 --> 01:32:12,252
Just ask. - Then listen.

1158
01:32:12,513 --> 01:32:14,393
A daughter-in-law like
Jannat for mother..

1159
01:32:14,587 --> 01:32:16,867
..a sister-in-law like
Jannat for me and Rakhi..

1160
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:20,640
..and Jannat as your
wife is what we all need.

1161
01:32:24,001 --> 01:32:26,681
Cheers. - Cheers.

1162
01:32:36,421 --> 01:32:42,501
(Music)

1163
01:32:58,186 --> 01:33:04,266
"I'll hide you in my
eyes in such a way"

1164
01:33:09,266 --> 01:33:14,826
"I'll hide you in my
eyes in such a way"

1165

"However you try to escape,
I'll steal you away"

"In your love my dear"

1167
01:33:31,444 --> 01:33:36,724
"In your love my dear,
I'll forget the world"

1168

my forehead tells it"

"The bangles on
my hands tell it"

1172
01:34:13,497 --> 01:34:19,337
"The anklets on my feet tell it.
Listen to it my dearest"

1173
01:34:19,409 --> 01:34:21,889
"Listen to it my dearest"

1174
01:34:27,293 --> 01:34:30,333
"I'll adorn you
forehead with stars.."

1175
01:34:30,448 --> 01:34:32,888
"..I'll fill your
heart with happiness"

1176

Listen to it my dearest"

"I've found out my life"

1179
01:34:46,248 --> 01:34:50,568
"I've found my happiness"

1180
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:56,132
"I've found my love"

1181
01:34:57,461 --> 01:35:00,501
"I'll make heart.."

..on the day of
celebration of our Goddess.

1190
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:15,190
My fortunes have opened up.
May you live long.

1191
01:36:22,303 --> 01:36:23,873
Dear, this is a special gift.

1192
01:36:24,023 --> 01:36:26,139
Rakhi had it made, so as to
give it to her sister-in-law..

1193
01:36:26,236 --> 01:36:28,759
..when she first
enters this house.

1194
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:32,496
Hold this, dear.

1195
01:36:43,988 --> 01:36:45,150
May you live long, dear.

1196
01:36:48,806 --> 01:36:52,446
May your hands always be around
to protect and bless me, Mother.

1197
01:36:52,718 --> 01:36:56,916
Hold this, Mother. Let me show
you the house, Sister-in-law.

1198
01:36:57,021 --> 01:36:58,341
Go along, dear.

1199
01:37:03,677 --> 01:37:07,397
She is good. You sit down.
I'll arrange for some food.

1200
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:12,410
(Laughs)

1201
01:37:12,661 --> 01:37:13,981
Hey, Deshpande..

1202
01:37:14,357 --> 01:37:18,117
..you're as nervous as a 16
year old on his first date.

1203
01:37:18,794 --> 01:37:23,274
Listen, I'm the
Deputy Chief Minister.

1204
01:37:23,919 --> 01:37:25,599
And when the elder
brother is the CM..

1205
01:37:25,912 --> 01:37:30,192
..what damage can the report..

1206
01:37:30,423 --> 01:37:33,583
..being prepared by ACP
Arjun Ranawat do to us?

1207
01:37:33,937 --> 01:37:37,417
Don't you read the newspapers?
If not, start reading them.

1208
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:41,820
Because of the leak in
the Jaiswal report..

1209
01:37:41,962 --> 01:37:44,202
..a DGP, a commissioner and..

1210
01:37:44,483 --> 01:37:46,963
..a dozen officers are
rotting in custody.

1211
01:37:47,322 --> 01:37:49,562
Their bells have been
rung, understood?

1212
01:37:51,705 --> 01:37:52,936
Listen, Mr. Kashi.

1213
01:37:53,466 --> 01:37:58,226
Arjun is digging into our
nexus with the underworld.

1214
01:37:58,696 --> 01:38:01,336
If he succeeds in
establishing that nexus..

1215
01:38:01,825 --> 01:38:05,985
..it would dig a grave
for us and the underworld.

1216
01:38:08,284 --> 01:38:11,114
Try and get that report
at any cost, Mr. Kashi.

1217
01:38:11,848 --> 01:38:13,772
If that report goes to Delhi..

1218
01:38:14,001 --> 01:38:16,161
..all of us will be behind bars.

1219
01:38:16,475 --> 01:38:17,675
And if.. - (Shushing)

1220
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:21,080
Badri. - Yes!

1221
01:38:21,207 --> 01:38:24,287
Those forged documents that are
being printed in our press..

1222
01:38:24,888 --> 01:38:27,168
..should be given to me tomorrow.
- Yes, Brother.

1223
01:38:29,042 --> 01:38:30,202
And yes..

1224
01:38:31,444 --> 01:38:34,764
..regarding that report
by Arjun Ranawat..

1225
01:38:36,204 --> 01:38:37,181
..that report will
be on the table of..

1226
01:38:38,823 --> 01:38:42,663
..Chief Minister Kashinath
Trivedi tomorrow morning.

1227
01:39:13,415 --> 01:39:16,055
(Laughs)

1228
01:39:16,575 --> 01:39:19,175
Did you remember something,
ACP Arjun Ranawat?

1229
01:39:20,976 --> 01:39:26,536
I told you that one day,
I'll occupy this chair.

1230
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:28,140
(Laughs)

1231
01:39:28,597 --> 01:39:31,157
And that you'll salute me.

1232
01:39:33,242 --> 01:39:34,202
Do you remember?

1233
01:39:35,868 --> 01:39:37,668
You're mistaken, Kashi Trivedi.

1234
01:39:38,699 --> 01:39:41,939
I've saluted this
constitutional position..

1235
01:39:42,705 --> 01:39:43,344
..and not you.

1236
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:50,330
Those who sit on this chair
keep coming and going.

1237
01:39:51,653 --> 01:39:53,173
Stay within your limit.

1238
01:39:53,839 --> 01:39:56,959
From today, I'm your master
and you're my servant.

1239
01:39:57,854 --> 01:40:01,289
I'm a public servant
and not yours.

1240
01:40:03,524 --> 01:40:04,804
I'm a public servant.

1241
01:40:06,110 --> 01:40:07,230
And so are you.

1242
01:40:09,324 --> 01:40:11,924
Tell me. What did
you call me for?

1243
01:40:12,833 --> 01:40:13,704
Then listen.

1244
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:18,080
I've kept the home
ministry with myself.

1245
01:40:18,448 --> 01:40:20,568
That's why I gave this order.

1246
01:40:20,970 --> 01:40:26,290
The data bank on the Mumbai
mafia that you have compiled..

1247
01:40:26,995 --> 01:40:27,893
..give it to me.

1248
01:40:28,433 --> 01:40:29,172
I knew it..

1249
01:40:30,246 --> 01:40:32,886
..that you'd want the
information on those..

1250
01:40:33,534 --> 01:40:35,694
..who helped you reach here.

1251
01:40:38,182 --> 01:40:40,502
Take it. Keep it safe.

1252
01:40:40,606 --> 01:40:42,815
(Laughs)

1253
01:40:43,347 --> 01:40:45,507
Confidential..

1254
01:40:46,032 --> 01:40:47,832
(Laughs)

1255
01:40:48,485 --> 01:40:50,085
So, this is the real deal.

1256
01:40:50,872 --> 01:40:53,192
You must have worked very
hard to compile this.

1257
01:40:53,342 --> 01:40:54,422
But..

1258
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:05,010
(Laughs)

1259
01:41:18,007 --> 01:41:23,767
Saw how I burnt it
to ashes in a moment?

1260
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:30,079
You must be feeling
heartbroken, right?

1261
01:41:30,599 --> 01:41:34,279
No. Yours will hurt.

1262
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:36,740
Maybe, you'll even
have a heart attack.

1263
01:41:37,399 --> 01:41:39,159
Because one copy of
this has been sent..

1264
01:41:39,368 --> 01:41:41,088
..to the Central Home Ministry..

1265
01:41:42,683 --> 01:41:45,363
..the second to the
President's office..

1266
01:41:47,175 --> 01:41:51,695
..and the third to the
Prime Minister's office.

1267
01:41:53,758 --> 01:41:55,718
Your mafia friends
can't escape now.

1268
01:41:56,949 --> 01:41:58,589
You're a scalper
for Zafar Supari.

1269
01:42:01,366 --> 01:42:04,526
What did you say? You
called me a scalper?

1270
01:42:05,472 --> 01:42:06,432
Me.

1271
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:09,670
You called Kashi a scalper?

1272
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:11,718
You called the CM a scalper?

1273
01:42:12,185 --> 01:42:15,305
You small-time police
officer, what's your status?

1274
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,360
What do you think you are?

1275
01:42:19,221 --> 01:42:23,221
Kashi Trivedi, when the
bones break at this age..

1276
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:25,810
..they're set back
with great difficulty.

1277
01:42:27,775 --> 01:42:28,895
Take your hands off me.

1278
01:42:31,929 --> 01:42:33,929
Now I'll show you your status.

1279
01:43:02,267 --> 01:43:07,067
You beat up the CM!
You beat the CM!

1280
01:43:09,436 --> 01:43:14,916
No, a patriotic and
honest public servant..

1281
01:43:15,529 --> 01:43:18,959
..has beaten up a treacherous
and dishonest public servant.

1282
01:43:22,263 --> 01:43:25,783
Kashi Trivedi, my
name is Arjun Ranawat.

1283
01:43:26,757 --> 01:43:30,791
To me, death is like a pillow
and a coffin is like a bed.

1284
01:43:37,537 --> 01:43:38,457
Jai Hind!

1285
01:43:48,075 --> 01:43:49,315
Yes, 555. What is the news?

1286
01:43:49,564 --> 01:43:51,124
Who? Arjun sir?

1287
01:43:51,384 --> 01:43:54,944
No, I'm Hyder speaking. Tell me.

1288
01:43:55,022 --> 01:43:58,022
Sir, the minor girls brought
in for prostitution..

1289
01:43:58,104 --> 01:44:01,504
..from different
parts of the country..

1290
01:44:01,608 --> 01:44:05,048
..have been hidden in the
old Jassai railway yard.

1291
01:44:06,324 --> 01:44:10,306
And they'll be sent to different
brothels in Mumbai tonight.

1292
01:44:12,089 --> 01:44:14,329
Please save them, sir.

1293
01:44:14,832 --> 01:44:17,872
Don't worry. We'll go
there and save them all.

1294
01:44:25,339 --> 01:44:28,341
Please don't kill me, sir.
Leave me.

1295
01:44:28,889 --> 01:44:29,769
(Gunshot)

1296
01:44:35,569 --> 01:44:37,300
(Brakes squeal)

1297
01:44:48,049 --> 01:44:50,849
(Gun cocks)

1298
01:45:02,578 --> 01:45:03,778
There's nobody here.

1299
01:45:03,938 --> 01:45:05,898
Was the news given by 555 false?

1300
01:45:06,248 --> 01:45:08,658
Sir, could this be a trap?
- Yes.

1301
01:45:09,204 --> 01:45:10,444
This is a trap.

1302
01:45:14,402 --> 01:45:16,162
A trap for all of you to die.

1303
01:45:17,044 --> 01:45:19,044
Zafar Supari, you?

1304
01:45:19,392 --> 01:45:23,992
Yes, it's me. I'm in India.

1305
01:45:25,835 --> 01:45:26,995
Look around you.

1306
01:45:36,645 --> 01:45:40,605
Encounter Specialist, I'll
do the encounters today.

1307
01:45:41,147 --> 01:45:44,445
Yours, your friend
Arjun Ranawat's..

1308
01:45:44,543 --> 01:45:46,503
..and of all of Mumbai.

1309
01:45:47,576 --> 01:45:52,336
See, I've brought
500 tonnes of RDX.

1310
01:45:52,771 --> 01:45:53,811
Turn around and see.

1311
01:46:00,612 --> 01:46:02,412
It's good that
you have brought..

1312
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:04,809
..your own funeral pyre
materials to burn yourself.

1313
01:46:05,170 --> 01:46:07,450
Instead of you burning
the city of Mumbai..

1314
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:13,120
..I, Hyder Ali
Khan, will burn you.

1315
01:46:14,099 --> 01:46:16,259
(Gunshot)

1316
01:46:16,349 --> 01:46:23,269
(Rapid gunfire)

1317
01:47:10,919 --> 01:47:13,919
We're trapped, sir. Five
of our colleagues are dead.

1318
01:47:14,422 --> 01:47:17,422
We have no option,
but to retreat.

1319
01:47:18,556 --> 01:47:21,116
This is not the time
to retreat, friends.

1320
01:47:21,946 --> 01:47:24,266
This is the time to pay back our
debt to this uniform we wear.

1321
01:47:25,188 --> 01:47:30,308
Today, all of us will
pay back that debt.

1322
01:47:33,388 --> 01:47:35,508
How much ammunition
are we left with?

1323
01:47:36,435 --> 01:47:37,635
Last magazine, sir.

1324
01:48:04,805 --> 01:48:06,215
Friends, our prime target
is destruction of..

1325
01:48:06,592 --> 01:48:08,973
..the RDX brought
by Zafar Supari.

1326
01:48:09,992 --> 01:48:12,072
I'm moving towards
that direction.

1327
01:48:12,788 --> 01:48:14,708
You both will cover me.

1328
01:48:14,768 --> 01:48:16,248
Any doubts? - No, sir.

1329
01:48:21,832 --> 01:48:25,632
(Gunshot)

1330
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:13,420
(Empty gun clicks)

1331
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,480
No!

1332
01:49:21,030 --> 01:49:22,710
Oh, God.

1333
01:49:28,763 --> 01:49:35,203
(Explosion)

1334
01:49:38,327 --> 01:49:39,245
Hyder!

1335
01:50:06,595 --> 01:50:11,972
Zafar Supari, you'd set out
to burn all of Mumbai, right?

1336
01:50:12,450 --> 01:50:15,810
Look. Hyder Ali Khan
will burn you up..

1337
01:50:15,985 --> 01:50:20,705
..in the same burning RDX
pile you brought here.

1338
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:24,440
(Gun cocks)

1339
01:50:28,126 --> 01:50:29,126
(Gunshot)

1340
01:50:37,334 --> 01:50:39,534
Avasthi? You?

1341
01:50:40,211 --> 01:50:42,491
Traitor! - Yes.

1342
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:50,200
Hyder Ali!

1343
01:50:55,393 --> 01:51:04,033
(Gunshot)

1344
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:05,160
(Empty gun clicks)

1345
01:51:21,268 --> 01:51:24,908
(Phone rings)

1346
01:51:25,504 --> 01:51:30,790
Hello.
- Yes, MPS. Maharashtra Police Services.

1347
01:51:32,597 --> 01:51:36,757
Go to old Jassai railway yard..

1348
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,180
..where the corpses of
your brother, Haider..

1349
01:51:39,557 --> 01:51:45,477
..and other colleagues of
yours are waiting for you.

1350
01:51:47,515 --> 01:51:48,155
(Cellphone beeps)

1351
01:52:05,012 --> 01:52:06,492
(Explosion)

1352
01:52:37,295 --> 01:52:38,095
Ashok.

1353
01:52:42,161 --> 01:52:43,001
Hyder.

1354
01:52:50,063 --> 01:52:50,983
Deepak.

1355
01:52:53,165 --> 01:52:54,325
Hyder.

1356
01:52:59,135 --> 01:53:00,255
Yashwant Rao.

1357
01:53:04,298 --> 01:53:07,178
Hyder.

1358
01:53:17,178 --> 01:53:20,056
Hyder.

1359
01:53:27,146 --> 01:53:28,346
Hyder.

1360
01:53:29,626 --> 01:53:34,546
"The uniform is our pride."

1361
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:40,018
"The uniform is our faith."

1362
01:53:43,004 --> 01:53:47,044
"The uniform is our identity."

1363
01:53:48,476 --> 01:53:50,996
"The uniform is our God."

1364
01:53:51,116 --> 01:53:52,516
Hyder.

1365
01:53:53,815 --> 01:53:58,255
"I've sacrificed this
life for my country."

1366
01:54:11,649 --> 01:54:19,329
"We are proud of our country"

1367
01:54:22,174 --> 01:54:25,494
I'm very sorry to
inform the press that..

1368
01:54:25,801 --> 01:54:30,681
..Hyder Ali Khan, the bravest
officer of the Crime Control Squad..

1369
01:54:32,030 --> 01:54:33,110
..was a secret agent operating..

1370
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:36,560
..for the underworld and
Pakistan Secret Service, ISI.

1371
01:54:43,962 --> 01:54:48,162
Pakistan and the
underworld together..

1372
01:54:48,659 --> 01:54:51,819
..had planned for another
serial bomb explosion in Mumbai.

1373
01:54:52,530 --> 01:54:56,170
Inspector Hyder Ali
was helping them..

1374
01:54:56,301 --> 01:54:59,181
..bring 500 tonnes
of RDX into Mumbai.

1375
01:55:07,762 --> 01:55:12,442
Yesterday, Inspector
Avasthi reached the spot..

1376
01:55:13,246 --> 01:55:16,051
..and destroyed the
dangerous mission.

1377
01:55:17,229 --> 01:55:21,429
Not only did Avasthi destroy
the RDX, but also killed..

1378
01:55:22,135 --> 01:55:28,375
..the traitor Hyder Ali
Khan and his accomplices.

1379
01:55:41,636 --> 01:55:43,836
During our raids at
Hyder Ali's residence..

1380
01:55:44,064 --> 01:55:49,104
..we found some floppies,
foreign bank accounts..

1381
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:53,490
..forged passports and visas..

1382
01:55:53,882 --> 01:55:56,682
..and some ISI identity cards.
- (Camera clicks)

1383
01:55:58,857 --> 01:56:03,497
These are proof of his having
been a Pakistani agent.

1384
01:56:09,372 --> 01:56:10,332
(Phone rings)

1385
01:56:11,865 --> 01:56:12,905
(Phone rings)

1386
01:56:31,749 --> 01:56:33,949
Zafar Supari.

1387
01:56:45,859 --> 01:56:47,139
'What am I doing?'

1388
01:56:48,886 --> 01:56:52,166
'I had vowed not to discuss
that incident with anybody.'

1389
01:56:53,850 --> 01:56:55,490
'But today, I've broken my vow.'

1390
01:56:58,189 --> 01:56:59,029
'No.'

1391
01:57:57,306 --> 01:57:59,866
Tyagi. What is this man saying?

1392
01:58:00,806 --> 01:58:03,046
Samar Singh has resigned
from his police job..

1393
01:58:03,263 --> 01:58:04,927
..and is going to
fight Ranawat's case?

1394
01:58:05,488 --> 01:58:07,328
He has filed a lawsuit in court.

1395
01:58:07,462 --> 01:58:10,342
(Chuckles) What is so
alarming in that, Mr. Kashi?

1396
01:58:11,189 --> 01:58:13,629
Everybody knows that Samar
Singh is also a lawyer.

1397
01:58:14,448 --> 01:58:16,888
But he is also an
emotional lawyer.

1398
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:19,630
But I am a professional lawyer..

1399
01:58:19,699 --> 01:58:23,419
..experienced in proving true
as false and false as true.

1400
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:25,480
Let it be. - But we should be..

1401
01:58:25,539 --> 01:58:29,819
Mr. Kashi. The false
evidence that we have and..

1402
01:58:30,197 --> 01:58:32,237
..the charge sheet I've prepared
is so strong and foolproof..

1403
01:58:33,032 --> 01:58:34,752
..that let alone Samar Singh..

1404
01:58:35,889 --> 01:58:43,330
..even God can't save Arjun
Ranawat from death penalty.

1405
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:46,170
The game is over.

1406
01:58:51,765 --> 01:58:55,565
Your Honor, I would like
to present the officers..

1407
01:58:56,228 --> 01:59:01,148
..who have been working with Arjun
Ranawat for the past 15 years.

1408
01:59:02,189 --> 01:59:05,069
These witnesses will tell us..

1409
01:59:05,957 --> 01:59:09,477
..who Arjun Ranawat is and
what his character is like..

1410
01:59:10,295 --> 01:59:11,615
..and what the truth is.

1411
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:13,437
Permission granted.

1412
01:59:15,523 --> 01:59:18,963
Your Honor, this is
that Arjun Ranawat..

1413
01:59:19,503 --> 01:59:21,441
..who is considered
the lion of Mumbai.

1414
01:59:22,124 --> 01:59:26,444
The mafia gangs would shiver in
their boots on hearing his name.

1415
01:59:26,596 --> 01:59:29,916
Sir, he's that Arjun
Ranawat because of whom..

1416
01:59:29,967 --> 01:59:32,092
..the underworld was
not only forced..

1417
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:33,850
..to leave the city,
but the country too.

1418
01:59:35,387 --> 01:59:36,304
Your Honor..

1419
01:59:36,810 --> 01:59:38,730
..if the police force..

1420
01:59:39,077 --> 01:59:41,597
..didn't have officers
like Arjun and Hyder Ali..

1421
01:59:41,961 --> 01:59:44,361
..then these mafias would have
made the police their pimps..

1422
01:59:44,788 --> 01:59:47,388
..and Mumbai their brothel.

1423
01:59:51,181 --> 01:59:53,581
But this is the misfortune
of this country..

1424
01:59:54,556 --> 01:59:59,396
..that one was killed by humiliation
while performing his duties..

1425
02:00:00,587 --> 02:00:02,187
..and the other..

1426
02:00:02,502 --> 02:00:04,102
..is standing in
this witness box.

1427
02:00:08,151 --> 02:00:10,151
I would like to call
Arjun Ranawat's mother..

1428
02:00:10,397 --> 02:00:14,402
..Shakuntla Devi
to the witness box.

1429
02:00:15,732 --> 02:00:16,692
Permission granted.

1430
02:00:19,559 --> 02:00:23,039
Mrs. Shakuntla
Devi, when court..

1431
02:00:23,232 --> 02:00:27,472
..will declare your son to be a
traitor and sentence him to death..

1432
02:00:28,504 --> 02:00:32,304
..won't you be ashamed
of being his mother?

1433
02:00:32,761 --> 02:00:33,854
Won't you regret it?

1434
02:00:37,372 --> 02:00:38,332
Regret?

1435
02:00:40,272 --> 02:00:45,110
I'll regret that
I didn't bear him.

1436
02:00:46,949 --> 02:00:50,469
I'll regret that every
mother of this country..

1437
02:00:51,190 --> 02:00:53,150
..didn't give birth
to a son like Arjun.

1438
02:00:54,448 --> 02:00:58,968
Not regret, but I'll be
proud of Arjun's death.

1439
02:00:59,905 --> 02:01:03,676
The same pride which 'Bhagat
Singh's' (Indian freedom fighter)..

1440
02:01:04,429 --> 02:01:06,709
..mother felt on the day of
Bhagat Singh's execution.

1441
02:01:06,755 --> 02:01:08,195
Every countryman
would have felt it.

1442
02:01:12,667 --> 02:01:15,907
Your Honor, not just in this
life, but in every life..

1443
02:01:16,934 --> 02:01:21,694
..I would like to live
and die as Arjun's mother.

1444
02:01:24,064 --> 02:01:25,344
(Clapping)

1445
02:01:25,447 --> 02:01:27,687
Wow! What a speech!

1446
02:01:27,890 --> 02:01:30,210
Astonishing! Incredible!

1447
02:01:30,892 --> 02:01:33,132
But I would like to
remind the court..

1448
02:01:33,218 --> 02:01:35,618
..that this case is
a mass murder case.

1449
02:01:36,116 --> 02:01:38,876
And the criminal has
already admitted his crime.

1450
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:43,120
And Your Honor, I also
want my friend to know..

1451
02:01:43,749 --> 02:01:47,149
..that cases are fought with
evidence and witnesses..

1452
02:01:47,564 --> 02:01:50,644
..not with speeches
and dramatics.

1453
02:01:51,293 --> 02:01:52,413
Also, Your Honor..

1454
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:59,000
..when his mother has already
compared him to Bhagat Singh..

1455
02:01:59,513 --> 02:02:02,593
..then to spare that
great martyr's name..

1456
02:02:03,409 --> 02:02:06,409
..I'm left with no other
choice, but to unveil a truth..

1457
02:02:06,778 --> 02:02:10,178
..after which every
mother and sister..

1458
02:02:10,361 --> 02:02:11,961
..of this world would
like to die in shame.

1459
02:02:12,761 --> 02:02:13,601
And this mother..

1460
02:02:14,049 --> 02:02:14,849
(Chuckles)

1461
02:02:15,356 --> 02:02:18,236
..she'll be left
utterly speechless.

1462
02:02:22,807 --> 02:02:25,219
Okay, Mrs. Shakuntla Devi.
Tell the court..

1463
02:02:25,317 --> 02:02:26,736
..on the night of
1st of November..

1464
02:02:26,827 --> 02:02:29,675
..where was your
daughter Rakhi Dixit?

1465
02:02:31,822 --> 02:02:33,222
Answer me, Shakuntla Devi.

1466
02:02:33,643 --> 02:02:36,723
Where was your daughter
and his so-called sister..

1467
02:02:37,147 --> 02:02:39,707
..on the night of
the mass murder?

1468
02:02:46,220 --> 02:02:48,900
Answer me. Where was she?

1469
02:02:52,741 --> 02:02:54,501
You tell me, Arjun Ranawat..

1470
02:02:55,537 --> 02:02:57,337
..on the night of
the 1st of November..

1471
02:02:57,844 --> 02:03:02,324
..where was your so-called
sister, Rakhi Dixit?

1472
02:03:06,175 --> 02:03:08,935
Answer me, Arjun Ranawat.
Why are you so quiet?

1473
02:03:12,287 --> 02:03:16,207
You can't answer this question
and nor can your mother.

1474
02:03:17,541 --> 02:03:20,261
I'll answer this question.

1475
02:03:25,299 --> 02:03:27,739
Your Honor, on the night
of the 1st of November..

1476
02:03:27,836 --> 02:03:29,697
..his sister, a girl
of loose character..

1477
02:03:29,767 --> 02:03:30,993
..an aimless and uncultured woman..
- I object, Your Honor.

1478
02:03:31,072 --> 02:03:32,478
..was at the chief
minister's farmhouse..

1479
02:03:32,557 --> 02:03:35,151
..making merry with the
Deputy CM, Munna Trivedi..

1480
02:03:35,226 --> 02:03:39,554
..police commissioner's son and
many other people, Your Honor.

1481
02:03:39,630 --> 02:03:40,998
I object, Your Honor.

1482
02:03:41,068 --> 02:03:43,537
She was a high society
call girl, Your Honor.

1483
02:03:43,634 --> 02:03:45,063
She didn't just have illegitimate
relations with many men..

1484
02:03:45,169 --> 02:03:50,332
..but also with her so-called
brother, Arjun Ranawat.

1485
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:55,262
She was his sister during the
day and his mistress at night.

1486
02:03:55,338 --> 02:03:57,618
His mistress.

1487
02:03:58,183 --> 02:03:59,463
Tyagi!

1488
02:04:18,646 --> 02:04:20,846
Arjun! Don't Arjun!

1489
02:04:23,744 --> 02:04:24,784
(Groans)

1490
02:04:29,876 --> 02:04:31,768
What's this? He's
started with hooliganism.

1491
02:04:31,834 --> 02:04:33,196
Somebody stop him.

1492
02:04:34,446 --> 02:04:38,046
Guards, security. Catch him.

1493
02:04:38,142 --> 02:04:40,622
Guards! Catch him. Hold him.

1494
02:04:47,644 --> 02:04:50,284
Arjun! No, son. No, son.

1495
02:04:50,827 --> 02:04:52,027
Arjun!

1496
02:04:52,090 --> 02:04:54,730
Arjun! I say, no. Leave him.

1497
02:04:54,816 --> 02:04:55,856
Swear by me.

1498
02:04:56,077 --> 02:05:00,277
(Groans)

1499
02:05:08,887 --> 02:05:12,967
(Coughs)

1500
02:05:13,247 --> 02:05:15,727
Did you see that, Your Honor?

1501
02:05:16,007 --> 02:05:19,727
He doesn't know of any other
way to stifle the truth.

1502
02:05:19,910 --> 02:05:22,167
He can't tolerate
any other man..

1503
02:05:22,273 --> 02:05:25,447
..in a relationship with Rakhi.

1504
02:05:25,527 --> 02:05:26,607
(Coughs)

1505
02:05:26,744 --> 02:05:29,727
On the night of 1st November..

1506
02:05:29,833 --> 02:05:33,337
..when he found his 'mistress-sister'
with not one, but three men in bed..

1507
02:05:33,449 --> 02:05:35,687
..he lost control
in just this way.

1508
02:05:35,784 --> 02:05:38,384
And that's why, he
committed that mass murder.

1509
02:05:38,687 --> 02:05:39,807
Tyagi!

1510
02:05:41,488 --> 02:05:45,168
(Gavel Bangs) Order! Order!
I say, stop it!

1511
02:05:48,230 --> 02:05:53,070
Samar Singh, one more inappropriate
action like this from your client..

1512
02:05:53,850 --> 02:05:56,890
..will force me to stop
this proceeding right here..

1513
02:05:57,655 --> 02:06:00,335
..and come to a conclusion.

1514
02:06:01,164 --> 02:06:02,164
Sorry, Your Honor.

1515
02:06:05,879 --> 02:06:08,338
Today's proceeding
is stopped here.

1516
02:06:09,237 --> 02:06:12,397
Tomorrow's proceeding will
be held in the presence..

1517
02:06:12,534 --> 02:06:15,654
..of paramilitary forces..

1518
02:06:16,427 --> 02:06:19,827
..and only the people who
are concerned with this case.

1519
02:06:27,716 --> 02:06:30,556
Shameless. Rotten scoundrel.

1520
02:06:31,715 --> 02:06:34,395
If I wasn't bound by the
boundaries of the law today..

1521
02:06:34,813 --> 02:06:36,653
..I would have shot that Tyagi.

1522
02:06:39,427 --> 02:06:41,787
By presenting Rakhi
in court tomorrow..

1523
02:06:42,447 --> 02:06:44,928
..I'll clear all the lies
Tyagi has been spewing.

1524
02:06:45,362 --> 02:06:48,522
But Rakhi cannot come to court.

1525
02:06:48,721 --> 02:06:51,161
Why? Why can't she come?

1526
02:06:51,922 --> 02:06:54,162
She'll have to come
to court tomorrow.

1527
02:06:54,711 --> 02:06:59,871
But sir, she is in deep shock
due to Arjun's killings.

1528
02:07:00,330 --> 02:07:03,810
Since she's got the news, she
just won't react to anyone.

1529
02:07:04,783 --> 02:07:08,423
She is being treated at the St.
Mary's sanitarium in Khandala.

1530
02:07:08,599 --> 02:07:12,399
'There is definitely some secret
that Arjun is hiding from me.'

1531
02:07:18,243 --> 02:07:19,883
Don't sit like a rock.

1532
02:07:20,455 --> 02:07:21,535
Tell me, Rakhi.

1533
02:07:22,857 --> 02:07:24,977
What was the reason behind
that mass slaughter?

1534
02:07:28,058 --> 02:07:32,058
One of your brothers, Hyder Ali,
has died a humiliating death.

1535
02:07:32,593 --> 02:07:35,393
And the other one is
charged with treason.

1536
02:07:35,749 --> 02:07:37,389
Will you be able to bear that..

1537
02:07:37,779 --> 02:07:40,059
..your brother Arjun
is sentenced to death?

1538
02:07:40,495 --> 02:07:41,695
No.

1539
02:07:42,394 --> 02:07:44,514
Will you able to live
after hearing that..

1540
02:07:45,084 --> 02:07:49,484
..your brother is a despicable
and disgraceful person?

1541
02:07:51,474 --> 02:07:52,994
You stone-hearted woman..

1542
02:07:53,510 --> 02:07:56,510
..will you be able to
bear people saying that..

1543
02:07:57,009 --> 02:08:00,129
..you had an indecent
relationship with your brother?

1544
02:08:02,896 --> 02:08:05,978
Will you be able to listen to the
taunt that you are Arjun's mistress?

1545
02:08:06,080 --> 02:08:07,920
No! (Screams)

1546
02:08:08,012 --> 02:08:10,212
(Thunder crashing)

1547
02:08:11,118 --> 02:08:13,638
Tell me clearly, dear,
what the truth is.

1548
02:08:14,141 --> 02:08:16,271
Perhaps, I'll be able
to save Arjun's life.

1549
02:08:19,556 --> 02:08:22,556
Tell me what the truth is.

1550
02:08:24,023 --> 02:08:25,623
I'll tell you, Uncle.

1551
02:08:26,911 --> 02:08:30,831
I'll tell you the truth.

1552
02:08:51,642 --> 02:08:56,282
(Crying)

1553
02:09:35,622 --> 02:09:38,742
Your Honor, these
are some documents..

1554
02:09:39,711 --> 02:09:41,511
..that I'm going
to give to the..

1555
02:09:41,809 --> 02:09:43,969
..Chief Minister and
Police Commissioner.

1556
02:09:44,302 --> 02:09:45,582
Please watch carefully.

1557
02:09:49,196 --> 02:09:53,676
So Chief Minister, what
do you have in your hand?

1558
02:09:54,899 --> 02:09:57,099
They are the pamphlets of
my election propaganda.

1559
02:09:58,784 --> 02:10:01,984
And this is my newspaper,
'Mera Bharat Mahan.'

1560
02:10:03,317 --> 02:10:06,557
Can you tell us where
they are printed?

1561
02:10:07,046 --> 02:10:10,446
At my own printing press in Nagpur.
- Good.

1562
02:10:11,771 --> 02:10:15,131
So, Police Commissioner. What
do you have in your hand?

1563
02:10:15,368 --> 02:10:18,577
This? They are the documents
from Pakistan which mention..

1564
02:10:18,672 --> 02:10:21,312
..that Hyder and Arjun
Ranawat are ISI agents.

1565
02:10:21,770 --> 02:10:23,370
Pakistan's government's
documents.

1566
02:10:25,142 --> 02:10:27,542
According to the reports
given by laboratory experts..

1567
02:10:28,182 --> 02:10:31,662
..the ink used in printing
these documents from Pakistan..

1568
02:10:32,527 --> 02:10:34,927
..is the same as the ink used
in Chief Minister's newspaper..

1569
02:10:35,137 --> 02:10:36,777
..'Mera Bharat Mahan.'

1570
02:10:41,128 --> 02:10:43,768
Now, there can only be
two things, Your Honor.

1571
02:10:45,132 --> 02:10:48,812
Either Chief Minister's
newspaper 'Mera Bharat Mahan'..

1572
02:10:49,238 --> 02:10:53,238
..is printed in Pakistan.
Or documents from Pakistan..

1573
02:10:53,976 --> 02:10:56,736
..are printed in his
own printing press..

1574
02:10:57,318 --> 02:10:58,598
..which is in
Maharashtra, India.

1575
02:11:02,718 --> 02:11:06,118
Your Honor, these
two great people..

1576
02:11:06,616 --> 02:11:08,336
..forgot this small point.

1577
02:11:09,394 --> 02:11:13,074
And to prove Arjun and
Hyder to be traitors..

1578
02:11:13,424 --> 02:11:14,864
..they printed these fake
documents of Pakistan..

1579
02:11:16,092 --> 02:11:18,692
..in their own printing press.

1580
02:11:20,337 --> 02:11:21,857
Arrest them.

1581
02:11:21,964 --> 02:11:25,364
Your Honor, he's
misleading the court.

1582
02:11:26,235 --> 02:11:29,875
Because this case isn't a case
of forgery, but of murder.

1583
02:11:30,272 --> 02:11:31,912
And no one can change
the truth that..

1584
02:11:32,017 --> 02:11:34,377
..the accused has
killed 18 people.

1585
02:11:35,208 --> 02:11:37,568
Does his lawyer
have any evidence..

1586
02:11:38,262 --> 02:11:40,702
..which will prove that
this murder wasn't a crime?

1587
02:11:41,906 --> 02:11:43,066
I have that
evidence, Your Honor.

1588
02:11:43,151 --> 02:11:46,231
Then present that evidence
and prove Arjun innocent.

1589
02:11:49,881 --> 02:11:51,881
Why are you so silent?
Show us the evidence.

1590
02:11:54,196 --> 02:11:58,404
I have the evidence, but I
can't present it in court.

1591
02:12:01,786 --> 02:12:03,906
Do you know that this
statement may also..

1592
02:12:04,879 --> 02:12:06,999
..result in the guilty
being awarded death penalty?

1593
02:12:08,173 --> 02:12:08,914
Yes, sir.

1594
02:12:10,888 --> 02:12:12,848
Sentence Arjun to death.

1595
02:12:13,115 --> 02:12:15,355
I'm asking you for
the last time..

1596
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:17,640
..what was the reason
for the murder?

1597
02:12:21,761 --> 02:12:23,281
Answer me, Mr. Samar Singh.

1598
02:12:24,668 --> 02:12:26,275
Sentence him to death.

1599
02:12:27,754 --> 02:12:29,194
I can't tell the reason.

1600
02:12:32,197 --> 02:12:33,077
Your Honor.

1601
02:12:53,472 --> 02:12:56,792
Your Honor, I'll
tell you the reason.

1602
02:12:57,597 --> 02:12:59,837
No, Rakhi! You go back.

1603
02:13:03,589 --> 02:13:05,269
I'm telling you. Go back, Rakhi.

1604
02:13:08,656 --> 02:13:11,136
Swear on me, Rakhi. Go back.

1605
02:13:14,289 --> 02:13:18,129
For mother's sake, Rakhi,
back off from this hell.

1606
02:13:22,394 --> 02:13:23,434
No, Brother.

1607
02:13:24,615 --> 02:13:29,495
Neither any promise, nor
God can stop me today..

1608
02:13:30,864 --> 02:13:32,813
..from telling the truth
about our relationship.

1609
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:35,540
Don't get emotional, Rakhi.
You'll be ruined.

1610
02:13:35,674 --> 02:13:37,194
Let me be ruined.

1611
02:13:38,643 --> 02:13:42,043
Today, I'll tell
what the truth is.

1612
02:13:47,103 --> 02:13:49,903
Your Honor, on the night
of the 1st of November..

1613
02:13:50,396 --> 02:13:53,876
..the brother of this CM,
Deputy CM Badrinath Trivedi..

1614
02:13:54,171 --> 02:13:57,531
..underworld don Zafar
Supari, Inspector Avasthi..

1615
02:13:57,842 --> 02:14:00,282
..this commissioner's
son and his men..

1616
02:14:01,239 --> 02:14:04,879
..kidnapped me and took
me to their farmhouse.

1617
02:14:12,516 --> 02:14:15,955
Your Honor, to rape me.

1618
02:14:16,119 --> 02:14:18,439
To gang rape me.

1619
02:14:20,254 --> 02:14:24,174
No, please. Brother!
- Come here.

1620
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:27,860
Leave me. Brother!
- Come on, Inspector.

1621
02:14:27,950 --> 02:14:33,030
Brother! - Good.
- Save me, Brother. Leave me. No!

1622
02:14:36,023 --> 02:14:38,103
No! Brother!

1623
02:14:38,157 --> 02:14:40,997
Come on. Come. - No. Save me.

1624
02:14:41,329 --> 02:14:43,569
No! - Save me, Brother.

1625
02:14:44,676 --> 02:14:45,996
Brother!

1626
02:14:49,721 --> 02:14:51,721
Brother!

1627
02:14:56,771 --> 02:14:58,571
No! No!

1628
02:14:59,996 --> 02:15:02,316
(Laughs)

1629
02:15:13,696 --> 02:15:15,176
(Phone rings)

1630
02:15:16,470 --> 02:15:17,710
(Phone rings)

1631
02:15:19,568 --> 02:15:21,768
Encounter Specialist,
Arjun Ranawat.

1632
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:24,800
I'm Zafar Supari.

1633
02:15:25,303 --> 02:15:26,983
If you have the guts..

1634
02:15:27,556 --> 02:15:30,236
..then come to the
CM's farmhouse..

1635
02:15:31,738 --> 02:15:34,898
..and stop your sister
from being raped.

1636
02:15:35,184 --> 02:15:36,624
Zafar Supari.

1637
02:15:57,135 --> 02:15:58,735
(Tires squealing)

1638
02:16:09,601 --> 02:16:10,481
(Gunshot)

1639
02:16:12,401 --> 02:16:13,241
(Gunshot)

1640
02:16:15,041 --> 02:16:15,841
(Gunshot)

1641
02:16:17,341 --> 02:16:18,101
(Gunshot)

1642
02:16:19,422 --> 02:16:20,182
(Gunshot)

1643
02:16:21,850 --> 02:16:22,610
(Gunshot)

1644
02:16:25,902 --> 02:16:26,622
(Gunshot)

1645
02:16:28,641 --> 02:16:29,521
(Gunshot)

1646
02:16:31,162 --> 02:16:31,882
(Gunshot)

1647
02:16:42,022 --> 02:16:42,662
(Gunshot)

1648
02:16:44,083 --> 02:16:44,723
(Gunshot)

1649
02:16:59,968 --> 02:17:00,648
(Gunshot)

1650
02:17:02,337 --> 02:17:03,017
(Gunshot)

1651
02:17:03,722 --> 02:17:04,362
(Gunshot)

1652
02:17:06,197 --> 02:17:06,957
(Gunshot)

1653
02:17:08,222 --> 02:17:08,982
(Gunshot)

1654
02:17:11,018 --> 02:17:11,858
(Gunshot)

1655
02:17:16,482 --> 02:17:17,602
(Glass shatters)

1656
02:17:22,704 --> 02:17:24,264
(Grunts)

1657
02:17:30,324 --> 02:17:31,764
(Grunts)

1658
02:17:55,045 --> 02:17:56,085
(Grunts)

1659
02:18:00,504 --> 02:18:01,704
(Glass shatters)

1660
02:18:30,756 --> 02:18:34,036
(Screams)

1661
02:18:51,879 --> 02:18:52,799
(Rakhi crying)

1662
02:19:23,372 --> 02:19:24,372
Brother!

1663
02:19:26,772 --> 02:19:27,932
Brother!

1664
02:19:28,732 --> 02:19:29,652
Arjun!

1665
02:20:52,087 --> 02:20:53,767
(Sobbing)

1666
02:20:59,707 --> 02:21:02,027
This is the truth of that night.

1667
02:21:03,076 --> 02:21:07,836
Now does anyone want to know why
my brother has kept his silence..

1668
02:21:08,617 --> 02:21:11,457
..and wished for
a death penalty?

1669
02:21:12,917 --> 02:21:13,957
Just wait, Your Honor.

1670
02:21:15,161 --> 02:21:17,961
Your Honor, I'm a soldier.

1671
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:21,200
I don't want a life of mercy.

1672
02:21:21,898 --> 02:21:25,338
My only wish is either
victory or martyrdom.

1673
02:21:27,172 --> 02:21:28,682
Give me death penalty.

1674
02:21:29,376 --> 02:21:30,976
Because I'll come back again.

1675
02:21:32,165 --> 02:21:34,325
And to save the
pride of my country..

1676
02:21:35,007 --> 02:21:36,447
..I'll pick up weapons again.

1677
02:21:38,663 --> 02:21:41,863
Because Arjun had always taken
up weapons on the battleground..

1678
02:21:42,337 --> 02:21:45,657
..in the past, the
present and the future.

1679
02:21:49,682 --> 02:21:54,122
This court hereby orders
a case to be filed..

1680
02:21:55,152 --> 02:21:57,112
..against the Chief
Minister, Kashinath Trivedi..

1681
02:21:58,219 --> 02:22:01,019
..and Commissioner Deshpande
on counts of treason.

1682
02:22:03,363 --> 02:22:09,087
And with that, the one who took up
arms for the safety of the society..

1683
02:22:09,985 --> 02:22:11,505
..Arjun Ranawat is declared..

1684
02:22:12,529 --> 02:22:15,489
..free from all charges
leveled against him.

1685
02:22:17,848 --> 02:22:19,888
Long live Arjun Ranawat!

1686
02:22:19,968 --> 02:22:22,048
Long live Arjun Ranawat!

1687
02:22:22,128 --> 02:22:24,288
Long live Arjun Ranawat!

1688
02:22:24,368 --> 02:22:26,208
Long live Arjun Ranawat!

1689
02:22:30,071 --> 02:22:32,951
"In the holy book of
Gita Lord Krishna said.."

1690
02:22:33,816 --> 02:22:37,016
"..to kill evil is not a sin."

1691
02:22:41,271 --> 02:22:44,151
"In the holy book of
Gita Lord Krishna said.."

1692
02:22:44,975 --> 02:22:48,255
"..to kill evil is not a sin."

1693
02:22:48,661 --> 02:22:51,701
"Death destroys the body."

"The soul is immortal."

"Always fight for justice."

1696
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:09,068
"Every drop of my blood
is for guarding you"

1697
02:23:09,150 --> 02:23:16,849
"Every drop of my blood
is for guarding you"

1698
02:23:19,642 --> 02:23:24,935
"We are proud of our country"

1699
02:23:25,221 --> 02:23:26,554
"We are proud!'

1700
02:23:26,824 --> 02:23:32,586
"We will live in victory
and die in victory"

1701
02:23:32,721 --> 02:23:34,054
"Die in victory"

1702
02:23:38,499 --> 02:23:41,641
"Uniform is our pride."

1703
02:23:42,236 --> 02:23:46,363
"Uniform is our belief."

1704
02:23:49,689 --> 02:23:52,824
"Uniform is our pride."

1705
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:57,046
"Uniform is our belief."

1706
02:23:57,134 --> 02:24:00,268
"Uniform is our identity."

1707
02:24:00,816 --> 02:24:04,340
"Uniform God is our."

1708
02:24:04,554 --> 02:24:09,943
"Gave birth to the country."

1709
02:24:10,102 --> 02:24:17,371
"Every drop of my blood
is for guarding you"

1710
02:24:17,467 --> 02:24:25,324
"Every drop of my blood

1711
02:24:28,086 --> 02:24:32,626
