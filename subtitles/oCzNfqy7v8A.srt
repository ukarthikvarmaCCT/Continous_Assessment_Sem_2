1
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So doctor..

2
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,240
how is the 106 dialysis
patient doing?

3
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,520
How's the creatinine level?

4
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,634
Still not the best and..

5
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:04,000
she's responding to the EPO injections pretty well.

6
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,160
Hi Doctor!

7
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,660
Hey hi!

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How's dad doing?

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,340
His blood pressure is pretty high and uh..

10
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,000
even the ECG levels are not normal.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,572
uhhh..Next 24 hours is pretty critical for him.

12
00:02:16,572 --> 00:02:17,072
Okay.

13
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:18,000
We are monitoring him.

14
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,820
Okay.

15
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,230
If his body is stable and if everything goes well,

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,220
we'll schedule the surgery for the 24th.

17
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,300
Let's hope for the best.

18
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,680
We'll do our best! You take care okay.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,060
mm Yeah!! The EPO injections...

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
huh..she's responding to the EPO Injections pretty well.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well! Good let's maintain the dosage
for the next 48 hours.

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Farhaan..

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,127
Farhaan: Hey Nidhi..hey hey.. hey hey..

24
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:53,000
What's going on?

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,320
Are you ok?

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What happened?

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,500
Are you at the hospital?

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah

29
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,120
I am at hospital only.

30
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,580
My dad I feel, I don't think so he'll make it.

31
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,000
Farhaan: Hey Nidhi.. hold on, hold on..

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I am here with you. OK..

33
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,880
Tell me what is the doctor have to..

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Nothing makes sense to me Farhaan..

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,960
I don't know..

36
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,160
Farhaan: Nidhi.. look. look listen..

37
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,880
Listen to me..

38
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,290
We will get through this together...

39
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,000
Calm down ok! ok?

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah..yeah...

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,960
Farhaan: Just, just.. just be strong for your Dad, Nidhi. Ok...

42
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,020
I am sure he will respond to the medicines.

43
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,100
I am with you...

44
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,000
I have to leave..See you tomorow..

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow...

46
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,820
Seriously?!! You came at this hour?

47
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,513
It's okay..

48
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:23,000
I just called you because I was feeling helpless.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,132
You didn't need to come..

50
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,360
It's okay.. mmm

51
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,430
What does the doctor advise..

52
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,000
as the treatment plan?

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The doctors are saying, they have to wait and see

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,490
how he's responding to the medicines after the surgery.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,479
and then decide the treatment plan.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,500
You know what?

57
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,488
He is.. he's not responding to the medicines.

58
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:47,349
His BP is still high.

59
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:48,000
It's okay.

60
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,620
I don't know.. I don't know! I really don't know..

61
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,169
Clearly..

62
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:55,720
Things are so uncertain.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,530
You should be going, it's getting late...

64
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,000
It's okay. Fine, chill.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
hmm..

66
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,200
After 16 years...

67
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,760
So Maya, mmm... 32 people, awesome number no?

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,440
Not bad at all for a reunion after 16 years!

69
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,940
I am so excited!

70
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,660
Yeah man, tell me about it! I just can't wait!

71
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,828
By the way umm...

72
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:46,300
Are you planning to call him, Nidhi?

73
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,460
Who?

74
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,600
Oh! You know who..

75
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,260
Farhaan !?

76
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,440
Ah ha!

77
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,160
No Maya, there is is no way I'm going to call him.

78
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,240
I mean- it's been such a long time...

79
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,980
Sixteen years! It's not a joke.

80
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,660
No, I'm not gonna call him.

81
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,620
You have no clue where he is?

82
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,600
No n..no clue where he is..

83
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,400
and I don't think so anybody knows either.

84
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,600
I looked him up everywhere ...

85
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,500
Uh huh.

86
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,000
He is not on social media.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah..

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,500
No ya, let's just forget it.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,500
OK,

90
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,000
never mind..hmmm

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,180
You know, I just thought it would be fun!

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Actually..

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It will be a nice idea to call him!

94
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:30,500
What you think?

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Ahh.. Nidhi! You are unbelievable!

96
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,410
Seriously..

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,849
Man...

98
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll tell you something..

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You know, you do one thing..

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Watch 96.

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,240
Ha, a movie.

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,405
I don't know if I will have time. I'll see.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But why do you want to me to watch?

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And they meet after 21 years or so..

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000

No no! Leave it.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,480
Forget what I wrote no, Maya.

122
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,820
Oh ya!

See, Worst case- what will happen?

126
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:12,000
Either he will come, or he wont come.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,500
Big deal.

128
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,000
What difference does it make?

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,540
Hmm.

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But I don't have his contact ya.

Did he do Masters at Boulder?

144
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,800

Oh! Oh wow! Really?

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,360
How did you find him?

149
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,000
My 6th sense!

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,820
Linked in? Seriously? Even I searched..

00:08:57,926 --> 00:08:59,000
I never found him! How come?

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,440
Because my dear Nidhi! It's an art!

154
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,000
You want more details or no?

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,774

156
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:06,000

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,640

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,480

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,809
"It's neither light nor shade"

188
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:27,000
"What is this selfishness of yours?"

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
"You don't feel settled at any place?"

190
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,640
Nidhi..

191
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,980
Nidhi!!..

192
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What is the status with Farhaan?

193
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,000
Found him!

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What?

195
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Anu! Focus!

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
"You have become your own God"

197
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
"You swam all the seven oceans"

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
"Still you are dry inside your heart"

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
"Why do you remain so?"

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
"O great one, heed to this"

201
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
"O great thinker, heed to this"

202
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
"Come, your shadows are calling you"

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
""O great one, heed to this"

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
"O great thinker, heed to this"

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
"Come, your shadows are calling you"

206
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,240
What huh?

207
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,800
You are not going without

208
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,000

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,020
What is going on with you?

237
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000

So.. nervous!

240
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't know why I got into this.

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,500
All because of you only!

242
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,000
You and your out of the world plan!

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,360
Oyee! Now you blame me?

244
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,200
As always?

245
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,320
Nonsense..

246
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Of course!

247
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
How many times I told you?

248
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,280
No need!

249
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,760
You and your that movie 96

250
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,456
Ah so?

251
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So do one thing

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,380
Don't go!

253
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:56,880
Simple!

254
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,020
What?

255
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,940
What? "What?!"

256
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,460
You know what? Give me your phone

257
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,000

258
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,260
No no no.. its ok it's okay

259
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,000
I should be professional right?

260
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,460
Yeah right!

261
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,879
The professional you!

262
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,527
Ughhh!! Shhhh..

263
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,660
What's this gals?

264
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,580
Why are you guys sitting and yelling at each other

265
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,200
in the middle of the night?

266
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,500
Anu, you'll understand me!

267
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,400
You will understand my state of mind better, OK!

268
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,000
See my life right?

269
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Was all perfect!

270
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,281
Until this thing happened..

271
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,000
and suddenly I feel my life is all upside down.

272
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't know what to do!

273
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,782
About what?!

274
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh!! oh oh.. Farhaan?

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh dear, chill no!

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,940
You're just meeting him only right?

277
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That too in a restaurant..

278
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,630
It's going to be casual and nice! Trust me!

279
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,600
You think so?

280
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,000
Absolutely and..

281
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No! This is NOT going to turn your life upside down..ok?

282
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,960
Both of you have your separate lives. Right?

283
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,970
I know, I know, I know it will be all ok..

284
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,842
But Anu! I have this weird feeling

285
00:14:54,842 --> 00:14:56,990
as if butterflies are churning inside..

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
See that's exactly why I said, don't go!

287
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,380
Keep quiet, right Maya!

288
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,000
Leave her alone please..

289
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
As it is she is confused..

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,160
Listen.

291
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,360
You go.. ok?

292
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,480
Go meet him..ok?

293
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:14,000
It's going be casual and nice- right!

294
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,190
You'll enjoy this

295
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:15,690
okay

296
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,500
Ok, let's go to sleep..

297
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,000
But guys my biggest worry is none of this..

298
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What if after all this drama..

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
he doesn't show up only?

300
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That will be epic, no!?

301
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,100
No change! Still the same!

302
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,239
You as well..

303
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:12,680
Straight out of college..

304
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,480
Absolutely no change huh!

305
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,620
Really? Thank you..!

306
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,560
Seems like you brought the rains from Seattle huh?

307
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,560
Was hoping to see the sun for sure..

308
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,390
but,  you know what?

309
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The rains do make me feel at home..

310
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,720
Okay..

311
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,419
So tell me why now?

312
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,760
How did you find me?

313
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,440
Uhhhh..

314
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,500
So, I used to google you..

315
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,580
and uhh..

316
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,280
Maya found you on Linked in recently

317
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,800
and that's how I got your number.

318
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,776
Simple na?

319
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:51,420
Uhhh..

320
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,700
My phone number is not on Linked In

321
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
and I'm actually not friends with Maya either..

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Soo...

323
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You know the problem is you know me too well..

324
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,740
and I simply cannot lie to you..

325
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
OK! I'll tell you..

326
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,320
uhhh..

327
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,120
Maya found your Linked in

328
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,000
and that's how we got to know your work place..

329
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,500
And uhh..

330
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,120
I got onto people finder..

331
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,480
Wait.. wait..what?

332
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,800
And...uhh

333
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,000
I got 3 numbers from there.

334
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,080
Wait people finder?

335
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:24,730
Which means, you subscribed?

336
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,900
Yeah! How else?

337
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,000
No way!

338
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,680
So, for someone who is totally cut out from this world..

339
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,040
What other way to contact?

340
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Okay go on..

341
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yeah so.. hmm

342
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,220
I had three numbers..

343
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,540
And I randomly picked a number and texted.

344
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,503
It ended up being a wrong guy!!

345
00:18:43,503 --> 00:18:44,914
Can you imagine?

346
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:48,000
I texted a complete random stranger

347
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh man!

348
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,733
You texted a random person,

349
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,000
and you didn't know it wasn't me?

350
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,100
Yeah!! how am I supposed to know?!

351
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,620
Oh come on! That's ridiculous huh..

352
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,120
Well! To start with..

353
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,000
You were not the most receptive person..

354
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,500
Were you?

355
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,000
Oh!

356
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,193
Then the 2nd number..

357
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:08,180
had the picture of your daughters..

358
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,171
The older one-

359
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:10,340
looks ditto like you..

360
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,700
and that's how I confirmed..

361
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,400
Amazing na?!

362
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,240
Nidhi..

363
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,560
Why after all these years?

364
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't know..

365
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Hmm..

366
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,180
Farhaan..

367
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,200
This..

368
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,000
this meaning you and me..

369
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,860
uh.. what do I say?

370
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,060
There is this box of memories which I hold on to..

371
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,500
and I completely own it!

372
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,500
Way...

373
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,360
Just way too special to me!

374
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,650
This is .. just a way..

375
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,380
of re visiting something

376
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,000
that was long left behind..

377
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
uhh.. I don't know.

378
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,443
I wish I knew..

379
00:20:37,443 --> 00:20:39,000
It's okay..

380
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You don't have to tell me..

381
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's ok..

382
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,000
No..

383
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I seriously don't know..

384
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Even.. even I..

385
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You know, even I have been thinking about this why part.

386
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's like..

387
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,580
How do I put it..

388
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,171
It's like..

389
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:53,050
You finish reading this book and,

390
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,340
there is this one page

391
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
which you really like.

392
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And you go back to fetch that page

393
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,780
and relive it once more..

394
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,700
That's what I guess..

395
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,780
I agree and no umm..

396
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't really want to know the reason..

397
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
it's okay..

398
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,720
OK!

399
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,560
Tell me

400
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,420

401
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,760
doing this past 16 years?

402
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,580
How's your family?

403
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,500
Been in Seattle..  pretty much..

404
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,330
Yeah pretty much in Seattle..uhh..

405
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,280
Working for Expedia.

406
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,000
Two sons..

407
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,400
and husband is a cardiologist..

408
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,452
Oh nice!

409
00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:39,660

00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,220

412
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,000
Let me show you this pic..

413
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,925
Ah.. beautiful family!

414
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:52,300
I told you no,

415
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,080

416
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Thanks

417
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,500
So tell me..

418
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,740
So why..

419
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,828
Why aren't you coming for the reunion boss?

420
00:22:00,828 --> 00:22:02,000
I.. I have a friend's wedding to attend..

421
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Sooo..I cant skip that.

422
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,500
Oh!

423
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,000
Otherwise you would have come no?

424
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,860
See, I knew..

425
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,000
Some things just don't change..

426
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Tell me how's your Mom doing?

427
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,660
Mom's okay.

428
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,140
It's been 16 years since Dad left us.

429
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,000
She is managing..

430
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,580
I know..

431
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,000
Those hospital days were a struggle- I know.

432
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Totally remember that

433
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yeah..

434
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,508
Do you remember the night when..

435
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:34,000
when you came to the hospital?

436
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400
and we spoke until dawn?

437
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah.. You were..

438
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,120
really amazing.

439
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,000
You handled it very well..

440
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,960
Thanks to you!

441
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,120
I think it's time for you to leave.

442
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,220
Time to pick up kids right?

443
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,060
Yeah..

444
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,340
Nidhi ya..

445
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's been too short uh..

446
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,296
One hour after 16 years..

447
00:22:59,296 --> 00:22:59,870
right?

448
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I know..

449
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Time was always short for us, no Farhaan?

450
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It was never enough..

451
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:11,940
Anyways..

452
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,247
We still made it!

453
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,440
So what time do you have to pick them?

454
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,580
In half an hour..

455
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,440
Okay there is still time.

456
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,180
Yes..

457
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,100
Man.. it is cold in here!

458
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,895
Take my jacket..

459
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:28,525
Thanks! But no thanks..

460
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:29,659
Okay, freeze then..

461
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,160
Oh. How will I return your jacket if I
take it?

462
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,360
In your next visit right?

463
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,059
Excuse me!

464
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yeah, of course..

465
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,080
Don't think too much okay...

466
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,260
Just take it.

467
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,180
Listen to me for a change, OK.

468
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,100
Thanks! But I'm good.

469
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,720
Listen I got to book my ride..

470
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,080
Nidhi...

471
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,900
Thanks for all this craziness..

472
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,760
It was worth it..

473
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,000
Stay in touch okay?

474
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:06,880
Yeah..

475
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,480
I will..

476
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,620
Looks like..

477
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,700
My car is parked there..

478
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,020
I guess this is it..

479
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,320
time to go..

480
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,690
bye.
