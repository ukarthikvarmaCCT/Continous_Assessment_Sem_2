'Surbhi, stop! Sister!'

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,560
'Surbhi!'

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,760

Sister!

Sister!

[sad music]

24
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,800
Sister, please forgive me.

25
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,160
I couldn't save you years ago.

26
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,080
I couldn't save
your memories, either.

27
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,200
Your farm and well

28
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,360
are going to be auctioned off.

29
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,000
Sister, this farm and well

30
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,600
is like a mother to our Nandu.

31
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,280
[crying]

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,760
What do I tell her, sister,

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,600
when she will ask me
where is her mother?

34
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,240

00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,680
Nandini!

42
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,120
Nandini!

43
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,320
Nandini!

44
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,480
Yes, tell me, Mehul.

45
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,320
Come quickly! Emergency!

46
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,840
- Nandini!
- I am coming.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,840
You make them practice. I am coming.

48
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,360
Nandini, hurry up.

49
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,560
Nandini!

00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,560
[intense music]

51
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,400
What happened, Mehul?

52
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,200
Nandini! The farm
is being auctioned off.

53
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,920
Uncle is in the bank. Think of
something quickly. What do we do?

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,080
Let's go home.

55
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,080
The auction is being
held in the bank.

56
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,720
Let's go home.

57
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,120
Yes, let's go.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,600
- What?
- Helmet.

59
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,760
I have worn it. Let's go.

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Hey!

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,920
[intense music]

62
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,160
Rs. 2,02,500.
Tell me if you want to give it.

63
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,360
Okay, let's go. Is there anyone?

64
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,360
Three lakh rupees!

65
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,720
Three lakh rupees!
Very good. Anyone else?

66
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,680
- Three lakh, fifty thousand rupees!
- Three lakh, fifty thousand rupees!

67
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,080
Four lakh, fifty thousand rupees!

68
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,880
Four lakh, fifty thousand rupees!
Very good.

69
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,400
It was the land of our ancestors.

70
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,800
I couldn't save it.

71
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,120
Aunt, I am sorry. Did you get hurt?

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,720
Get down.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,840
The hay has also finished.

74
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,360
There is no one to look
after the house except me.

75
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,320
No one is concerned
about anything except me.

76
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,880
What is going on?

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,360
Surbhi, you have been
ringing the bell since morning.

78
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,000
There is no one in
this house except me.

79
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Did someone give you grass?

80
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,040
No one does anything.

81
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,640
No one helps me.

82
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,120
No one does anything
in this house except Mani.

83
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
- I do all the work.
- Aunt!

84
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,360
What is this?
Where have you been since morning?

85
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,040
Forget all that. Put this aside.

86
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,840
One minute. Take this off.

87
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,200
[chuckles]

88
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,960
You have such a photogenic face.

89
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Come here. I will show you
how beautiful you are.

90
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Don't flatter me.

91
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,800
I am not flattering you.
I am telling the truth.

92
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,880
Wait a minute. Here.

93
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,920
Stand like this. Yes.

94
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,000
Here... Yes!

95
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,920
- Hey!
- Aunt!

96
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,120
Yes!

97
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,320
Aunt, do you know?

98
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,960
In Upleta, they put up big posters
of the pictures I click.

99
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,240
[sad music]

100
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,200
'Uncle.'

101
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,520
'All these ornaments...'

102
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,240
'Are they all ours?'

103
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,360
'Nandu, these are the ornaments'

104
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,400
'that my mother gave your mother.'

105
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,120
'And these are the ornaments
of my mother that I got.'

106
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,480
'I saved all these
for your wedding.'

107
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,080
'Why do we need so many ornaments?'

108
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,400
'What else does a bride
need except a nuptial chain?'

109
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,800
'Nandu, this is your dowry.'

110
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,800
[sad music]

111
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,760
[suspenseful music]

112
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,480
[suspenseful music]

113
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,360
Very good, Aunt. Very good.

114
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,400
Yes.

115
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,800
Okay.

116
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,480
Yes.

117
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,920
Come on.
This is the last auction of the day.

118
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,280
Ishwar Tambariya's farm.

119
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Six acres of land.
There is a well on the farm.

120
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,520
There is a fence as well.

121
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,920
And there is an electric pump too.

122
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,040
And the base price for this
is nine lakh rupees.

123
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,880
[intense music]

124
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,560
[intense music]

125
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,240
Thank you, Uncle.

126
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,040
Nine lakh rupees.
Tell me. Is there anyone?

127
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,680
Nine lakh and twenty-five
thousand rupees.

128
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,080
Nine lakh and twenty-five
thousand rupees.

129
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,080
Nine lakh and fifty thousand rupees.

130
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,360
Nine lakh and fifty thousand rupees.
One.

131
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,520
[intense music]

132
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,520
- Nine lakh and fifty thousand
rupees. Two. - Ten lakh rupees!

133
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,520
Ten lakh rupees.

134
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,600
Ten lakh rupees. One.

135
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,080
- Ten lakh rupees! Two. Ten lakh...
- Hold on!

136
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,680
[intense music]

137
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,280
Sorry

138
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,000
to stop your auction like this.

139
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,400
Sir. Here's the loan amount of ten
lakh rupees taken by Uncle Ishwar

140
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,880
and the interest in it.

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,960
You can take it.

142
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,400
It's twelve lakh fifty
thousand rupees.

143
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Please don't auction
my uncle's farm.

144
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,800
Okay. You...

145
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
You wait for a while.
I will tell you.

146
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,840
Okay.

147
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,320
[intense music]

148
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,440
Mr Ishwar owes eleven lakh and
seventy-five thousand to the bank.

149
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,800
You have paid for it.

150
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,960
So the auction can stop.

151
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,480
[intense music]

152
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,720
Sir, give me the file.

153
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,320
Come in, Mr Ishwar.

154
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,240
Mr Ishwar, you are so lucky.

155
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,160
Now, there is no interest or loan.

156
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,080
Now your farm will be with you.

157
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,720
Take this.

158
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,800
Sign on this.

159
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,640
Get it signed by the registrar too.

160
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,080
And take the receipt
of your money from outside.

161
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,640
Leave the money here.

162
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,720
The rest of the money
will be returned to you.

163
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,560
Uncle, I have seen
all these papers.

164
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,520
I will get the
registrar's sign on this.

165
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,000
- Mehul, you sit with Uncle
and make him drink tea. - Yes.

166
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,760
I'll be back. Come on, Mitesh.

167
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,680
It's hot. We'll drink
buttermilk instead of tea.

168
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,000
- Ms Nandini.
- Yes.

169
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,840
I believe that

170
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,400
you have saved the land
of the farm with great difficulty.

171
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,160
Sorry. I am Parag Kanhabar.

172
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,040
I work for the politician and MLA

173
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,920
Mr Arjan Khimji here.

174
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,760
As a well-wisher,
I have an offer for you.

175
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,160
If we offer you 20 lakh rupees
in return for your land

176
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,160
can you tell your uncle

177
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,640
to transfer your land to us?

178
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,360
Thank you for your offer.

179
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,240
But we don't want
to sell this farm.

180
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,920
Come on, Mitesh.

181
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,200
[intense music]

182
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,960
Yes, sir.

183
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,000
Sir,

184
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,640
the man's niece came

185
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,000
and stopped the auction.

186
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,120
What did you do, Nandu?
Have you gone mad?

187
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,880
You sold the ornaments.

188
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,000
Do you know what your aunt
will do if she finds out?

189
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,440
She will create havoc.

190
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,960
Uncle, you don't have to
tell Aunt anything right now.

191
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,320
It's wrong to hide the truth.

192
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,160
You hid it from us.
And from Aunt Mani.

193
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,720
Did you tell anyone

194
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,920
that you have mortgaged the farm?

195
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,800
Don't ask me questions.

196
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,680
The ornaments were
for your wedding.

197
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,440
You sold them for my land.

198
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,160
Uncle, the gold will
remain in the safe.

199
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,480
The gold will grow on the farm.

200
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,320
But you can't risk your land

201
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,200
for the ornaments.

202
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,520
Uncle, your daughter will leave

203
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,240
what will be left with you,
if you lose the farm as well?

204
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,080
It's good that Mitesh
told me everything.

205
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,040
You come in the rickshaw with Mehul.
Uncle, come with me.

206
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,920
[happy music]

207
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,640
[happy music]

208
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,440
Uncle!

209
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,840
Uncle,

210
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,240
don't tell Aunt about the ornaments.

211
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,920
She will get worried.

212
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,320
I will explain it to Aunt later.

213
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,760
Dear, I am worried

214
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,400
about what I will offer
for your wedding.

215
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,880
Uncle, why are you worried?

216
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,920
I told you. A nuptial chain
is enough for a bride.

217
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,240
And my groom will bring
my nuptial chain.

218
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Uncle, am I so shameless

219
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,000
that I will sell your land
and wear ornaments?

220
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,880
Uncle, after mom left,
you have brought us up.

221
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,560
You brought us up.

222
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
You made us worthy.

223
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,040
You have given me
twice the love of a mother.

224
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh no!

225
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
- Uncle, mom.
- Mom?

226
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,880
- Mom!
- What mom?

227
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,520
Oh! I forgot the sweets!

228
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,120
[happy music]

229
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,560
- Why are you running?
- Sweets!

230
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,880
Where have you been since morning?

231
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,760
Later. I want to go to the farm.

232
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,440
What are you doing?

233
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,200
Oh God! This girl

234
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,080
is so troublesome.

235
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,360
I don't know
what will happen to her.

236
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,560
Enough.
I don't have to go to Rajkot.

237
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,880
- Box?
- Sweets.

238
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
Sweets?

239
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,240
Hey, give me some money.

240
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,760
- Me?
- Give it to me.

241
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,520
Where are you going in such a hurry?

242
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,720
- I will tell you later. Hey!
- Sorry.

243
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
He is a strange man.

244
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
- Uncle.
- Yes.

245
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,320
Where did she go to feed sweets
to in such a hurry?

246
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,040
- The one whose birthday is today.
- Birthday?

247
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,360
Didn't you understand?

248
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,600
[dramatic music]

249
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,440
[dramatic music]

250
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,800
Who is calling?

251
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,440
Mr Naren Ratan Singh.

252
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,400
Tell me, Mr Naren. Greetings.

253
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,520
Mr Mehul. I have left from Upleta.

254
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,520
I am coming to see the girl today.

255
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,680
Today? You were supposed
to come tomorrow, Mr Naren.

256
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,160
Yes. The work in the factory
got over before time.

257
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,320
So, I thought of completing
this program as soon as possible.

258
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,360
You are great, Mr Naren.

259
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,120
No problem. Come here.

260
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,360
Hey! Sir.

261
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,320
The boy who was supposed to come
to see the girl is coming today.

262
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,480
- What?
- Yes.

263
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,120
Go inside and tell
your aunt. Come on. Quick.

264
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,160
- Aunt Mani.
- Yes.

265
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,840
The boy who was supposed to come
to see the girl is coming today.

266
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,760
What?

267
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,720
He is supposed to reach
Upleta in some time.

268
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,040
Oh, God! How is that possible?

269
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,480
When will I get ready?

270
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,040
Mani. The boy is coming
to see the girl.

271
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,320
He is not coming to see you.

272
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes. But I have to get dressed up.

273
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,480
You should get the girl dressed up.

274
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,800
Why are you getting dressed up?

275
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,000
Okay, forget about me.

276
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,320
But won't he give the girl
a chance to get ready?

277
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,200
Her eyebrows, bleach, facial are
pending. She is yet to get ready.

278
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,680
- And, Mehul.
- Yes.

279
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,560
First, call Sheetal.

280
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,160
Tell her that I am sending
the sweets with you.

281
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,040
And then call Nandini.

282
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,480
And tell her that the boy is coming
today instead of tomorrow.

283
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,880
Yes.

284
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,360
[soft music]

285
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,520
[soft music]

286
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,760
Sweets for you, Mom.

287
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,120
Happy birthday, Mom.

288
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,440
[song playing]

289
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,640
[song playing]

290
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,200
[phone ringing]

291
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes, Mehul. Tell me.

292
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,240
'Aunt, the boy is coming
to see the girl today.'

293
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,840
What? Is he coming today?

294
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,040
Yes.

295
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,760
Did you tell Nandini?

296
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,320
I am calling Nandini.

297
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,560
I thought I would call you first.

298
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,040
I will send Nandini to your house.

299
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,040
And that I am coming
there as well with the sweets.

300
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,160
Oh, God!

301
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,120
Yes. Nandini.

302
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,600
[phone ringing]

303
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,640
Yes, Mehul.

304
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,200
Nandini, come home soon.

305
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,080
Mr Hemraj's son from Rajkot,
Naren Ratan Singh

306
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,240
who was supposed to come
tomorrow is coming today.

307
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,640
What? When will I get ready?

308
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,800
And when will I prepare everything?

309
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,800
That's why I am telling
you to come home, Sister.

310
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,360
[happy music]

311
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,080
[happy music]

312
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,720
Greetings, Uncle!

313
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,520
I am sorry! Aunt. I got late.

314
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,560
It's okay.
The boy hasn't turned up yet.

315
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,040
So make some 'Khandvi' quickly.

316
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,760
I have kept the flour
and curd there.

317
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,120
What is this Aunt?

318
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,840
Aunt, why did you order
so many things from the market?

319
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,560
You could have
ordered 'Khandvi' as well.

320
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,240
You can't get 'Khandvi'
like this, in the market.

321
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,840
And you should serve
something homemade, too.

322
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,120
Forget it, Aunt.
I understand everything.

323
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,720
You are going to serve
homemade 'Khandvi'

324
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,280
as 'Khandvi' made by Vishakha

325
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,440
in front of the boy's family.

326
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,200
Everyone does this.

327
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
A little white lie isn't a sin.

328
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,400
[soft music]

329
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,320
Aunt, Uncle says that no matter
how trivial the lies are

330
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
relationships are not based on lies.

331
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,040
You will serve this 'Khandvi'
saying it's prepared by Vishakha.

332
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,720
After marriage, her in-laws

333
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,320
will ask her to prepare 'Khandvi'.
What will she do then?

334
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,440
Her lies will be exposed
in front of Naren.

335
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,080
You ask too many questions, girl.

336
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,160
Just make the 'Khandvi' quickly.

337
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,120
And teach Vishakha
before her marriage.

338
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,160
Make it quickly so that the
moment they eat 'Khandvi'

339
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,800
Vishakha's wedding gets fixed.

340
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,360
Hurry up.

341
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,120
The boy will be here any moment.

342
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,920
Mr Hitesh, Naren Kumar is here.

343
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,200
Welcome.

344
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,320
Greetings!

345
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,360
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

346
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,480
Come. Sit.

347
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,520
How are you all?

348
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,760
- We are fine.
- Please sit.

349
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,800
Please sit.

350
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,520
Uh...

351
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
I am sorry.

352
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,600
I got a little late.

353
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,280
What? You didn't get late.

354
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,680
You are early by an entire day.

355
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,960
[laughter]

356
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,160
Aunt Sheetal keeps cracking jokes.

357
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,640
Mr Naren, he is Uncle Hitesh,
Vishakha's father.

358
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,560
And she is Vishakha's mother,
Mrs Sheetal.

359
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:16,760
And he is Mr Hemraj's son,
Mr Naren from Rajkot.

360
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,440
So, I have introduced you to all.

361
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,080
Vishakha, get the drinks.

362
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,280
Vishakha.

363
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,360
- I hope there was no problem
in coming here. - No problem.

364
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,680
Vishakha is here.

365
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,600
She is Vishakha,

366
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,920
- my daughter.
- Greetings.

367
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,480
Greetings.

368
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,440
Have a drink.

369
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,960
Yes. Thank you so much.

370
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,040
- Where is 'Khandvi'?
- Oh yes.

371
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
Where is 'Khandvi'?

372
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,080
Give me 'Khandvi'.

373
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,680
Wow! Everything is amazing.

374
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,480
Taste 'Khandvi'.
Vishakha has made it.

375
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,320
She has come third in the

376
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,640
inter-district
Master Chef competition.

377
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,680
Wow! It's really nice.

378
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,120
Wow! Vishakha's 'Khandvi'
has passed the test.

379
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,760
Now, it's best if Vishakha
passes the test as well.

380
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,480
Yes. Naren Kumar.

381
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,120
If you want to talk to Vishakha,

382
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,920
- you can talk to her.
- Actually...

383
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,640
Vishakha, take him
to the garden outside.

384
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,400
You go. Yes. Calmly.

385
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,240
- Talk to her calmly.
- Yes.

386
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,160
Please. After you...

387
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,360
[soft music]

388
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,080
He looks good.

389
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,040
I don't know if Vishakha
will get along with him.

390
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
Come in.

391
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,120
Mr Naren, wow! Vishakha...

392
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,760
Hey...

393
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,520
[intense music]

394
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,040
[intense music]

395
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,520
Vishakha, what happened?

396
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,240
Why were you crying?

397
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,320
What did he say?

398
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,840
Tell me. What happened?

399
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,320
What happened? Vishakha...

400
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,560
Did you like Vishakha?

401
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,920
Yes. She is a nice girl.

402
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,520
Very nice.

403
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,000
Wow! So...

404
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,000
Mr Naren likes Vishakha. Wow!

405
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,640
Thank God!

406
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,520
- Mehul, call the priest.
- Yes.

407
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,440
We want to figure out
an auspicious day.

408
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,400
We need an auspicious day.

409
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,640
Yes. Hold on.

410
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,760
Mr Mehul...

411
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,080
It's a matter of marriage.

412
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,480
Before we move ahead

413
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,520
let's talk about the dowry.

414
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,920
[tense music]

415
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,200
Greedy man!

416
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,440
He looks so modern

417
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,600
but talks about dowry.

418
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,800
Dowry?

419
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,400
Tell me, Mr Naren.

420
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,640
Look, my parents

421
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,920
will make you understand
about the basic dowry.

422
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,840
But...

423
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,360
Actually, Hitesh.

424
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,920
I need something as well.

425
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,560
I just need two things.

426
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,120
First,

427
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,040
I need a fancy

428
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,440
automatic car.

429
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,040
[tense music]

430
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,800
And second,

431
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,080
I just need around 1 kg of gold.

432
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,120
[tense music]

433
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,160
[tense music]

434
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,920
Is he here to marry Vishakha
or make a deal?

435
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,800
[sobbing]

436
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,920
You were crying because of this?

437
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,040
Huh?

438
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Vishakha?

439
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,200
[sobbing]

440
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,520
Mr Naren Kumar, but...

441
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,560
This is too much.

442
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,600
- Uncle Hitesh...
- Mr Hitesh...

443
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,320
We don't

444
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,680
bargain in marriages.

445
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,240
It's considered inauspicious.

446
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,440
[sobbing]

447
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,960
Hold on and stop crying.

448
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,640
I'll deal with him.

449
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,240
You were talking about a car.

450
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,880
That depreciates, you know?

451
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,040
The value of property increases.

452
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,680
A mansion

453
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,960
or 100 to 150 acres
of agricultural land.

454
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,760
Isn't that a better investment?

455
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,360
You're right.

456
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,760
If...

457
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,520
we get the value, then...

458
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,880
I mean, it's fine.

459
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,480
And gold is fine.

460
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,440
But don't you think
diamonds are forever?

461
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,040
I love diamonds.

462
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,280
Even better.

463
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,640
Me too. Okay, fine.

464
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
We'll give you the car

465
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,240
and gold you asked for.

466
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,120
And the land and diamonds

467
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,160
that I asked for,

468
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,320
you'll give them to us.

469
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,080
[tense music]

470
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,760
So shall I consider it done
between you and Vishakha?

471
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,080
Mehul,

472
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,440
when did the groom's
family start giving dowry?

473
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,320
It's the age of equality.

474
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,440
So, the exchange will also be equal.

475
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,760
[tense music]

476
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,360
What happened?
Why are you staring at me?

477
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
Did I say something wrong?

478
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,200
Nandini. You go inside.

479
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,640
- I will talk to him.
- No, Mehul.

480
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,120
The wrong customs that
are being followed for ages

481
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,920
we cannot insult
our traditions in its name.

482
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,080
Nandini. You go inside.
Let me talk to him.

483
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,920
Mr Mehul, did you invite
me for insulting me?

484
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
I am not capable
of insulting anybody

485
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,840
neither is it my upbringing.

486
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,880
You said so much despite that.

487
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,680
I disagree with the alliance.

488
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,720
We disagree with the alliance.

489
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,520
Relationships are
not made out of greed,

490
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,400
but by respect.

491
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,640
And the one who asks for money,

492
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,800
we should donate money to them.

493
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,720
Not get our daughters
married to them.

494
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
[tense music]

495
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,120
[song playing]

496
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,800
[song playing]

497
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,880
[song playing]
