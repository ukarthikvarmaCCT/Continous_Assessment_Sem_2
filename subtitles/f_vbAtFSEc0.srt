1
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,541
When Governor Scott visited Adilabad last time...

2
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:14,250
...he brought back a little girl with him.

3
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,375
That girl belongs to the Gond tribe, sir.

4
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:19,625
So what?

5
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,166
Do they have horns on their head?

6
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,166
Mother

7
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,333
They have a protector.

8
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,583
To capture the tiger,

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,875
We need a hunter.

10
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,083
There’s only one man who can do it, sir.

11
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,416
Your friendship is more valuable than this life, brother.

12
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,000
I’ll die with pride.

13
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,041
Don’t leave me here, brother.

14
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,125
I keep remembering mother.

15
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,916
For the crimes you’ve committed against the British Government.

16
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:37,791
I’m arresting you.

17
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:46,041
We shouldn’t be scared anymore.

18
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,250
We should surge forward!

19
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,333
Whoever comes in our way needs to be eliminated.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,625
It’s very dangerous.

21
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,750
You’ll lose your life.

22
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,500
I’ll give it away happily.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,916
The weapons will come on their own in search of their war.

24
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,916
Bheem, 

25
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,875
How long do we fight these jackals?

26
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,333
Let’s hunt down the lion!
