00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,111
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,111 --> 00:00:02,589
The year 1945.

3
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:03,833
on 5th December, 

4
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:05,591
at 10 past 2 in the afternoon,

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,995
5 torpedo bomber aircraft of the US Navy,

6
00:00:08,995 --> 00:00:10,772
took off from Florida.

7
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:13,681
This mission was called Flight 19.

8
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,041
It was a 3-hour long routine training mission.

9
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,116
It wasn't anything special,

10
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:22,446
they were simply flying to conduct their regular training missions.

11
00:00:22,446 --> 00:00:24,192
There were 14 crew members on the flight,

12
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:26,539
led by their flight leader,

13
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:29,729
a highly experienced pilot and war veteran.

14
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:33,829
These five planes flew east from Florida.

15
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:35,449
Everything was normal

16
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:36,599
the weather was clear,

17
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,739
but about 2 hours after the takeoff,

18
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,900
their squadron leader reported that

19
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,511
there were sudden problems in their compass.

20
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,329
Their compass stopped working.

21
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,266
They take out their backup compass,

22
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:49,437
but the backup compass failed too.

23
00:00:49,437 --> 00:00:51,793
They can't determine their actual position.

24
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:53,636
They ask the pilots of the other planes

25
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,763
but their instruments were malfunctioning too.

26
00:00:56,763 --> 00:00:59,614
Lt Charles Carol Taylor was the squadron leader,

27
00:00:59,614 --> 00:01:01,271
after the compass broke down,

28
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:04,825
utterly confusing messages were sent over radio transmission. 

29
00:01:18,214 --> 00:01:20,177
The weather starts worsening.

30
00:01:20,177 --> 00:01:22,001
At 4:56 in the evening,

31
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:26,830
Taylor believes that their planes were flying over the Gulf of Mexico.

32
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:30,949
And that they needed to fly east to get back to Florida.

33
00:01:31,154 --> 00:01:36,152
So he commanded the rest of the planes to fly east.

34
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:39,053
But some of the crew abroad the flight believed

35
00:01:39,053 --> 00:01:41,859
that they were already flying east of Florida.

36
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:43,311
And that they needed to fly westwards.

37
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,681
Right after this order,

38
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:47,524
one of those planes sent a radio transmission saying

39
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:53,983
It shows that some of the crew members believed

40
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:57,511
that they had to fly westwards to get back home.

41
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:59,202
But the weather continues to worsen.

42
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,646
It's soon sunset and then the darkness of night. 

43
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:06,682
At this point, it is believed that the planes were actually 370km east of Florida.

44
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:09,023
At 7:04 PM,

45
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:12,342
we get the last radio transmission from Taylor.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,296
After this, all five planes are lost forever.

47
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:23,610
Till date,

48
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,819
we have no clue about these planes.

49
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,006
Where are they?
What happened to them?

50
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:29,739
After the disappearance of Flight 19,

51
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:32,980
a Search-and-Rescue Mariner aircraft took off,

52
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,765
with a crew of 13 people.

53
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:37,736
They were on the mission to find Flight 19.

54
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:40,394
But while looking for them, they too disappear. 

55
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,652
First, 14 people of Flight 19 disappeared, 

56
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:46,275
And then 13 people of the Mariner search-and-rescue aircraft.

57
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:47,588
For days after this,

58
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:50,593
a large scale air-and-sea search operation was carried out.

59
00:02:50,593 --> 00:02:53,677
One of the largest search operations of the time,

60
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:55,730
to look for both of these flights.

61
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,369
But they could find nothing.

62
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:59,754
Neither do they find a body of any person,

63
00:02:59,754 --> 00:03:02,275
nor any part of the aircraft.

64
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:03,600
Everything had disappeared.

65
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,029
Interestingly,

66
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:06,793
the area where both planes disappeared,

67
00:03:06,793 --> 00:03:10,886
today, we know that area as the Bermuda Triangle.

68
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:13,462
"We don't know which way is West."

69
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:15,096
"Over the past 50 years,

70
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:16,375
3,000 ships,

71
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,673
and 100 planes,

72
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:20,124
have gone missing in a mysterious stretch of water

73
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:21,370
in the Atlantic Ocean."

74
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,734
"Ships have gone missing

75
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:25,857
planes have gone missing."

76
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:30,360
"Known as the Devil's Triangle,

77
00:03:30,974 --> 00:03:32,612
a source of intrigue,

78
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,943
legend and fear,

79
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:37,912
this is the Bermuda Triangle."

80
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,493
The Bermuda Triangle is said to be

81
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:46,780
a very mysterious part of the ocean.

82
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,347
There, more than 100 aircraft and ships, have disappeared.

83
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:52,936
They were never found again.

84
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:55,961
This area lies between Florida in the USA,

85
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:58,971
Puerto Rico and the country Bermuda in the North.

86
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:01,423
It makes a triangular area like this.

87
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:07,034
Overall, this area spans more than 500,000 square miles.

88
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:10,267
Tales of the Bermuda Triangle are older than 500 years.

89
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:11,814
In 1492,

90
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:14,755
when Christopher Columbus set out to find the New World,

91
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:17,524
he reported that when he was passing by this area,

92
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,536
his compass stopped working.

93
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:23,344
And one night, when he looked at the sky from his ship,

94
00:04:23,344 --> 00:04:25,821
he saw a weird light.

95
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:29,982
A strange light that looked like a ball of fire.

96
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:34,291
And he saw that ball of fire fall out of the sky into the ocean.

97
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:35,920
This was the beginning of the mystery,

98
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,374
over the next few eras, several names were given to this area.

99
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,346
The Graveyard of the Atlantic.

100
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:42,911
The Sea of Doom.

101
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:44,485
Sargasso Graveyard.

102
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,229
These names were used in the 18th and 19th centuries.

103
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:50,373
But the name the Bermuda Triangle,

104
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:54,660
was used for the first time in 1964.

105
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,644
In a magazine called Argosy,

106
00:04:56,644 --> 00:05:02,152
there was an article by Vincent H. Gaddis in 1964,

107
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:05,369
titled 'The Deadly Bermuda Triangle.'

108
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:08,506
This was the first time the phrase Bermuda Triangle was used.

109
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:10,003
In this article,

110
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:13,802
many disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle over the last several decades

111
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,757
were summarised by him.

112
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:17,743
He had tried to link them all.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,654
Trying to create a mystery.

114
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,120
Claiming that there is something peculiar in this area of the ocean,

115
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,874
because of which so many aircraft and ships disappear.

116
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:31,533
Although, there were no explanations in the article as to why it happened.

117
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:37,496
But this made the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle the most popular at the time.

118
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:40,191
So popular that many books were written on it.

119
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:43,055
Many films and computer games were made,

120
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:46,271
there were songs on the Bermuda Triangle too.

121
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:48,013
Talking about some other incidents,

122
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:51,327
there was another horrifying incident in the year 1918.

123
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:53,788
It involved the USS Cyclops.

124
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:59,605
One of the biggest and fastest ships of the US Navy at the time.

125
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:02,573
It was a very important asset for the American Navy.

126
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:06,019
Especially when America began taking part in World War I.

127
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:10,699
It was used to transport the troops and coal.

128
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:13,006
On 4th March 1918,

129
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:16,496
306 people were aboard the USS Cyclops.

130
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:19,794
From a city near Washington, called the West Indies Baltimore, 

131
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:22,867
this ship began its journey towards Brazil.

132
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:27,303
Other than people, this ship was carrying 11,000 tonnes of manganese.

133
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,230
The journey was supposed to take 9 days.

134
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,623
Everything was fine with the departure of the ship.

135
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:33,888
The weather was clear.

136
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,523
While departing, the ships send the message

137
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,828
But this message,

138
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,645
was the last message from this ship.

139
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:45,301
After this ship began its journey

140
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:47,680
there was no news from it.

141
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,567
It had disappeared suddenly.

142
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,289
This shocked everyone.

143
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,485
One of the biggest ships of the US Navy,

144
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:54,805
a ship this huge,

145
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:56,584
how could it disappear suddenly?

146
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:59,482
If you think that this incident was mysterious,

147
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:02,145
a more daunting and frightful incident

148
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:03,967
was the Ellen Austin mystery.

149
00:07:04,464 --> 00:07:06,236
In the year 1881,

150
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:08,763
a 210 feet long ship

151
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,161
the Ellen Austin.

152
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,337
Travelling from London to New York,

153
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:13,671
quite common for the day,

154
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:16,470
many ships undertook this journey at the time.

155
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:22,445
But on its way, Ellen Austin encountered an unidentified ship.

156
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:24,722
Near the Bermuda Triangle area.

157
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:27,796
From the outside, this unidentified ship looked completely normal

158
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:31,783
but there was no trace of any humans aboard this ship.

159
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:34,152
There was no crew, no people at all.

160
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:36,472
The captain of Ellen Austin decided to 

161
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:39,631
go aboard the ship to see what had happened.

162
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:44,574
First, he brought his ship alongside this ship and waited for 2 days

163
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:47,803
so that they could see if there was anyone or even a trace of anyone, 

164
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:49,589
for any response from the other ship.

165
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:51,539
But there was no response for 2 days.

166
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:55,701
After that, the captain set foot on the unidentified ship.

167
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,123
There was a lot of stuff on this new ship.

168
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:00,605
And everything was in the place it should have been.

169
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,729
During that time, people were wary of pirates,

170
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:06,092
they used to be wary of an attack by the pirates

171
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:07,760
who would steal from the ships.

172
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,518
This unidentified ship hadn't been subjected to this.

173
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:14,425
Because all the valuable items of this ship were intact.

174
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:17,574
Due to this reason, the captain of Ellen Austin decided to

175
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:20,463
send some of his crew members on the ship,

176
00:08:20,463 --> 00:08:23,679
and that they would continue their journey with both ships.

177
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:27,285
For the first 2 days, both ships continued ahead normally.

178
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:29,566
But then came a storm.

179
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:31,840
Their paths separated

180
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,331
and the unidentified ship had disappeared.

181
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:36,006
After the storm was over,

182
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:39,601
the captain of the Ellen Austin tried to look for the ship,

183
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:43,110
and he spotted the ship with this spyglass at some distance.

184
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:44,943
When he reached near it,

185
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:49,587
there was again no trace of any human aboard the ship.

186
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:53,092
The crew members he had sent from his ship to the other ship,

187
00:08:53,092 --> 00:08:55,419
they had suddenly disappeared.

188
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:57,273
Where did they go?
What happened to them?

189
00:08:57,273 --> 00:08:58,405
We don't know.

190
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,264
But the ship was still intact.

191
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:06,895
It's said that the captain of Ellen Austin tried once again to bring the ship with him,

192
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:10,045
and sent some more crew members to steer the ship,

193
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:13,958
but again, after a few days, there was another storm,

194
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,901
and the same story repeated again.

195
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,709
This unidentified ship gets separated,

196
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:21,621
and the new crew members on it,
disappear once again.

197
00:09:21,621 --> 00:09:23,964
When Ellen Austin returned,

198
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,719
the owner of the ship was so terrified after hearing this story,

199
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:30,417
that he sold off the ship to a German company.

200
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:33,620
They change the name of this ship to Meta.

201
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,651
Yup, that's right,

202
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:37,736
the way that Mark Zuckerberg renamed Facebook into Meta,

203
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:40,720
this ship, too, was renamed Meta.

204
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:43,653
Isn't it an intriguing and legendary story?

205
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:45,612
But unfortunately, friends,

206
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:48,992
most probably, this incident is just a story.

207
00:09:48,992 --> 00:09:50,904
Because this incident is so old,

208
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:52,931
it is not possible to verify it properly.

209
00:09:52,931 --> 00:09:56,519
And the stories that are very popular historically,

210
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,419
those that are passed down to generations,

211
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:01,761
but that cannot be verified properly,

212
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:03,581
the truth cannot be unearthed,

213
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:06,000
we call those stories, Legends.

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,336
Urban Legends.

215
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:09,718
Many rational thinkers believe

216
00:10:09,718 --> 00:10:12,292
that the Bermuda Triangle is one such legend.

217
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:16,823
What lies behind the incidents of the Bermuda Triangle?

218
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:18,637
There are many theories for it.

219
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:20,982
Some people blame the aliens,

220
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:24,962
that aliens had come and abducted the aircraft and ships,

221
00:10:24,962 --> 00:10:26,662
and had taken these with them.

222
00:10:27,013 --> 00:10:31,308
Some people believe that there is a giant sea monster under the ocean,

223
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:33,149
that is behind the disappearances.

224
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:35,790
Some people claim that this area of the ocean is peculiar 

225
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,322
and the aircraft and vessels drown here.

226
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:40,759
These theories are truly outlandish.

227
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,978
So let's focus on the theories that

228
00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:45,281
sound a bit more scientific. 

229
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:47,980
One of the explanations is based on magnetism.

230
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,286
Friends, the thing is that

231
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:51,466
the North Pole of the Earth

232
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:53,122
and the magnetic North Pole,

233
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:54,759
are two distinct points.

234
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,649
So when you look towards North on a compass,

235
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:00,935
the compass is pointing towards the magnetic North Pole.

236
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:02,565
But the real North Pole

237
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:03,813
is somewhere close by.

238
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:05,577
It is known as the Geographic North Pole.

239
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:06,973
You can see it in this photo.

240
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:10,788
The difference between the Magnetic and Geographic North Poles. 

241
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:13,219
Normally, when people use the compass,

242
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:14,866
as has been done for ages,

243
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:16,604
they take this into account.

244
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:18,301
But there are some areas on the Earth,

245
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:20,621
if you use a compass in these areas,

246
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:24,647
you would find the Magnetic and Geographic North Poles at the same place.

247
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:26,366
The places where this happens are known as

248
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,483
the Agonic Lines.

249
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:31,548
These Agonic Lines shift with time.

250
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:33,457
But for the last 200-300 years,

251
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:37,738
the 0° line has been around or in the area of the Bermuda Triangle.

252
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,472
This can basically create confusion.

253
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:42,237
The next strange thing about this area is that

254
00:11:42,237 --> 00:11:44,178
the area in the Bermuda Triangle,

255
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:45,598
is quite shallow.

256
00:11:45,978 --> 00:11:48,298
When you look at it on a satellite map,

257
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:50,643
you'd see that the Bahamas,

258
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,835
Caribbean Islands,

259
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:54,606
they're surrounded by turquoise colour all around.

260
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:58,408
This area in the ocean stretches across a long distance 

261
00:11:58,408 --> 00:12:00,278
with shallow waters.

262
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:02,732
You can see the deep ocean around it

263
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:04,538
is represented in dark blue colour,

264
00:12:04,538 --> 00:12:08,044
and this area stands out when looked at through a satellite.

265
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:09,662
Because of this, it is said that

266
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,045
in the olden days, when the ships came to this area,

267
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:15,127
got stuck here due to shallow waters.

268
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:21,246
Hidden shoals were the points where the land beneath the ocean was quite high.

269
00:12:21,246 --> 00:12:23,213
But it was not visible from the ships.

270
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:25,356
When the ships were atop the area,

271
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:26,921
they would get stuck there.

272
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:28,125
The third peculiarity,

273
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,280
this area has one of the highest rates of hurricanes in the world.

274
00:12:31,572 --> 00:12:35,816
If you rank the countries where most of the hurricanes are seen, 

275
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:37,544
China is at Number 1,

276
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:40,128
then the USA at Number 2
followed by Cuba.

277
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:41,947
Cuba lies in this area.

278
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:45,377
And which state gets the most hurricanes in the USA?

279
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:46,754
Florida.

280
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:48,233
It lies in this area.

281
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:51,795
This area gets hurricanes and water sprouts more frequently. 

282
00:12:51,795 --> 00:12:54,784
Methane Hydrates is the fourth explanation.

283
00:12:54,784 --> 00:12:56,708
There are some areas in the ocean,

284
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,866
that have large fields of methane hydrates.

285
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:02,966
In Australia, scientists had conducted laboratory experiments

286
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:03,924
in which they had found that 

287
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,725
when there's an exceeding amount of methane bubbles in the water,

288
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:08,800
the density of the water gets lower,

289
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,348
and the buoyancy of a ship cannot be maintained,

290
00:13:12,348 --> 00:13:14,330
and so the ship drowns.

291
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,782
It's the same logic as when 

292
00:13:15,782 --> 00:13:17,719
the salt content of the water is high

293
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:18,952
the density of water increases,

294
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:21,967
and it becomes easier for things to float.

295
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,130
As is the case of the Dead Sea.

296
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,032
If you recall, I had made a vlog there.

297
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:27,353
A normal person who would sink into the ocean,

298
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:28,913
floats on the Dead Sea,

299
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:30,396
because the density of the water is high.

300
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:32,756
The same thing is happening here, in reverse.

301
00:13:32,756 --> 00:13:34,826
If there is methane in the water.

302
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:36,652
It is hypothesised,

303
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:38,609
if there are methane eruptions in the water,

304
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,438
they are also known as mud volcanoes,

305
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:44,665
when volcanoes erupt underwater,
methane is released

306
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:48,369
and if it happens when a ship is over the area, 

307
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,963
then the ship would instantly sink into the water,

308
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,254
without any warnings.

309
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:53,755
Never to be heard from again.

310
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:55,901
This is an interesting explanation,

311
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,576
But in all the disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle,

312
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,650
there was no direct evidence

313
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,053
that any exact incident was due to methane hydrates.

314
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:08,898
This is simply a scientifically proven thing that exists.

315
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,432
But to have actually caused the disappearance of any ship

316
00:14:12,432 --> 00:14:14,042
has not been proven yet.

317
00:14:14,042 --> 00:14:17,362
The fifth explanation is the most important, in my opinion.

318
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:19,908
Because this is related to human psychology.

319
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:21,752
This is known as the

320
00:14:21,752 --> 00:14:23,878
Baader-Meinhof Effect.

321
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:26,260
Or the Frequency Illusion.

322
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,476
The Baader-Meinhof Effect or the Frequency Illusion is a psychological effect.

323
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,050
It states that when we start to notice things more,

324
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,131
then we start finding them more often around us.

325
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:39,058
Remember when someone in your family bought a new car?

326
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:41,228
The model of the car you got,

327
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:43,487
after buying it, you would have noticed

328
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:46,080
that over the next few days or even months,

329
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,818
whenever you were on the road,

330
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:51,180
you started noticing the model of the car you bought more and more. 

331
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,351
You would notice the same model on the road.

332
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:58,526
You may also feel like more people bought the model after you bought it.

333
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:02,062
In reality, the frequency of the car on the road didn't change much.

334
00:15:02,062 --> 00:15:04,631
It was just as common after you bought it as it was before.

335
00:15:04,631 --> 00:15:06,426
But because you bought the car,

336
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:09,028
you started noticing it more.

337
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,834
The same thing is said about the Bermuda Triangle.

338
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:16,290
Though it is true that some big aircraft and vessels disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle,

339
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,124
But if you've noticed,

340
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:22,184
in many areas around the world across all oceans,

341
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:25,247
there have been such disappearances of aircraft and ships,

342
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:27,621
areas other than the Bermuda Triangle.

343
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:31,211
One of the recent examples of this is the Malaysian Airlines flight.

344
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:33,764
It hadn't disappeared around the Bermuda Triangle.

345
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:37,711
The thing is that when people came across the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle,

346
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:43,311
people started paying more attention to the disappearances and incidents there.

347
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:45,712
The incidents taking place around the Bermuda Triangle.

348
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,123
And the similar incidents that took place outside the Bermuda Triangle,

349
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,375
people didn't pay much attention to them.

350
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,151
Journalist Larry Kusche,

351
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:55,289
the author of the book 'The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Solved'

352
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,903
reached this solution too.

353
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:01,344
He wrote that though there were some incidents that took place initially,

354
00:16:01,344 --> 00:16:05,695
but when with time, when the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle gained prominence,

355
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:08,169
some people started creating their stories.

356
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:10,027
There was mystery-mongering,

357
00:16:10,027 --> 00:16:12,395
and some stories were totally absurd,

358
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:13,898
and hadn't really happened.

359
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:16,384
The story of Ellen Austin that I told you,

360
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:18,618
is said to be one such fabrication.

361
00:16:18,618 --> 00:16:22,112
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration of the US state that

362
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:26,736
there's no evidence that the aircraft and ships that disappear in the Bermuda Triangle,

363
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:30,683
the mysterious disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle that we see,

364
00:16:30,683 --> 00:16:33,423
no evidence that they occur more frequently in the Bermuda Triangle,

365
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:36,279
than compared to any other area of the ocean.

366
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:38,029
It is not so.

367
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:40,240
We see similar mysterious disappearances,

368
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,686
in the other areas of the oceans as well.

369
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:45,364
The United States Coast Guards have even said that

370
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:55,863
It shows that the Coast Guard of the USA don't even recognise

371
00:16:55,863 --> 00:16:58,703
the Bermuda Triangle is a hazardous area.

372
00:16:58,703 --> 00:17:01,593
They said that the fact "that the area within the Bermuda Triangle

373
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:02,804
is heavily trafficked,

374
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,422
could account for some of the mystery."

375
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:06,151
The area of the Bermuda Triangle,

376
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,579
sees a lot of traffic of ships and aeroplanes,

377
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:13,581
that's why the chances of such incidents happening here increase.

378
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:15,008
"Pair that with the fact that the

379
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:17,216
Bermuda Triangle is often swept by hurricanes,

380
00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:18,779
and the presence of the Gulf Stream,

381
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:20,941
it is not hard to see why ships might

382
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:22,616
occasionally sink there."

383
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:26,398
If you bear in mind that this area sees a lot of hurricanes,

384
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:28,279
and the water is shallow here,

385
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:32,521
you arrive at the straightforward answer to the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle.

386
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:34,680
But despite the frequent hurricanes,

387
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,355
when WWF had conducted their detailed study in 2013,

388
00:17:38,852 --> 00:17:42,751
for the World's 10 Most Dangerous Bodies of Water for Shipping,

389
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:45,284
in the top 10 most dangerous waters,

390
00:17:45,284 --> 00:17:46,960
the Bermuda Triangle area was not on the list.

391
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,324
Simply speaking,

392
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:52,060
the mysterious disappearances have nothing to do with the Bermuda Triangle.

393
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,032
You might ask now

394
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:59,163
what was the ball of fire that Christopher Columbus had seen fall into the ocean?

395
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,317
There's a simple and scientific answer to it too.

396
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:04,246
Scientists believe that it was actually a meteor

397
00:18:04,568 --> 00:18:06,598
seen by Christopher Columbus.
