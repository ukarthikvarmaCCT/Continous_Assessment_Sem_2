1
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,480
A battle is raging outside India

2
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,700
and soon it will be
fought in India.

3
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,520
You have to fight for your freedom,

4
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,630
nobody gives it to you.

5
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,550
We'll have to shed blood for
this freedom struggle.

6
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,400
Our blood.

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,990
The cost of our freedom
will be our blood.

8
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,660
Every story has a beginning and an end.

9
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,890
If you are born,
your death is inevitable.

10
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,460
Except few stories

11
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,820
which don't conclude at all.

12
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,350
The number of people who died...

13
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,700
is still yet to be confirmed.

14
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,810
It's been confirmed that
Subhash Chandra Bose...

15
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,790
Chief of the Indian National Army

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,150
and also a freedom fighter

17
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,280
has died in the plane crash.

18
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,740
It is a sad day for Japan also

19
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,110
because they've also lost a general
in the crash.

20
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,620
We'll be back with more information
on the crash as soon as we get it.

21
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,000
This story is about
Subhash Chandra Bose

22
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,950
whose death
gave birth to countless stories.

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,110
It's a telegram.

24
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,480
Bibhavati.

25
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,500
Gandhiji says we shouldn't perform
a post-death ritual for Netaji.

26
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,010
Subhash.

27
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,630
Is Subhash alive?

28
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,160
[Title Montage]

29
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,370
If Netaji is alive,
why doesn't he come out?

30
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,070
Who would want to see
his own funeral?

31
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,560
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's
childhood friend,

32
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,010
Hemant Sarkar.

33
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,670
He has only one dream.

34
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,800
To kick the British
and their government out of India.

35
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,370
So that people like you and me

36
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,250
can breathe in free India.

37
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,040
Do you think it's the first time

38
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,350
that Subhash has disappeared?

39
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,890
Karna accepted Parshuram as his guru

40
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:23,620
but, Parshuram didn't know that Karna
was a kshatriya, not a Brahmin.

41
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,720
I curse you.

42
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,890
-Sire...
-During the war,

43
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,080
you won't be able to use your knowledge.

44
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,780
-My dear nephew...
-Yes, uncle.

45
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,490
It's our only chance
to finish off the Pandavas.

46
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,040
Uncle, your wish shall come true.

47
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,910
Duryodhan!

48
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,170
Grandsire!

49
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,180
You bunked school to watch a play.

50
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,410
God, I've been looking for you
since morning.

51
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,660
Now answer me.

52
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,790
Father, I think...

53
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,840
-I shouldn't go to school.
-Why not?

54
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,420
From tomorrow, you'll go to school
and come back home straight.

55
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,930
You won't step out of the house
without my permission.

56
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,470
Understood?

57
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,810
You can leave.

58
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,960
Subhash.

59
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,530
Eat something before you sleep.

60
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,140
All right.

61
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,290
Boys of his age

62
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,500
crave for sweets.

63
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,480
They want to see fairs.

64
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,530
But...

65
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,080
what's with Subhash?

66
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,560
Subhash, why did we run away from home?

67
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,980
Because we are free now.

68
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,410
And what will we do with this freedom?

69
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,330
We'll do whatever we want!

70
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,630
What if we make mistakes?

71
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,930
Only humans are fortunate enough
to make mistakes.

72
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,610
Look at those cattle,
do they make any mistakes?

73
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,980
No, right?

74
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,370
It's up to you. Do you want to
live like humans

75
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,680
or meander like cattle?

76
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,680
Come on.

77
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,270
"This is my destiny."

78
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,830
"To be free! Be free!"

79
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,500
"This is my destiny."

80
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,150
[Mr.Janki] Rein in him now or cry later.

81
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,840
Well, I'm crying now.

82
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,160
[Rahman] Subhash came back home after seven months.

83
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,570
Back then, Subhash was only 14

84
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,100
and yet he stayed hidden
from his parents for seven months.

85
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,610
Can't a 48-year-old man stay hidden
from the British government?

86
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,230
Bose is alive and...

87
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,050
he'll be back soon.

88
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,980
There's neither a dead body nor a photo.

89
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,980
Why should we believe that Netaji
died in the plane crash?

90
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,180
[Speaker] Netaji has tricked the British government.

91
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,620
[Speaker] He's just biding his time
to strike the British Raj

92
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,020
[Speaker] and blow it to smithereens.

93
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,830
Long live the revolution!

94
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,580
[Speaker] Free India!

95
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,650
[Stanley] 25th August, 1945.

96
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,790
The world thinks that Bose is dead.

97
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,640
Because Bose wants the world
to think that he's dead.

98
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,070
He's alive.

99
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,430
And we should be worried.

100
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,870
He's dead, Stanley!
Everyone says he's dead.

101
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,390
You can get over this now!

102
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,930
There's a rumour that says
he faked his own death!

103
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,770
What if it's true?

104
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,940
We have guests here
and they are waiting for you.

105
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,380
What if it's an error in judgement
on my part again?

106
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,200
You can let go of all this.

107
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,770
Bose is dead!
Give your obsession a decent burial!

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,660
I'll be there in five minutes.

109
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,950
You can cage me, but you cannot
suppress my voice!

110
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,700
Mr. Bose is alive
and he will be back.

111
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,550
No food or water for him today.

112
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,110
Long live Mr. Bose!

113
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,950
Long live Mr. Bose!

114
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,870
No matter what rumours they spread,

115
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,200
the whole country knows the truth.
Netaji is alive.

116
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,380
Netaji has contributed greatly
to the Indian freedom struggle

117
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,930
and even our children know that.

118
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,670
Netaji's demise has sent
shockwaves throughout India.

119
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,400
Netaji is immortal.

120
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,700
One has to die first
to become immortal.

121
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,800
Netaji is alive.

122
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,530
How do you know that?

123
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,750
Just like you know.

124
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,580
Dear...

125
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,940
[Man] God makes everything in pairs.

126
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,350
Like man and woman,
cigarettes and matchsticks!

127
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,470
There's another fellow
who is as crazy as you are.

128
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,210
Even he believes that Netaji is alive.

129
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,130
[Darbari Lal] I say, the British are playing us.
Netaji is alive and will be back soon.

130
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,270
Stop harping about Netaji!
When will he be back?

131
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,060
What a wretched man!

132
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,100
He only talks about one thing.

133
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,740
-Look here.
-Yes.

134
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,290
I fought with him in Burma.

135
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,860
I know Netaji is alive.

136
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,430
But where is he?

137
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,140
-Have you met him after Burma?
-No.

138
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,420
So how do you know he's alive?

139
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,590
Because I know there was no plane crash.

140
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,860
You say there was no plane crash,
but people are saying it happened.

141
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,670
There was no plane crash!

142
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,420
Because no plane flew that day.

143
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,890
-I see, the plane didn't take off.
-Yes.

144
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,290
Where did you find this moron?

145
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,170
Ram Singh.

146
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,410
Open the door.

147
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,020
For a few more days,
I mingled with the prisoners

148
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,110
and tried to find out
if Bose was alive or dead.

149
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,030
But I couldn't find out anything.

150
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,170
Perhaps, nobody wanted to
tell me anything.

151
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,040
Sir, I'm telling you
it's all in your mind.

152
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,330
Were you really convincing
with the prisoners?

153
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,430
If they were hiding something,
would they have shared it with you?

154
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,900
Everyone spoke their heart out.

155
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,260
I know about their kids, their wives,
about their families...

156
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,190
They even shared intimate details
about their wives.

157
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,170
But they know nothing about Mr. Bose.

158
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,400
Why do you think Mr. Bose is still alive?

159
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,360
Because I know it.

160
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,690
It has been 27 years

161
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,110
but Stanley continues to be
obsessed with Subhash Chandra Bose.

162
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,780
I still remember 1918

163
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,390
when I confronted Mr. Bose
for the first time

164
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,140
in Presidency College.

165
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,510
What is that?

166
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,060
Are you cheating?

167
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,940
No, sir. That's Gayatri mantra.

168
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,980
Oh, yes.

169
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,440
We try and we try and we try
to rid you of your superstitions.

170
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,740
But we fail, every single time.

171
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,130
Sir, please don't do that.

172
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,350
You'll are beastly people
with a beastly religion.

173
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,370
And I shall have none of this
frigging nonsense in my classroom!

174
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,170
If any of you

175
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,600
is carrying a totem
which you mistakenly believe

176
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,150
would call upon some deity in the sky
to swoop down

177
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,760
and assist you in passing my examination.
I assure you, it'll not.

178
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,150
Take your totem and place it in this box.

179
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,450
Now!

180
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,500
Hurry up!

181
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,020
Please understand
there's no real power...

182
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,260
attached to any of these objects.

183
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,990
Except that which you,
yourself give it.

184
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,900
Sir...

185
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,940
Yes?

186
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,190
I find your idea quite liberating.

187
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,250
Nice.

188
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,500
So, if I don't attach any power to your
position as a professor or teacher...

189
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,100
then I'm free to do something
which I wanted to do

190
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,920
since the day I joined your class?

191
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,920
What is that?

192
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,890
"It's difficult to understand Subhash."

193
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,740
"It's difficult to understand Subhash."

194
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,690
"Difficult to understand."

195
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,740
"It's difficult to understand Subhash."

196
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,480
"Weapons is the only answer."

197
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,410
"Conversations don't bring about change!"

198
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,270
"The enemy intimidates with torture."

199
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,320
"But carefree, we shout Long Live India!"

200
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,300
"Bose!"

201
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,240
"Fought for freedom, fought injustice!
He looked the British in the eye."

202
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,180
"Bose!"

203
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,020
"A mysterious man, not easily nabbed!
A genius, when it comes to results."

204
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,980
"Bose!"

205
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,900
"Killed in a plane crash, says history
but his death remains a mystery!"

206
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,260
"Bose!"

207
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,080
"His death remains a mystery."

208
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,440
"His death remains a mystery."

209
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,340
"The call for freedom
from millions of voices."

210
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,490
"Look straight into
the eyes of the enemy."

211
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,130
"A story from Tokyo to Rangoon."

212
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,170
"A steadfast mind makes a man get up."

213
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,210
"Get up, stand up."

214
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,160
"Freedom knows the need of now."

215
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,400
"He demands a new time,
the keys of independence."

216
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,620
"He is a revolution, he needed a revolt."

217
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,410
"And revolution needs blood."

218
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,550
"In uncertain times,
in a nation that's confused"

219
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,290
"It's difficult to understand Subhash."

220
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,240
"Bose!"

221
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,160
"Fought for freedom, fought injustice!
He looked the British in the eye."

222
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,340
"Bose!"

223
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,750
This is a very dangerous precedent.

224
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,650
We need to have Subhash arrested.

225
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,040
If we don't take strong action now,

226
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,840
we can have a student rebellion
on our hands.

227
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,540
Hold on a minute. What's my fault?

228
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,330
-You attacked a Britisher.
-So what?

229
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,580
Is it a sin?

230
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,500
I'll take you to the professor now
and your patriotic fervour will die down.

231
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,430
We're equal in the professor's eyes.

232
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,130
Slaves. He won't be able to
recognize me.

233
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,560
Move it.

234
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,130
Professor Otton's honor
was crushed to bits

235
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,710
and along with it the notion

236
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:59,400
that an Indian will turn the other cheek
if slapped once.

237
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,890
This time the cheek was that of
a British!

238
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,970
And the one who slapped was an Indian.

239
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,960
-Cigarettes?
-Keep it inside.

240
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,950
But, Stanley, you have to charge him.

241
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,010
Yes, but for that, Professor Otton
needs to press charges.

242
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,850
Professor?

243
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,690
I wouldn't like to file a complaint.

244
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,990
I don't want people to talk about it.
Do you understand?

245
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,900
Hail Subhash Chandra Bose!

246
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,640
Hail Subhash Chandra Bose!

247
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,400
Hail Subhash Chandra Bose!

248
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,420
Hail Subhash Chandra Bose!

249
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,050
Hail Subhash Chandra Bose!

250
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,960
Hail Subhash Chandra Bose!

251
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,790
Wait! Put him down.

252
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,220
I'm asking you to put him down!

253
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,740
Sir, you should have been there.
Subhash has avenged our insults.

254
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,240
He has been rusticated
for his behaviour!

255
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,910
Father, history has taught us
that freedom is not given.

256
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,740
-It is taken.
-That's right!

257
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,220
Okay, calm down.

258
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,740
Hail Subhash Chandra Bose!

259
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,010
The transformation from Subhash to Bose
and from Bose to Netaji

260
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,620
was still years away.

261
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,470
But that day, Stanley saw a glimpse.

262
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,620
A glimpse that struck
fear in his heart.

263
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,360
Who are you?

264
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,390
What are you doing in my house?

265
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,190
I don't understand.

266
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,580
These are my personal letters,
you can't just come to my house...

267
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,020
When did he send those letters?

268
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,720
Are there any more letters from him?

269
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,850
These letters are sent from
Singapore, Burma.

270
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,340
Are there more letters or this is it?

271
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,600
How did you enter my house?

272
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,960
-You are not allowed to...
-Are there any more letters from him?

273
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,770
If Bose communicated with anyone,
it would be his wife.

274
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,270
Do you know where Bose is?

275
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,170
Did you speak with Bose
after the 21st of August?

276
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,900
What?

277
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,490
How dare you ask me that!

278
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,400
Bose passed away on 19th August
in a plane crash!

279
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,380
Are you saying that he is alive?

280
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,020
Are there more letters or just these?

281
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,840
Look at you!

282
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,290
Aren't you ashamed to betray
your own country?

283
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,330
Tell me, what do you know?

284
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,290
Is he alive? Is he coming back?

285
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,720
Tell me, what do you know?

286
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,170
-Please...
-What's wrong, Emilie?

287
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,950
Mom, stay there.

288
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,480
Either you tell me what you know
or leave now.

289
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,820
Get out of here!

290
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,820
Emilie, turn the radio on.
There is news about Bose.

291
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,360
According to the Japanese government

292
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,650
there is no mention
of Subhash Chandra Bose

293
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,350
in the list of those who died
in the plane crash.

294
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,130
-Hello.
-[Emilie] Hello, this is Emilie.

295
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,970
Emilie, listen, Subhash is safe.

296
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,610
This is not the first time
he's just disappeared like this.

297
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,020
In German papers, there is no name
on the passengers' list.

298
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,860
So he's definitely alive.

299
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,540
You need to know that
he spoke of some people in India

300
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,350
-who wanted to hurt him.
-Yes.

301
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,270
I know, I know.
I will call you back, Emilie.

302
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,760
Take care.

303
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,810
I think, we have our lead.

304
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,150
It's been three months, Emilie.

305
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,660
You really trust him to come back?

306
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,080
He's done that before.
So why not do it again?

307
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,400
They hated you for marrying him.

308
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,420
You know, you're not safe here, Emilie.

309
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,890
You're delusional, he's not coming back.

310
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,570
Sorry for the interruption.

311
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,770
Standby for an important broadcast.

312
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,590
INA leader, Subhash Chandra Bose
wants to read out a message for you.

313
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,810
Dear Emilie,

314
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,180
So many have loved me before you.

315
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,950
But, I've never looked at them.

316
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,030
You got that? Now show me.

317
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,180
Got it? Show me how to do it.

318
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,050
Sister, it is a fish fork.

319
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,100
Kindly, use the fruit fork.

320
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,760
I know the difference between

321
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,410
-a fish and fruit fork.
-Hello.

322
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,830
Mother, listen...

323
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,900
[Kalandi] The Prince of Wales is
coming to Calcutta.

324
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,840
He has invited a chosen few
for tea and snacks.

325
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,600
He's also invited Nandini.

326
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,440
-Congratulations.
-[Kalandi] Thank you.

327
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,300
They need Indians
only for decorative purposes.

328
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,510
We are Indians who...

329
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,950
Nandini, come on.

330
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,500
[Nandini] Greetings!

331
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,690
[Kalandi] We've sent Nandini to the best finishing
school in Britain.

332
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,210
She speaks English like the British.

333
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,520
Subhash, you can take Nandini to the
terrace and show her kites.

334
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,840
That's the way, right?

335
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,210
Nandini can see the kites without
going upstairs.

336
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,440
How can you send her with a boy...

337
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,960
-It's nothing like that.
-Mother...

338
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,890
I trust Subhash completely.

339
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,810
[Kalandi] You guys can go. Go.

340
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,610
1921, Calcutta.

341
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,800
Bose had cleared
the Indian Civil Services examination.

342
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,480
The kite season was upon us.

343
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,670
The kids were busy chasing kites

344
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,100
while all mothers wanted
to steal the best groom!

345
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,330
I'll be right back.

346
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,510
Subhash was a high-flying kite.

347
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,660
[Subhash] The black kite, the blue
and that's the green kite.

348
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,320
Done? Let's go.

349
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,230
Subhash, help me out here, please?

350
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,990
ICS!

351
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,350
Thank you.

352
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,000
You've researched about me
before meeting me.

353
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,930
My mother checked you out, not me.

354
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,570
Your mother's research is incomplete.

355
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,140
Why?

356
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,410
I've quit my job.

357
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,650
-Sarat.
-Yes, mother.

358
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,530
I get restless when someone comes
with their daughter.

359
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,400
I need your help. You should
have a classified in your paper.

360
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,440
-I don't like to say it all the time.
-What?

361
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,020
That Subhash stood 4th
in the Indian Civil Services.

362
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,730
He then quit that job
and came back to India.

363
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,770
Print anything you like.

364
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,820
Kids are scared of big cats

365
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,040
and girls from Beni Ghat
are scared of me.

366
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,290
You should go downstairs.

367
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,500
If I go downstairs,
they'll send me up again.

368
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Why did you quit your job?

369
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,350
Because I am free to do it.

370
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,130
What makes the British so special
that they're free in this world?

371
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,460
We are slaves in our homeland.

372
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,600
Some people are slaves, not me.

373
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,470
I am free to play
and to do whatever I want.

374
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,920
I can fly kites too.

375
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,130
That's what you think.

376
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,010
Care for a smoke?

377
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,450
No, thank you.

378
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,520
Aren't you free to smoke?

379
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,310
Freedom is only for men,
not for women.

380
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,830
Freedom is everyone's right.

381
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,070
But do women want to be free?

382
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,780
Subhash has resigned!

383
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,190
Yes, Kalandi, I just told you.

384
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,630
But, you don't want to believe it.

385
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,910
But, you should have at least
told me before.

386
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,540
Did you tell me you were coming
with a marriage proposal?

387
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,950
-[Kalandi] Nandini!
-Here.

388
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,240
Mother. Thank you.

389
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,990
What did you do to my daughter?

390
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,100
-She wanted to smoke.
-And you let her!

391
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,820
-Mom...
-Shut up!

392
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,000
Do you smoke?

393
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,590
-Subhash.
-Just shut up.

394
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,250
Prince of Wales is coming to Calcutta,
I'll see you there.

395
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,480
I will see you there, Subhash.

396
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,650
I will see you, too.

397
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,990
-Let's go.
-I will see you there, Subhash.

398
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,780
-Let's go.
-Mom, what are you doing?

399
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,910
-Nandini!
-Subhash.

400
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,710
[Mr.Janki] How many times will you
embarrass us?

401
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,940
Okay, the kite incident.

402
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,450
I don't know, dad.

403
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,450
The women who come with marriage proposals
are stubborn, they don't give up!

404
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,550
You think it's a joke?

405
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,890
[Mr.Janki] Do you even realize
what you have done?

406
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,090
I probably shattered the dreams of the
damsels of Calcutta to become my wife.

407
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,740
It was a prestigious job.

408
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,470
Father, it was slavery!
I would've been reduced to a slave.

409
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,200
Really?

410
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,370
So what are you now?

411
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,680
A revolutionary.

412
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,760
There's only one difference between
a slave and a revolutionary.

413
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,090
Intentions.

414
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,200
A slave intends to serve,
without any purpose.

415
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,590
While a revolutionary intends
to be a soldier.

416
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,220
-So what are you?
-Revolutionaries!

417
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,330
Darbari Lal, keep an eye out
for anything suspicious.

418
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,460
We don't know what Gandhi is planning.

419
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,710
Gandhiji has asked us to boycott
foreign products.

420
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,190
Gandhiji was talking something
about boycott.

421
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,330
But it's nothing new and
it isn't happening for the first time.

422
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,890
This time, we'll not only boycott
foreign products,

423
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,850
but we'll also sell our products
to the British.

424
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,990
A prince is coming to India.

425
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,370
We shouldn't let him leave
empty-handed.

426
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,410
That won't look good.

427
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,810
Go and spread the word.

428
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,130
Stop!

429
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,750
What's in the bale?

430
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,660
Clothes.

431
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,080
Where are you taking it?

432
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,190
Prince of Wales is here.
We want to sell him khadi.

433
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,430
Do you think Prince of Wales
would wear your clothes?

434
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,330
-What is this?
-Bring them here.

435
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,520
Give it to me.

436
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,980
Prince of Wales will trade with you?

437
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,970
-Open and check, both of them.
-We are forced to buy what he sells.

438
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,310
If he buys our khadi
it won't kill him.

439
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,750
-Open it and check.
-We won't charge him much.

440
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,450
He should buy it just to honour
the 250 million Indians he rules.

441
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,780
-Prince of Wales, Prince...
-Mr. Bose...

442
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,580
[Subhash] It's just Khadi.

443
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,220
You've come to sell khadi?

444
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,350
To the Prince of Wales?

445
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,950
Yes, it's called trade.

446
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,820
Arrest him.

447
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,240
-Take them to the police station.
-Prince of Wales...

448
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,370
-Take him.
-Prince of Wales...

449
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,670
-Keep moving...
-Where?

450
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,610
You've been robbing us for years,
buy some of our khadi.

451
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,350
-Nandini.
-Subhash.

452
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,070
They didn't let us meet
His Royal Highness.

453
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,520
-But you can meet him...
-Move it.

454
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,720
-Subhash.
-Take them.

455
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,090
-Prince...
-Move it.

456
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,010
-Hello, Mrs. Winterbuttle.
-Hello.

457
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,810
-I hope you're having a good time.
-See you soon.

458
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,850
See you later.

459
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,950
Oh, thank you so much.

460
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,260
-I hope you enjoy your stay.
-Thank you.

461
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,020
-Come.
-Excuse me.

462
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,010
Hello.

463
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,310
Nice to meet you.

464
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,660
Oh.

465
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,670
That is going to be 50 rupees,
Your Highness.

466
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,060
Excuse me.

467
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,660
50 rupees? For what?

468
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,510
That is the price of our khadi.

469
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,690
For all the cloth that you have been
dumping on us from England.

470
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,900
Nandini...

471
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,430
-Welcome to India.
-Let's go.

472
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,740
-Welcome to India!
-[Prince] Excuse me.

473
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,910
-[Man] What is this?
-[Prince] This woman misbehaved.

474
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,320
Your daughter won't emulate
the British anymore.

475
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,770
You wasted your time
on fish forks, fruit forks...

476
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,370
Finishing school.

477
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,240
[Kalandi] Mr. Janki, your son, Subhash...

478
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,390
He's a disease.

479
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,370
My daughter wouldn't have acted so rashly
before meeting your son.

480
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,850
-He has brainwashed everyone.
-Mother, calm down.

481
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,910
Keep quiet!

482
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,040
Nandini is the only woman in Calcutta

483
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,090
who has shown the courage to sell khadi
to the Prince of Wales.

484
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,160
You should be proud of her.

485
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,080
Keep quiet.

486
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,890
This is just the start, Subhash.

487
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,230
[Judge] Silajit Sengupta.

488
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,940
[Judge] Satyajit Ghosh.

489
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,980
Himadri Chakraborty.

490
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,300
-Adhiraj Bandopade...
-Bandopadhyay.

491
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,800
Shivprasad Mukopady.

492
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,680
Subhash Chandra Bose.

493
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,150
Having been found guilty by us,

494
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,370
of offences under section 294
and section 268

495
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,280
of the Indian Penal Code

496
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,210
for trying to sell khadi
to the Prince of Wales.

497
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,200
are hereby sentenced to six-month
imprisonment.

498
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,660
Six months, that's it.

499
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,500
Did we steal a chicken?

500
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,520
[Judge] Order, order in the court.

501
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,300
Are we being punished for
stealing a fowl?

502
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,820
Or maybe we should beat up
one of your officers

503
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,950
so that you can increase our imprisonment.

504
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,210
[Judge] The accused will maintain decorum
in this courtroom.

505
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,390
The police may proceed.

506
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,070
Yes, milord.

507
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,130
Opium?

508
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,580
Cocaine?

509
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,670
No.

510
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,110
Gandhi?

511
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,490
Gandhiji.

512
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,880
People were sent to prison for
smuggling cocaine and opium.

513
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,430
Nowadays they go to jail
for following Gandhi.

514
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,410
You collaborate with the British
and throw your countrymen in prison.

515
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,630
Do you enjoy doing it?

516
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,760
Don't you feel like joining Gandhiji

517
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,270
and contributing to the freedom struggle?

518
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,380
You're a scheming man, Mr. Bose.

519
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,990
Are you implying that
Gandhiji's ideas are scheming?

520
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,550
What did Gandhiji do?

521
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,240
He only demanded a boycott,

522
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,620
but you jumped a step ahead
to sell khadi.

523
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,620
Right?

524
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,020
Nobody was ready to buy from me.

525
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,140
You serve a bunch of beggars

526
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,870
and yet you slave for them.

527
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,770
Mr. Bose, there are
so many prisoners here.

528
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,160
They do time for six months
quite peacefully

529
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,180
and outside the prison too.

530
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,670
They get married and
fight for the freedom struggle.

531
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,330
But you're obsessed...
obsessed with your motherland!

532
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,640
[Stanley] You will be released tomorrow.
12 Noon.

533
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,190
Pack your belongings and be ready.

534
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,690
Darbari, if your boss ever needs khadi,
let me know.

535
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,550
We have enough clothes.

536
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,070
Ask him to buy some
for the sake of his destitute government.

537
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,400
They've been living off us
for quite a while now.

538
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,320
Don't think you'll get away
with this, Bose.

539
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,310
I always get away, Mr. Stanley.

540
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,790
[Stanley] Bose got away.

541
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,510
The Japanese press has not
one mention of the crash.

542
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,900
A plane crashes and not one
mention of it?

543
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,670
Are you quite sure,
you're not obsessed with him?

544
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,920
Why would he stage his own death?

545
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,510
Sir, I know him.

546
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,870
I've watched him from close quarters.

547
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,740
He plays everything like a game of chess.

548
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,480
While, you're busy saving your queen,

549
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,400
he's already attacked your king and
before you know it, checkmate.

550
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,230
Do not contribute

551
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,830
to the hysteria,
which is already out there.

552
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,720
[Man] Checkmate!

553
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,060
"You raised an army in the forest."

554
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,030
"You wrote this incredible tale."

555
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
"You designed a rebellion."

556
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,320
"No, no you never died."

557
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,210
"You never lost your resilience."

558
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,310
"You woke and shook the nation."

559
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,150
"You taught us
the meaning of the country."

560
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,070
"And vanished into immortality."

561
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,750
"But my blood still boils."

562
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,930
"No, I am not satiated."

563
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,910
"History is cursed."

564
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,820
"Your secret, secret story."

565
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,550
"In a nation that sleeps."

566
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,380
"Is difficult to understand."

567
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,340
"It's difficult to understand Subhash."

568
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,160
"In times like these..."

569
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,650
Mr. Nehru, I have a reliable source

570
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,220
who tells me, he saw Subhash Chandra Bose
in Saigon

571
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,040
11 days after his supposed demise.

572
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,540
What do you have to say about that?

573
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,970
I have no comments on that.

574
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,970
No more questions, please.

575
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,400
Bose was alive.

576
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,150
Or it's possible that
the faith of thousands of people

577
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,450
kept him alive, making him immortal.

578
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,690
Emilie. Your call.

579
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,540
Operator speaking.

580
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,600
Yes, sir, I'm connecting you
to the line two.

581
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,950
Thank you.

582
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,280
Ever since she heard
the radio announcement

583
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,920
Emilie would always be lost,
thinking about the radio.

584
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,420
She always hoped to hear
Bose's voices.

585
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,250
After 165 letters,

586
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,640
nine years and bidding goodbyes
eight times,

587
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,380
Emilie was getting used to
the life of waiting for Bose.

588
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,120
Who switched off the radio?

589
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,800
Bose's death sparked so many questions

590
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:39,060
which not only troubled Emilie
but also Stanley.

591
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,140
On one hand,
there was Bose's ladylove

592
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,150
and on the other,
there was a British officer.

593
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,580
Both had one thing in common.

594
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,560
Both of them were convinced
that Bose would return.

595
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,390
They were all looking for the link
which could help them find Bose.

596
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,290
[Man] They know about you.

597
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,790
You will have to leave this place.

598
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,930
It was unbelievable that in the airplane
crash that killed Bose...

599
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,370
two of Bose's fellow passengers,

600
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,070
an INA Officer Rahman and a Japanese
Officer Nakamura escaped unscathed.

601
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,480
In fact, Bose's confidant Ayar too

602
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,320
was unable to believe
that Bose was no more.

603
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:19,320
I'm telling the truth, Ayar,
Netaji's upper body was badly burnt.

604
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,510
Rahman, forget what I think,

605
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,460
no one in India, would believe

606
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,050
that Netaji's no more.

607
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,760
Bose's upper body was badly burnt.

608
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,390
I used my coat to put out the fire.

609
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,610
Everyone had their own versions
about the fateful plane crash.

610
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,420
But in the end, all the stories reached
one conclusion: Bose's death.

611
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,960
Can we...

612
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,460
fly down Netaji's body to Singapore?

613
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,210
The size of the coffin...

614
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,250
won't fit in the aircraft.

615
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,620
None of us have seen his dead body.

616
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,160
You performed his last rites
without informing us.

617
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,730
Why the rush?

618
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,960
So then we can transport
his body by ship.

619
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,080
That won't be possible.

620
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:28,200
The body is in such a bad condition,
it could start decaying any moment.

621
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,180
And the chemicals required
to preserve the body...

622
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,750
are not available in Formosa.

623
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,950
Okay. I believe you for the moment
that you're telling the truth.

624
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,820
But at least a photograph.

625
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,680
You don't even have a single photo
for his family?

626
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,690
Take the photographs.

627
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,240
Don't take photographs of the face.

628
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,840
You couldn't preserve the body
because chemicals weren't available.

629
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,420
Also, you performed
the last rites in a rush.

630
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:04,650
You couldn't take a photo of his face
as it was badly burnt.

631
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,870
Do you seriously expect me
to believe that?

632
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,290
What is that you're not telling us?

633
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,680
[Stanley] What are they not telling us?

634
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,760
It's a British contingent

635
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,140
on its way to Taiwan

636
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,890
to look for Bose!

637
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,310
Where are you, Bose?

638
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,550
Where the hell are you?

639
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,740
Bose has just been released.

640
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,930
We can relax for a couple of days.

641
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,730
-I mean, he will relax for few days.
-He's a loose cannon.

642
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,820
Even Gandhi can't control him.

643
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,690
Put all eyes on him.

644
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,980
Yes, sir.

645
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,860
[Stanley] Darbari Lal!

646
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,120
Yes, sir.

647
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,510
The British government's police
intelligence had sent

648
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,260
many of their spies behind Bose.

649
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,040
They were waiting for something
big to happen.

650
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,310
[Subhash] Faster.

651
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,900
Use both hands. Wait.

652
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,030
Come here. Look ahead.

653
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,630
Okay.

654
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,500
Maintain distance.

655
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,750
Make sure you don't hit each other,
we have to hit the Brits!

656
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:36,980
Hey!

657
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,180
Strike up, down.

658
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,510
On the head and then block!

659
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,620
All right! Let's begin.

660
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,390
Sir, he's teaching them
to fight with sticks.

661
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,430
And you're sure it's only sticks?

662
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,970
[Stanley] There are no guns involved...

663
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,160
They had sticks, right?
No guns or weapons?

664
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,720
No, sir, but it's confirmed.

665
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,660
Bose has nothing to do with non-violence!

666
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,570
He's building an army!

667
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,920
An army with sticks as weapons?

668
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,480
[Man] Sir, one more thing.

669
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:10,310
he had organized a camp for the people
affected by the flood.

670
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,550
A whole group of spies were
tailing Bose.

671
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,340
Bose was a law-abiding
and a model citizen.

672
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,060
Stanley was frustrated after
what his spies were telling him.

673
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,400
Sir, it's confirmed!

674
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,850
Bose is about to marry the Congress leader
Kiran Shankar Roy's sister.

675
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,650
[Man] I have also found out

676
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,100
[Man] that Kiran Shankar Roy will send Bose
to England after his marriage

677
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,770
[Man] to study law.

678
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,760
Mr. Bose has resigned from
civil services.

679
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,960
Why would he go to London to study law?

680
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,270
[Darbari Lal] You're talking nonsense.

681
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,170
-You wasted his time. Now leave.
-[Man] Okay, sir.

682
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,190
Put more men on him, Darbari Lal.

683
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,610
I need good men!

684
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,670
In fact, I want you to be his shadow.

685
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,310
Sir, me?

686
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,500
What information can I extract
that these spies couldn't?

687
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:13,500
You have an edge over them.
You know him.

688
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,540
If I knew Mr. Bose,

689
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,660
he also knew me very well.

690
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,640
-[Child] Where do I go?
-[Subhash] Right here!

691
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:47,020
-[Subhash] Good, keep it up!
-[Child] Be alert.

692
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,020
-[Child] Come here.
-Here!

693
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,820
-I am here.
-Right here.

694
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,630
[Child] Come here!

695
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,090
Hey, where are you going? Come here!

696
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,470
-A cup of tea, please!
-Sure.

697
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,840
I'll be right back!

698
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,820
Excuse me, my money?

699
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,700
-Aunt!
-Subhash.

700
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,410
-How are you?
-I'm fine, how are you?

701
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,560
I'm good.

702
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,690
It's raining heavily.
Where are you coming from?

703
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,030
From home.

704
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,930
What are you looking at?

705
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,090
Who is it?

706
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,040
He spies for the British.

707
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,170
[Aunt] So what is he doing here?

708
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,150
As if you're starting a movement
right here!

709
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,560
-How about some tea?
-Sure.

710
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,130
I'll get it for you.

711
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:33,290
Darbari, Darbari, come here.

712
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,200
Come here.

713
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,740
Here.

714
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,420
-No, I'm fine here.
-Take it. It's raining.

715
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,500
Thank you, Mr. Bose.

716
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,430
Have some tea.

717
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,070
-No...
-Drink it while it's hot.

718
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,310
Care for a smoke?

719
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,120
No.

720
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,780
Take it, I won't tell Stanley.

721
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,380
No, thank you.

722
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,160
So what did you find out about me?

723
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,050
Mr. Bose, you're very stubborn!

724
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,590
You'll again create problems
for the British.

725
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,540
Will you tell this to Stanley?

726
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,280
He'll realize it.

727
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,520
-You are very...
-Intelligent, I know.

728
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,930
Listen, go home.
It is raining, you'll catch a cold.

729
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,980
Take this umbrella with you.

730
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,560
Bring it back when you spy on me tomorrow.

731
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,610
Okay, I'll leave right now.

732
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,620
And listen...

733
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,140
a spy should always do the job
from a distance.

734
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:48,760
Go now.

735
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,480
Mr. Bose was a master of disguise,
he could vanish in a blink of an eye!

736
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:59,240
We followed Mr. Bose for months,

737
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,570
but we couldn't find anything.

738
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,570
-Go home, pal!
-Sure.

739
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,240
-Go home!
-Whatever Bose was planning behind doors

740
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,370
was about to change everything.

741
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,960
[Subhash] I am coming!

742
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,040
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

743
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,910
Here's your parcel.
Can you sign here?

744
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,520
Done?

745
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,060
-Do you want water?
-No, sir.

746
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:35,360
See you.

747
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,880
-Hey, postman!
-Yes.

748
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:46,580
-What were you doing inside?
-Delivering a parcel.

749
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:49,620
-A parcel for?
-For Mr. Subhash.

750
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,530
Oh, Mr. Subhash.
Let me see.

751
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:59,940
Okay, great. Can I keep this?

752
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,990
-What do you mean?
-You may leave.

753
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,770
-All right, off you go.
-What a nuisance!

754
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:11,120
Darbari Lal says a uniform
got delivered to Bose's house.

755
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,710
Apparently, it was a GOC's uniform

756
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,080
that was mistakenly delivered
to Fort Williams.

757
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,980
The officers at Fort Williams
had quite a laugh about it.

758
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,890
It was an army uniform.

759
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,320
Doesn't that bother you?

760
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,330
Maybe Bose likes to dress up!
Who knows?

761
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,540
[Darbari Lal] Sir, even I feel the same.

762
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:33,100
Mr. Bose always tries to spite us.

763
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,160
[Darbari Lal] It was just one uniform.

764
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,410
It's not a big issue.

765
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:46,620
No one knew why Bose ordered
khaki uniforms.

766
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,850
Before anyone could find the answer,

767
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:54,500
in 1928 the streets of Calcutta
witnessed the unthinkable.

768
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,210
Mr. Bose was marching on the street
with two thousand people.

769
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:01,720
The British and the Congress government
were reduced to mute spectators.

770
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:08,070
-Your Excellency, had we known...
-Nonsense!

771
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,790
How could you have not known two thousand
people would descend upon our city

772
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,710
wearing uniforms and carrying weapons?

773
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,930
That chap Bose has made
a perfect arse out of us!

774
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,510
You have got to get a grip on things.

775
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,260
[Stanley] Do you know you're a traitor
to the empire?

776
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,490
But he gave me money. I made him clothes.

777
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,610
It was not just clothes but uniforms.

778
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,330
You have raised a standing army
against the British Raj!

779
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,920
But, I was just trying to make...

780
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,300
[Stanley] Some Indian comes and gives you money,
you make him uniforms!

781
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:41,370
-I was, I was...
-To fight against your own people!

782
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,040
Do you have any idea
how much trouble are we in?

783
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:47,030
I'll make sure that you never
do business in this city again.

784
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,280
-But, please listen...
-Shut up!

785
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,060
You didn't tell anyone about this.

786
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,750
What should I say?

787
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,350
We Indians should have our own army!

788
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:00,300
-[Man] Pratik, say something.
-It's my country, my people...

789
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,190
why should I inform or ask anyone?

790
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:05,440
Subhash, weapons and chaos are against
our rules!

791
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,860
Who made the rules anyway?

792
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,580
And what have we achieved
with these rules?

793
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,100
Do you know the real reason
behind our slavery?

794
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,170
It's your thinking and nonviolence.

795
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,400
What do you want to do, Subhash?

796
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:19,490
We are talking with
the British government.

797
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,520
For years, we've been talking,
but have we achieved freedom?

798
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,420
But this might scare them.

799
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,920
That's good.

800
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,640
They should be scared for a change.

801
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,780
For now, all of you
look more petrified to me.

802
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,810
You're about to make a huge mistake.
It will upset Gandhiji.

803
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:38,800
The British are upset too.

804
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:40,850
Gandhiji...

805
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:45,120
Mr. Bose along with
two thousand people...

806
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:47,430
attacked Fort Williams,

807
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:49,500
do you think it's justified?

808
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,900
Mr. Gandhi...

809
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:56,410
doesn't this go against your basic
tenets of nonviolence?

810
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,080
In your country England,

811
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:05,510
don't they have
the Bertram Mills Circus?

812
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,190
That is all it was. A circus.

813
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,200
-So, we have dried mix vegetable.
-Can I have a bite?

814
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,630
Enough.

815
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,740
[Darbari Lal] Mr. Bose, you have to come with us.

816
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:23,720
Can I eat first?

817
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:25,860
Eat it at the police station.

818
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,730
Wait. Let him finish his dinner.

819
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,940
I thought your boss had
forgotten about me.

820
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,800
So, what's the charge this time?

821
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,940
-Come with me, you'll get your...
-[Sarat] Subhash!

822
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,340
I'll get you out on bail tomorrow morning.

823
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,290
It's Friday. You won't get
bail for the next three days.

824
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,220
You see,
the British are getting smarter.

825
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,840
Mother, pack my dinner for the jail.
And pack a little more.

826
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,300
-Darbari likes mix vegetables.
-No, I won't eat.

827
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,730
What's the matter?

828
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,050
You've have been chasing me for months.
What's there to hide?

829
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:07,130
Also, I think betrayal is
not new to you.

830
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,870
I mean, for people like you.

831
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,170
So, now you've got yourself a uniform.

832
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:20,080
Last time, when we were selling you khadi,
you had a problem.

833
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,810
And now that we're buying khaki from
you people, you still have a problem.

834
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,540
You descended on the streets of Calcutta
with two thousand people.

835
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,590
What makes you think you can do that?

836
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,080
Because it's my country.

837
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:42,550
And I am free to do whatever I want.

838
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:44,890
I don't need anyone's permission.

839
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:48,030
Do you really think
you can get away with this?

840
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,410
Mr. Stanley.

841
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:53,380
I always get away.

842
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,940
[Stanley] April 1928, Subhash Chandra Bose.

843
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:01,450
Dangerous enemy of the British Raj!

844
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,760
He can't be controlled by Congress.

845
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:09,260
They have an army of
two thousand natives today.

846
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,780
Their numbers are going to surge.

847
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,970
What is the news from Taiwan?

848
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,110
Bose may still be alive.

849
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,490
[Man] Are you sure?

850
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,940
[Man] If he returns to India now
neither the British government

851
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,300
nor the Indian Congress would be
able to stop him.

852
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,010
No one has seen this file.

853
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:37,810
[Stanley] Kinji Watanabe says that he saw Bose
get on the plane with four big boxes,

854
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,150
5 feet by 2 feet,
all filled with the INA gold.

855
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,550
How much gold do you think
that would be, Darbari Lal?

856
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:49,660
People have given gold, diamonds and
ornaments in huge amounts to the INA.

857
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,630
-Women have given jewelry in kilos.
-He was carrying so much gold!

858
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,730
But wasn't he going to Singapore
to surrender?

859
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:00,360
[Stanley] So why was he carrying so much gold?

860
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,780
Stan...

861
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,430
Is it that Bose chap?

862
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,490
[Woman] Aren't you getting a little
obsessed now?

863
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,220
[Woman] Just get done with it, will you?

864
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,240
We're getting late for the show.
Let's go.

865
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,410
Stanley.

866
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,620
You're not listening to me.

867
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,410
Sorry, dear, what?

868
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,470
He's the greatest escape artist ever!

869
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,660
Wish I could see him in person.

870
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:33,180
Who?

871
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,420
Many believed

872
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,550
that Bose was carrying
11 kilos of gold in four boxes.

873
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,840
But Stanley believed

874
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:22,890
it was not possible to have
only 11 kilos of gold in four boxes!

875
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:27,510
About 11 kilos of gold were recovered
from briefcase.

876
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,330
that Bose carried on the plane.

877
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,600
Sir, I don't understand.

878
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:35,340
He was carrying four giant boxes,
5 feet by 2 feet.

879
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:36,390
It means...

880
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:41,500
You don't carry 11 kilos of gold,
in four huge boxes!

881
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,180
Bose escaped!

882
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,010
The crash was a ruse!

883
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,670
Rahman, why don't you just tell them?

884
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,950
You can end this torture now.

885
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:42,860
Is Bose dead or alive?

886
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,630
Stanley was convinced
that Bose was alive.

887
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:52,200
All they had to do
was to find Bose.

888
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,980
Meanwhile, British officer Anderson
and Hayat were also looking for Bose.

889
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:01,340
Soon they managed to nab
seven INA officers.

890
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,820
Hasan, Pritam, Gulzara,

891
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:08,740
Chatterjee, Thevy, Sahay and Rahman.

892
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,800
We're not making any progress, Hayat.

893
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,470
Sir, they are INA soldiers.
They're tough.

894
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,870
It's not easy to break them down.

895
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,640
We're running out of time.

896
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,570
Stop!

897
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,660
All of you, outside.

898
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,490
Rahman, I'll ask you again.

899
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,660
What happened after the plane crash?

900
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:47,070
Netaji...

901
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,860
was trying to take off...

902
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:55,610
his coat and my clothes... caught fire.

903
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,220
But you already told us, you had no idea
how Bose was removed from the plane!

904
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,380
I don't remember it!

905
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:07,230
-I, I forgot!
-Does he always stammer this much?

906
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,110
He stutters every now and then.

907
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,960
For the...

908
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:13,680
last two days...

909
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:15,810
you're repeating the same thing...

910
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,580
-Again and again?
-Yes.

911
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,270
Do you have a cigarette?

912
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:29,810
Bloody hell!

913
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,560
We're not torturing him,
he's torturing us.

914
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,100
Is Subhash Chandra Bose alive?

915
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,860
Is Netaji...

916
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,130
alive?

917
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,980
Mister, we want to know
the answer from you.

918
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:49,590
Are you asking me?

919
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:55,510
I wasn't even there when it happened.
What can I possibly tell you?

920
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,760
Gulzara...

921
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:00,250
Rahman has told us four different
versions of the same story.

922
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:04,220
Sir, how can you believe him?

923
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,470
Rahman is a...

924
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,430
is a damn good storyteller.

925
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,750
He tells a story with such conviction
that you won't be able to understand

926
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,580
the difference between fact and fiction.

927
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,510
Well done. Well done.

928
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,790
Do you think it's a joke?

929
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,340
It's not a joke.

930
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,900
He is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose!

931
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,900
They're laughing at us.
Can't you hear them?

932
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:42,140
It's a game to them, you see.

933
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,050
Biding their time while
Bose is slipping away.

934
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,990
Have you any idea what it would mean
if Bose did get away?

935
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,760
-Bose is dead, sir.
-Ah, yes of course.

936
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:56,420
The British contingent found
some clues but

937
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:58,700
none of them confirmed that Bose is alive.

938
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,800
And I think they are creating
this fear in us.

939
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:05,090
By making it seem that
they have something to hide.

940
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,170
What do you make of this?

941
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:16,020
It says, Bose is dead.

942
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:17,500
No.

943
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:20,810
Gandhi says Bose is dead.

944
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,820
Gandhi, you see, is protecting Bose.

945
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,540
But, if Bose does return to India,

946
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,740
we will execute him as a war criminal.

947
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:31,780
-Very true.
-And he will.

948
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:33,940
If he intends to lead his army.

949
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:35,920
Do you know who else was on the plane?

950
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,720
Colonel Shidei, another war criminal.

951
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,210
Stanley Allen, IG, Calcutta Police.

952
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,340
-David Anderson, a pleasure to meet you.
-Likewise.

953
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,500
Hayat Khan.

954
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,970
Please have a seat.

955
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,880
So now you accused two people of
faking their deaths.

956
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,050
-Isn't that a little paranoid?
-No.

957
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:58,800
It's not paranoia.

958
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:00,590
You don't know Bose like I do.

959
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,960
He poses the greatest risk
to the British Raj.

960
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,080
Not Gandhi, not Congress.

961
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:10,150
Right now, we don't know where he is.

962
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,700
And that should make us very, very afraid.

963
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,990
1930, Calcutta.

964
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,940
After resigning from ICS,

965
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:23,040
selling khadi to the British
and after coming out of jail,

966
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:26,360
Bose was elected as the Mayor of Calcutta.

967
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,760
Hail Mr. Bose!

968
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:30,680
Hail Mr. Bose!

969
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:32,620
Hail Mr. Bose!

970
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,580
Hail Mr. Bose!

971
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:36,480
Hail Mr. Bose!

972
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:38,390
Hail Mr. Bose!

973
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,800
Hail Mr. Bose!

974
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:47,050
Now, you're the Mayor of Calcutta.

975
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:50,790
So, no more armies marching
through the city.

976
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,980
Calcutta is too small for my army,
Mr. Stanley.

977
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,850
My army will be marching throughout
the country now.

978
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,570
And how exactly do you plan to do that?

979
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:06,940
It will be one step at a time.

980
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:10,310
It will be when you least expect it.

981
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:14,740
It might be happening now.
So, sleep light.

982
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,240
I always do.

983
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:19,740
Sir, it's not just uniforms,
but weapons that make an army.

984
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:23,710
Now that he is the Mayor,
he won't get a chance to fight.

985
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,690
Am I right, Mr. Bose?

986
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,720
Only you can give me
that chance, Darbari.

987
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:30,780
People like you never mend their ways,
do they?

988
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:35,590
Hail Mr. Bose!

989
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,610
Hail Mr. Bose!

990
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,580
Hail Mr. Bose!

991
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:41,420
Hail Mr. Bose!

992
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,400
The British gave him
another chance.

993
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:47,220
There was an uprising in Bengal
and Bose wouldn't back down now.

994
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,210
He gave fiery speeches
and joined the protests.

995
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,810
They are trying to infect us
with venereal diseases.

996
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,030
"Stand up together and unite together."

997
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:00,090
"Stand up together and unite together.
Stand up together..."

998
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,470
A rope is a rope, but it can also
be a noose around your neck.

999
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,020
"Stand up together and unite together."

1000
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:12,360
In 1931,
the British arrested Bose, again.

1001
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:13,410
Bloody hell!

1002
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,810
I think that's enough.

1003
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,390
Is he really going to use it?

1004
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:17,710
I don't know.

1005
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:20,840
I have a proposal for you.

1006
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,490
All of this can stop.

1007
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:30,590
All you have to do
is come with me to Taihoku

1008
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,300
and show me the crash site.

1009
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:38,150
You know, I can't touch you, Rahman.

1010
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:41,160
You're the only eyewitness.

1011
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:44,900
The rest of you, however,
are of no use to us.

1012
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,680
Except for one thing.

1013
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:51,930
Darbari Lal, everybody out.

1014
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,960
Darbari Lal?

1015
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,470
Now, with each turn...

1016
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:07,690
these screws will go deeper
into your skull.

1017
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:10,590
The British tried everything.

1018
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:14,380
They used a torture device known as brain
crusher from the era of World War.

1019
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,110
But, these were INA officers, after all.

1020
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,790
They were unbreakable.

1021
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,350
Sahay sang like a canary.

1022
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:36,250
Japanese officer Isoda met them
on 20th of August at Hanoi.

1023
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:39,010
He informed that Bose has escaped
to Manchuria.

1024
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,340
Brilliant, Stanley!

1025
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,400
But, did he say why Bose was going
to Manchuria?

1026
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:46,880
He wants to get to Russia.

1027
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,500
And why Russia?

1028
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:49,940
He's building his army.

1029
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,080
The one he's been always talking about.

1030
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:56,410
Well then, I must get a man
in Manchuria immediately.

1031
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:59,310
Did you know he has
a German wife and child?

1032
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:01,310
Really?

1033
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,820
That cad!

1034
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,430
Emilie Schenkel!

1035
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,540
He's contacted the family
a couple of times.

1036
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:11,220
-We need to put eyes on her too.
-Of course.

1037
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,280
If Bose is alive,

1038
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,140
he will attempt to get in touch with her.

1039
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:27,930
Give me two apples.

1040
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:29,430
Yes, sure.

1041
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,720
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

1042
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:39,040
Mrs. Bose...

1043
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,700
Mrs. Bose, has Subhash Chandra Bose
contacted you?

1044
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:42,970
I don't understand.

1045
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:47,670
Mrs. Bose, we know you speak
fluent English.

1046
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:50,920
We are aware of your relationship with
Subhash Chandra Bose.

1047
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:53,150
-We want to speak to you.
-I don't understand.

1048
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:57,770
Listen, we can help you out.

1049
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:02,220
It's Emilie Schenkel, not Bose.

1050
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:07,590
Mother.

1051
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,300
How was your day?

1052
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,350
-Where's Anita?
-She's asleep.

1053
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:48,690
Vienna, 1934.

1054
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:53,360
Bose feigned illness and
slipped through the British net to Vienna

1055
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:55,100
to complete his book about
the freedom struggle.

1056
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,610
Miss Schenkel, Mrs. Strauss.

1057
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,250
-Lovely to meet you, Mr. Bose.
-Pleasure.

1058
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,330
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1059
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:02,280
Please sit.

1060
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:05,430
Dr. Mathur must have mentioned.

1061
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,290
I'm looking for a stenographer.

1062
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,360
Someone who is skilled with shorthand.

1063
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:12,040
-Shorthand?
-Yes.

1064
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:15,430
I need someone to take dictation
for the book I'm planning to write.

1065
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,210
So proficiency in English is a must.

1066
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,100
Mr. Bose, my German is much better
than my English.

1067
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:24,950
But my English is better than
anyone around here.

1068
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:28,030
Dr. Mathur spoke very highly
of your English.

1069
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:29,440
And your shorthand skills.

1070
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:30,650
Good to know.

1071
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:33,060
-Dr. Mathur is very kind.
-He is.

1072
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,750
What about you? How's your English?

1073
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:37,620
-English?
-Yeah!

1074
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,180
Can you speak English, can you write it?

1075
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,250
(Speaking German)

1076
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:45,430
I think, she doesn't understand.

1077
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,890
Well, in that case,
you're the chosen one.

1078
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:53,630
-Thank you. Thank you for coming.
-Sure.

1079
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,460
I don't think if she's getting it.

1080
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:02,960
(Speaking German)

1081
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,770
(Speaking German)

1082
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:11,740
(Speaking German)

1083
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,260
She looked miffed, what did you tell her?

1084
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,440
I told her that, this man doesn't
intend to pay you

1085
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:23,270
and that he will make you work for free.

1086
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,300
But I have a stipend. I can pay.

1087
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:29,610
I know, Mr. Bose, it's just she would
feel really bad

1088
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,970
knowing that she's losing
on a paid job.

1089
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:34,990
You're very kind.

1090
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:40,470
Dr. Mathur told me you were
going to be a nun?

1091
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:43,970
My father wanted me to be one.

1092
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:46,930
I went to nunnery for four years.

1093
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,980
Was married to Christ.

1094
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,040
And?

1095
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,720
And nothing.

1096
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:59,080
After that, I realized that
it's not something I want to be.

1097
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:02,690
What about you, Mr. Bose?

1098
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,100
Not my father but my mother
wanted me to be married...

1099
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:10,150
Not to Christ, of course.
But to a girl.

1100
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:13,360
I'm married to a cause now.

1101
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,340
Liberate India!

1102
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,090
Azidi, right?

1103
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:23,300
Azadi, that's how you say it.

1104
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:25,200
Freedom!

1105
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:28,830
It's kind of being married to
Christ only.

1106
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:32,820
I can't marry anyone else now.

1107
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,650
I am glad you told me before I asked.

1108
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:42,430
1934.

1109
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:46,160
When Chancellor
Engelbert Dollfuss was murdered,

1110
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:48,200
situation started
to worsen in Austria.

1111
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:52,860
The new chancellor and the fear of
his army could be felt on the streets.

1112
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,260
Bose, the dictator has been shot dead.

1113
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:28,580
That means now Anton Rintelen
would take over

1114
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:30,910
and become the next chancellor of Austria.

1115
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,440
The Nazis will be rising now.

1116
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,470
Subhash, how can you admire the Nazis?

1117
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,000
There is so much violence,
can't you see that?

1118
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:42,150
Freedom comes with a cost, Emilie!

1119
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,680
And sometimes that cost is violence.

1120
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:48,660
The army... it turned against
their own government.

1121
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:52,300
-It means they're all traitors.
-That is exactly what India needs.

1122
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:56,170
An army, an uprising, an insurgency!

1123
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,840
But we don't have money for that.

1124
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:01,320
Come.

1125
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,840
12th November, 1945. That's it.

1126
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:26,330
Looking for him in Manchuria
may help, may not.

1127
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,840
Spying on Emilie Schenkel
may help, maybe not.

1128
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:33,250
But if we want to find Bose,
we need to find the gold.

1129
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,150
Follow the missing gold.

1130
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:38,180
He needs it to build his army.

1131
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,530
"The call for freedom
from millions of voices."

1132
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:50,630
"Look straight into
the eyes of the enemy."

1133
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:53,700
"A story from Tokyo to Rangoon."

1134
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:55,530
"A steadfast mind makes a man get up."

1135
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:56,690
"Get up, stand up."

1136
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:58,470
"Freedom knows the need of now."

1137
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,970
"He demands a new time,
the keys of independence."

1138
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:11,180
Only one person knew about
the INA gold apart from Mr. Bose

1139
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:15,300
and he was an INA soldier
and his trusted confidant, Ram Murthy.

1140
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,420
A secret so difficult to hide.

1141
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,200
Good to see you, Colonel.

1142
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,540
Would you like a seat?

1143
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,670
I'm not here to have a cup of tea.

1144
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:28,780
And what you have is for safe keeping
and not for spending.

1145
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:33,010
I'm spending just about enough
to mend the dent.

1146
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,650
And just so you know,

1147
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,890
there is a price for recklessness.

1148
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,060
Be careful, Mr. Ram Murthy.

1149
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:42,670
And what if the British find out
who you are?

1150
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:45,120
We're war criminals.

1151
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:46,780
I think, you should be careful.

1152
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,840
-And when Netaji gets back...
-Oh you think he'll be back?

1153
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,840
He was an INA soldier.

1154
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:09,290
Although, I can't understand
why he came back to India.

1155
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,470
Is it ancestral?

1156
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:13,220
Show it to me.

1157
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:16,260
Keep it here. Keep it.

1158
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,780
You see, even the dead have
a story to tell.

1159
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,660
There's an odor to gold.

1160
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:46,370
No matter how hard you try,
you can't suppress it.

1161
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,070
I'm getting that odor from this.

1162
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:53,340
What's this?

1163
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,840
The dead man we found

1164
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:02,680
was bringing this to show
someone in India.

1165
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:07,020
As you know, the poor Japanese
don't have any food or water.

1166
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,950
And yet, two Indians
are having a ball there.

1167
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:15,010
Mr. Bose was in Japan
and he's also in Japan.

1168
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,620
What does this say?

1169
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:19,830
Sir, it's written in Japanese.

1170
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:23,330
[Speaking Japanese]

1171
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,560
Hey, English, talk in English!

1172
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:27,010
In English, you...

1173
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,380
-Can you speak Japanese?
-No, sir.

1174
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:33,600
So, stop staring at my face
and get me someone who does!

1175
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:35,410
No one knows Japanese, sir.

1176
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,220
How do you talk to him then?

1177
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:38,520
We don't need to talk, do we?

1178
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,200
I'm not getting my daughter married
into his family.

1179
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:42,860
Stop giggling, you fool!

1180
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:45,700
All they know is Bengali, not Japanese!

1181
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:47,510
I feel we're banging
our heads on the wall!

1182
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,240
Hang on!

1183
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:52,350
We have someone who knows Japanese.

1184
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,710
You've spent a lot of time in Japan.

1185
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,730
You were quite close to Bose.

1186
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,740
Netaji is... dead.

1187
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:02,260
What's the point in raking up the past?

1188
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:06,560
Forget about past.
We're here for something else.

1189
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,350
Bring him in.

1190
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:14,520
You may leave.

1191
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,440
Translate this.

1192
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:23,890
Ram Murthy and J. Murthy,

1193
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:26,820
are enjoying
and having a nice time in Japan.

1194
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,040
They used to drive around
in luxury cars.

1195
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,450
They own a bungalow,
a restaurant and two luxury cars.

1196
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:35,270
What does it say?

1197
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,110
What does it say?

1198
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,320
Ram Murthy and J Murthy...

1199
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:48,180
live a very luxurious life in Japan.

1200
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,840
They're often seen travelling...

1201
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:53,160
in expensive cars.

1202
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:54,400
What else?

1203
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:55,930
They own a bungalow,

1204
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:00,270
a restaurant and two sedan cars.

1205
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,720
Who were Murthy brothers?
Were they close to Netaji?

1206
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:05,620
They were INA officers, living in Japan.

1207
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:09,930
What's the connection between INA gold
and the Murthy brothers?

1208
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,570
You're saying...

1209
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:13,690
in a poor country like Japan,

1210
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,660
two soldiers had so much money?

1211
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:18,840
Well, you stole all our money.

1212
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:23,160
At least, spare the outsiders.

1213
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:26,360
They already know
that this is about the INA gold.

1214
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:29,720
The Japanese Army handed it
to the Murthy brothers.

1215
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:33,110
And you trust everything that
Japanese tell you?

1216
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:36,680
Rahman, you stopped stammering
all of a sudden.

1217
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:38,770
Where's the INA gold?

[Speaking Japanese]

1228
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,260
[Speaking Japanese]

1229
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,380
What are you talking about?

1230
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:15,160
Why did he say Netaji?

1231
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:18,720
The Japanese POW told Rahman
that Netaji was alive.

1232
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:19,820
He further said

1233
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:22,760
that the wound on Rahman's hand
was not from the plane crash

1234
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:24,830
but it was rather an acid burn.

1235
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,570
Rahman, is Bose still alive?

1236
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:36,340
Stanley suspected something
strange and important was afoot

1237
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,940
but he couldn't quite put
his finger on it.

1238
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:45,030
Bose's story was turning out
to be an endless drama.

1239
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:47,140
If we follow the rumors,

1240
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:50,300
before anyone could solve
the mystery of Netaji's death,

1241
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:52,300
someone had spotted Bose

1242
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:54,600
or Bose's lookalike in Manchuria.

1243
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:03,670
-What?
-I want to send a message.

1244
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,510
No, no. I will type.

1245
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,450
-What?
-I will type.

1246
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,930
No...

1247
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:16,490
Move.

1248
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,500
Sit.

1249
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,740
There's a telegram for you, sir.

1250
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:14,570
Keep the gold safe,
we will need it to raise an army.

1251
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:31,640
-Hello.
-Hello, this is Ram Murthy.

1252
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:34,170
I've got a telegram from Bose.

1253
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,860
He's alive... in Manchuria.

1254
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,620
British officer John Figgs
was in Manchuria

1255
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,730
and he also got the news
that Bose was alive.

1256
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,060
Ram Murthy graduated from
a traitor to an informant

1257
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:48,730
and all it took was a phone call.

1258
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,670
Bose got in touch for his gold.

1259
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:58,730
He did?

1260
01:17:59,490 --> 01:18:00,920
He wants to get his army.

1261
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:03,440
What's the story with this man?

1262
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:05,480
When does he give up?

1263
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:07,690
That's the thing with Bose.

1264
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:09,520
He never gives up.

1265
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,350
We need to raise an army now.

1266
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:16,410
The British have divided
Hindus and Muslims in our country.

1267
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,810
For the Hindus, they have Congress
and for the Muslims, Muslim League.

1268
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:22,610
They've issued an arrest warrant
against you.

1269
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:26,800
It clearly says you'd be arrested
if you go back to India.

1270
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:30,120
The entire British Raj
is after your life.

1271
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,060
Tell me something new.

1272
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,170
People are chasing me since my childhood.

1273
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:38,620
Mark my words, Dr. Mathur.
I'll be chased even after my death.

1274
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:40,900
Then why are you going back to India?

1275
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:45,580
To form my government.

1276
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,500
And you think they'll let you do it?

1277
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:54,910
Mr. Bose... Please.

1278
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,470
Dr. Mathur, there are more Indians
in India than the Brits.

1279
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,790
I'll form my government with their help.

1280
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:05,100
Mr. Bose, you've just had surgery.
Please.

1281
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:08,850
I have a better reason
to stay back than the surgery.

1282
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,770
Can you give this letter
to Miss Schenkl?

1283
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:15,650
See you soon.

1284
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:52,790
You're very kind.

1285
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:01,680
Azidi, right?

1286
01:20:02,610 --> 01:20:05,190
Azadi. That's how you say it.

1287
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:07,910
Even the iceberg sometimes melts.

1288
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,700
And so, it is with me now.

1289
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:15,040
I have already sold myself
to my first love,

1290
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:17,470
that is my country.

1291
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,050
I don't know
what the future holds for me.

1292
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:31,530
Maybe, I'll languish in prison.

1293
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:34,040
Or perhaps,
I'll be sent to the gallows.

1294
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:39,830
Maybe a single bullet
will bring everything to an end.

1295
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:45,000
We'll probably never meet again.

1296
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,560
I may not even write to you again.

1297
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:52,470
But, you're always in my thoughts.

1298
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:58,980
1937, Bose left Emilie

1299
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:01,470
and despite several warnings
from his supporters

1300
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,330
Bose returned to Calcutta.

1301
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:06,370
Back in Vienna,
Emilie's long wait had just begun

1302
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:10,260
but for Indians,
the four-year long wait was over.

1303
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:12,090
Long live!

1304
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:13,200
How are you?

1305
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:14,630
Long live!

1306
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:17,900
Long live!

1307
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:22,120
"...beyond the sun..."

1308
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:24,320
-How are you?
-All good.

1309
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:26,710
Hemal.

1310
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,070
Why did you come back, Subhash?

1311
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,160
I had to.

1312
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:34,970
This is my country.

1313
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,080
You know, I always come back.

1314
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:43,500
"...it will go away!"

1315
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:51,290
"...with passion..."

1316
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:52,690
Move aside.

1317
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:57,960
-Move.
-Bose, you were told not to come back.

1318
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:00,600
And you were told to go back.

1319
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:03,840
You did not listen to me.
Why should I listen to you?

1320
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:09,740
Darbari, you have aged terribly.

1321
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:14,310
Stop chasing me
and take care of yourself.

1322
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,950
We'll achieve our freedom very soon.

1323
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:23,160
Subhash Chandra Bose,
you're being arrested.

1324
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:24,570
On what grounds?

1325
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,240
Let's go, Bose. Come on.

1326
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:29,780
Come on.

1327
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,680
Long live the revolution!

1328
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:34,590
Long live the revolution!

1329
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:36,240
Long live freedom!

1330
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,330
I don't need to give you a reason.

1331
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:40,790
We told you not to come back.

1332
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,470
Darbari, you had no one to chase
after I left.

1333
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:47,400
Did you arrest anyone else
or were you just waiting for me?

1334
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:50,420
Why did you come back, Mr. Bose?
We told you not to.

1335
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:53,960
No one can stop an Indian from
coming back to his own country.

1336
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,240
This is my country.

1337
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,230
-There will be no British rule.
-Calm down, Mr. Bose.

1338
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,980
We've been calm far too long, Darbari.

1339
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,340
Not anymore.

1340
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:15,160
Release Bose now. That's an order.

1341
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,390
Sir, that would be a mistake.

1342
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:18,940
Bose needs to be locked up.

1343
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:22,600
He's a disease.
He needs to be contained.

1344
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:24,450
Do you see the crowd outside?

1345
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:26,380
Do you want to make him a martyr?

1346
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,380
Hail Bose!

1347
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:30,570
Hail Bose!

1348
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:32,910
Release him now.

1349
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:35,480
You there! Now.

1350
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:49,090
"This adroit voyager"

1351
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:53,640
"for the love of his land"

1352
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:58,050
"will head back home!"

1353
01:23:58,290 --> 01:24:00,380
Bose was exiled,
but his impassioned countrymen

1354
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:02,930
propelled him straight into
the Congress headquarters.

1355
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:07,490
Bose won the 1938
the Congress president elections.

1356
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,090
Apart from the British, there were others

1357
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,280
-who were troubled with Bose.
-Hail Bose.

1358
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:16,340
Congress was soon to witness
the battle between Khaki and Khadi.

1359
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:17,780
All hail Mr. Bose!

1360
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:19,490
All hail Mr. Bose!

1361
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,740
I've spoken to all the party workers.

1362
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:23,140
We've explained everything.

1363
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:24,600
Everyone's ready.

1364
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:27,070
Baapu, Subhash is here.

1365
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:31,590
Subhash.

1366
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:34,870
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

1367
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:36,540
-How are you?
-I'm fine, too.

1368
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:37,660
Have a seat.

1369
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:42,220
-Greetings, Baapu.
-Kindly wait outside for ten minutes.

1370
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:47,720
How are you?

1371
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,480
Subhash, you're going down the wrong path.

1372
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:54,080
I respect your principle of nonviolence.

1373
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,420
But I don't think we can achieve
freedom with nonviolence.

1374
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:00,200
-Subhash...
-Baapu, half the world

1375
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:03,040
is preparing to fight
against the British.

1376
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:07,410
If we support the Brits now,
India will never achieve freedom.

1377
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:10,890
If we have to sacrifice,
why sacrifice for the British?

1378
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:12,970
Why not for our country?

1379
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:17,350
Subhash, your ideals are at loggerheads
with the Congress ideals.

1380
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,970
Our ideals are at loggerheads,
but our goal is the same.

1381
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,280
To liberate India.

1382
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:27,610
Since you refuse to listen...

1383
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:32,030
I can't support you, Subhash.

1384
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:35,890
"It's difficult to understand Subhash."

1385
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:37,950
You can at least
grant me your blessings.

1386
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:42,550
You call me Bapu,
yet you don't listen to me.

1387
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:48,480
As you wish.

1388
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:50,330
I'll take your leave.

1389
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,270
Nehru.

1390
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:55,630
"It's difficult to understand Subhash."

1391
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:57,580
-I'll just be back.
-Okay.

1392
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:02,830
Nehru, you must speak to Bapu.

1393
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:06,250
We need an army to fight,
not a spinning wheel.

1394
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:09,470
-How can we raise an army?
-Why not?

1395
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,840
Look around you.
You're surrounded by an army.

1396
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:16,790
If 250,000 Indians can fight
for the British,

1397
01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:18,690
why can't they fight for us?

1398
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,990
"His actions faster than thoughts."

1399
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:22,600
Talk to Bapu.

1400
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,750
"They'd look for him where he was not."

1401
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,380
"Bose!"

1402
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:28,510
"Incapable of being caught."

1403
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:29,910
"Bose!"

1404
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,520
"His lines were sharp
and theirs would blot."

1405
01:26:32,610 --> 01:26:34,490
What is about this Bose chap

1406
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:36,940
that drives people to frenzy?

1407
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:42,070
I have been hearing reports
that he's on his way to Manchuria.

1408
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:46,530
So if there's anything that
we need to know, we should be informed.

1409
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:50,930
Do you think Bose is alive?

1410
01:26:54,150 --> 01:26:55,520
Hypothetically...

1411
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:58,970
if he is alive
and he does return

1412
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,760
who would be Prime Minister, Mr. Nehru?

1413
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:03,220
"Right, right, right."

1414
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:04,920
"What I said is right!"

1415
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,700
-I want to meet Mr. Andrew.
-And the purpose of your visit?

1416
01:27:27,070 --> 01:27:28,900
-He wanted a file.
-[Man] Which file?

1417
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,400
Jai Hind!

1418
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:23,310
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

1419
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:01,420
Bapu was remembering you.

1420
01:29:01,930 --> 01:29:03,700
The British were remembering you too.

1421
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:07,360
My Congress presidency has created
troubles for Bapu and the British.

1422
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:10,210
I'm the man who united them.

1423
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:12,680
If I could do the same for India...

1424
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,550
That's all I hope for.

1425
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:15,980
Subhash.

1426
01:29:18,510 --> 01:29:20,590
But Mr. Bose, Congress?

1427
01:29:21,010 --> 01:29:22,010
I'll talk to them.

1428
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,090
And Gandhiji?

1429
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,690
-You got the papers?
-Yes.

1430
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:28,640
Mr. Bose, you sure have style.

1431
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:29,650
Have a seat.

1432
01:29:30,460 --> 01:29:31,540
Be seated.

1433
01:29:32,290 --> 01:29:36,270
You come strolling into
the police station as if it's a park.

1434
01:29:37,450 --> 01:29:39,320
-[Darbari] Will you have some snacks or tea?
-No.

1435
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:42,240
So what brings you here?

1436
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:44,310
I'm here to put up bail
for Benoy's accomplices.

1437
01:29:45,230 --> 01:29:46,150
Why?

1438
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:50,000
For years, the Congress encouraged
protestors to go to jail.

1439
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:53,220
We want to reverse the trend
by freeing the protestors.

1440
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:56,900
But Mr. Bose, how can we let them go?
They are rioters.

1441
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:58,500
We've also recovered a pistol from them.

1442
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:03,270
I'm impressed. The British Police
are finally learning the law.

1443
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,780
This time, you've got a reason too.

1444
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:06,900
Mr. Bose, you aren't behind, are you?

1445
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:09,100
On one hand,
you chant the virtues of nonviolence,

1446
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,580
but shoot the British
in broad daylight on the other.

1447
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:12,530
That's fine.

1448
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:14,170
Benoy didn't shoot anyone
in the back.

1449
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:17,260
Unlike the British
who stab you in the back.

1450
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,070
Get the papers.

1451
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:27,720
Tell me something, Darbari.

1452
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:30,600
Is the law of nonviolence applicable
only to Indians?

1453
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,080
Did you ever hear a Britisher
talking about nonviolence?

1454
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:36,320
Well, I never did.

1455
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:41,320
Matto, get the bail papers.

1456
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,860
Mr. Bose, you're making a huge mistake.

1457
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:47,650
This goes against your own values.

1458
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,150
Strange! Darbari is lecturing us
about values.

1459
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:54,820
Benoy Bandopadhyay's
actions are wrong.

1460
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:57,160
You validated his actions
with Congress support

1461
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:59,820
and are encouraging
violence and brutality!

1462
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:03,070
Do you people seriously believe

1463
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:05,860
that you can bring about revolution

1464
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:08,950
by wearing pristine white clothes
and without shedding a drop of blood?

1465
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:11,390
It's hardly a year
since you're back from Europe.

1466
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:13,600
Do you even know the ground realities?

1467
01:31:13,690 --> 01:31:16,850
Subhash, have you ever taken
any advice from anyone?

1468
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:19,370
We all want freedom.

1469
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:20,610
Really?

1470
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,430
-You want freedom?
-[Man]Yes.

1471
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:25,940
Well, you've kept it quite
a secret, then.

1472
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:30,800
Benoy Bandopadhyay is an example
of what a gigantic failure we are!

1473
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:33,620
What he did is an act of desperation.

1474
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:36,740
How do you plan to achieve freedom?

1475
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,650
Do you have a blueprint?

1476
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,550
You must have a plan.

1477
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:43,480
Subhash, it won't happen in a day.

1478
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:45,200
How much time will it take?

1479
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,230
Six months, a year, five years
or ten years?

1480
01:31:49,730 --> 01:31:50,880
When will we achieve freedom?

1481
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:54,280
No one has achieved freedom
only by talking and meetings.

1482
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:56,400
For freedom, you need a revolution.

1483
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,010
All of you are contesting
the upcoming elections.

1484
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,900
You're forming a government
with the British.

1485
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,610
There's exchange of money!

1486
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,120
The Congress is only interested in
forming a government!

1487
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:09,000
They have no interest in freedom!

1488
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:12,920
By the way, it's because of the Congress
government that trade unions exist.

1489
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:14,010
It's because of us.

1490
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,020
The workers finally got their rights!

1491
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:18,410
And when the same workers were
rotting in a prison cell?

1492
01:32:18,710 --> 01:32:22,280
What will you do if this government
asks you to shoot workers?

1493
01:32:22,530 --> 01:32:24,900
Will you support the government
or the workers?

1494
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:27,510
Do you know what the Congress is like?

1495
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:29,390
It's like a street dog.

1496
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:32,980
-It neither has a master nor a home!
-Mr. Bose!

1497
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:37,250
Save your anger for the British,
it will be useful.

1498
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:44,250
Here's your government.

1499
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:49,260
You shouldn't let me out.

1500
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,320
Tell me, Mr. Stanley, a war is coming.

1501
01:32:56,630 --> 01:32:59,480
What if all Indian soldiers
refuse to fight for His Majesty?

1502
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:02,610
Will you dare take on Hitler
without us?

1503
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:04,600
Or will you beg us to support him?

1504
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:10,830
Take him.

1505
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:14,890
Did Bose actually say that?
That is a threat.

1506
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:16,620
Well, that is what I heard.

1507
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:19,850
And did he say, if someone slaps you once,
slap him twice!

1508
01:33:20,330 --> 01:33:22,260
No, no. That's... that's just a rumor.

1509
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,500
Long time ago, he slapped a professor...

1510
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:28,200
then this whole legend grew out of
that unfortunate incident.

1511
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:31,110
Isn't that the complete opposite
of what Gandhi said?

1512
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:32,450
Turn the other cheek!

1513
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:35,000
I believe, Bose commands
quite a following.

1514
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:36,970
But I like Gandhi.

1515
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:40,130
[Woman] I wish more Indians were
like Gandhi, I feel terribly unsafe.

1516
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:41,870
No, there's nothing to worry about.

1517
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:44,430
Bose is well taken care of,
for the time being.

1518
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:46,360
-Cheers.
-I hope so.

1519
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:51,420
You didn't hear me,
you can't get bail that easily.

1520
01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:55,480
It requires documents, a lawyer,
you have to make rounds of the court.

1521
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:58,400
Mr. Bose cannot be released.
You people can leave.

1522
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:02,660
[Bose] Greetings.

1523
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:14,950
What are you doing, Mr. Bose?

1524
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:18,900
Your revolution is spreading
like a disease.

1525
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:24,100
But don't you worry,
the British are equally irrepressible.

1526
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:26,310
They'll figure out
something very soon.

1527
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:30,690
Darbari, you can throw revolutionaries
behind bars

1528
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:34,060
but how can you possibly tame
our revolution?

1529
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:39,020
Ask Stanley and open an account for me.

1530
01:34:39,330 --> 01:34:40,300
For bail, you know.

1531
01:34:41,070 --> 01:34:42,670
[Bose] I'll be a regular here.

1532
01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:46,910
Here's your confession.

1533
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:49,960
The quicker you sign it,

1534
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,910
[Darbari] the quicker you'll get
your bail papers ready.

1535
01:34:55,490 --> 01:34:57,930
-Why should I sign?
-Don't you want to go home?

1536
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:59,200
No.

1537
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:02,100
I want to send the British
back to their homes.

1538
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:03,790
Is there any document for that?

1539
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,950
Mr. Bose, you shouldn't rub shoulders
with these junkies and thieves.

1540
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,210
Just sign and leave. What are you doing?

1541
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:12,430
Back in Europe, I learnt a trick, Darbari.

1542
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:14,280
Would you like to see?

1543
01:35:15,550 --> 01:35:16,530
Go ahead.

1544
01:35:18,010 --> 01:35:19,100
What's your name?

1545
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:21,260
-Anirudh...
-Keep quiet.

1546
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:22,960
Is he a revolutionary?

1547
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:24,990
He's a junkie.

1548
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:41,640
-Where is the paper?
-[Anirudh] How did you do that?

1549
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:44,190
It's called illusion.

1550
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:46,990
You saw what I wanted to show you.

1551
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:50,630
You couldn't guess
what I really wanted to hide.

1552
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:52,340
Mr. Bose, return the paper, please.

1553
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:55,670
Sadly, I didn't learn
how to bring it back.

1554
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:59,630
Mr. Bose, it's a government document.
Please stop joking.

1555
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:06,680
-Where did it go?
-What are you doing? Where is it?

1556
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,040
-What are...
-You get worried so fast.

1557
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:14,670
You're always after my case.

1558
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:17,610
Kindly sign here and spare me.

1559
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:20,760
I would rather stay in the jail

1560
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:23,690
than sign any papers
from the British.

1561
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:31,210
"Better than the world..."

1562
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:35,980
"is my India."

1563
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:39,630
"Better than the world..."

1564
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:43,290
"We are its nightingales"

1565
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:47,690
"and this is our garden."

1566
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:51,300
"Better than the world"

1567
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:54,530
Very good. Very good.

1568
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:57,580
One at a time.

1569
01:36:59,070 --> 01:37:00,370
-It's confirmed.
-Very nice.

1570
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:01,990
Netaji is alive.

1571
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,990
The British are also aware of it.

1572
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:07,720
We have to warn him somehow.

1573
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:10,930
If the British find him,
it'll be terrible.

1574
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:13,440
Why? Let them arrest him.

1575
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:16,640
People have made a deserter
their God.

1576
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:21,210
Bose can be anything, but he's
not a deserter.

1577
01:37:21,790 --> 01:37:23,350
Three years ago, you said

1578
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:26,940
that if Subhash comes back, you'll be
the first one to take this to him.

1579
01:37:27,610 --> 01:37:30,200
Bose was hounded by the British,

1580
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:32,070
but did the Congress treat him
any better?

1581
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:34,950
That's for me?

1582
01:37:35,650 --> 01:37:36,540
You may leave.

1583
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:40,080
Yogita, very nice.
Dear, thank you.

1584
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:41,750
Come. Come.

1585
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:50,000
Did anyone follow you?

1586
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:54,440
Well, I think I saw Bose in Manchuria.

1587
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:56,760
Don't worry, Mr. Murthy.

1588
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:59,680
-You're quite safe.
-The joke's on you Figges.

1589
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:02,580
Bose is alive and he is dangerous.

1590
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:05,600
He's a fugitive, all alone, on the run.

1591
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:07,260
Bose is never alone.

1592
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:11,820
Are you going to kill him?

1593
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:14,880
The British government doesn't
share its plans with...

1594
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:16,370
everyone.

1595
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:18,820
As if you could kill him!

1596
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:22,710
We all know what happened
the last few times you tried.

1597
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:24,210
Where is the telegram?

1598
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:48,090
The information's right.

1599
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,440
We will bring Bose back.

1600
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:29,850
Beware of the mole who can bring
down the empire.

1601
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:32,210
Ram Murthy was a mole,

1602
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:34,510
but someone had
double crossed him too.

1603
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:37,920
Mohan Singh, Bose's confidant.

1604
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:41,160
The brothers have tipped off
the British about Netaji.

1605
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:44,610
The British Army has sent a contingent
behind Netaji.

1606
01:39:45,730 --> 01:39:48,690
Do not worry. We call on the Ikirio.

1607
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:51,990
Bose will be safe.

1608
01:39:52,990 --> 01:39:55,040
Ikirio means Japanese ghost.

1609
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:58,210
According to the Japanese,
a living man can also be a ghost.

1610
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:02,660
Mohan Singh couldn't understand
what Nakamura was trying to say.

1611
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,080
But what happened that day

1612
01:40:05,170 --> 01:40:07,760
baffled even the British contingent.

1613
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:54,800
Get him!

1614
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:12,090
Hey.

1615
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:29,480
The Ikirio has protected Bose.

1616
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:33,130
Bose... is safe.

1617
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,250
You're not Bose.

1618
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:46,180
Who is Bose?

1619
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:48,870
The man they got hold of
was not Bose.

1620
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:52,720
But the man who got away
could have been Bose or an imposter.

1621
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:54,190
It was hard to say.

1622
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:56,420
If you're not Bose...

1623
01:41:57,970 --> 01:41:59,530
why did you run away
when you saw us?

1624
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,810
Sir, in the normal world

1625
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:06,840
if you're chased by two gunmen,
you will run like hell.

1626
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,140
But that doesn't mean I'm Bose.

1627
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:13,700
Where is Bose?

1628
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:16,400
Didn't you read the news? He's dead.

1629
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:18,170
He's just fooling us around.

1630
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:20,700
Do your sources have anything on Bose?

1631
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:22,040
Yes, sir.

1632
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,600
We just found that Bose has
rented a room in a nearby hotel.

1633
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,330
Is it confirmed?

1634
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:33,930
Excuse me.

1635
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:38,690
It was hard to say
if Bose stayed at that hotel.

1636
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:42,330
Meanwhile, the British Police
nabbed three Indians.

1637
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:45,070
Yes? How may I help you?

1638
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:48,790
A bus driver, a ticket master
and a hotel manager.

1639
01:42:51,860 --> 01:42:53,120
Have you seen this man before?

1640
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:59,550
Are you kidding me?
He's standing right behind you.

1641
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:01,530
Do you take them for fools?

1642
01:43:01,620 --> 01:43:04,840
Will they parade me around
while toting my photo everywhere?

1643
01:43:04,930 --> 01:43:07,400
-The man in the photo is someone...
-Don't say his name.

1644
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:15,350
Take a closer look.

1645
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:18,970
Tell me, if the man in the photo
was at this hotel or was it this man?

1646
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:23,110
No, sir, he was someone else.

1647
01:43:23,510 --> 01:43:25,610
Although, he looked like him,
but he was different.

1648
01:43:26,590 --> 01:43:28,370
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

1649
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:30,460
Who was he and when did he
visit this hotel?

1650
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:33,510
He visited the hotel three days ago.

1651
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:38,560
-I need a room.
-Okay.

1652
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:46,860
-Your name?
-Joseph.

1653
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:52,900
Your signature.

1654
01:44:11,890 --> 01:44:12,780
It's original.

1655
01:44:16,630 --> 01:44:17,750
Room 102.

1656
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:20,960
No, thank you.

1657
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:23,020
Go straight upstairs.

1658
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:27,790
-Go up and check.
-Sir.

1659
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:31,020
What would he do?

1660
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:34,130
His room always stank of burnt pages.

1661
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:38,270
[Manager] He would be holed up in his room
all day long.

1662
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:43,360
[Manager] He wouldn't open the door
for food or for room service.

1663
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:47,290
[Manager] He would just write and burn pages.

1664
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:52,030
[Manager] I was puzzled because
the war was over...

1665
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:54,130
[Manager] I wonder what he was up to.

1666
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:58,060
[Manager] He was eager to leave this hotel.

1667
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:28,480
He asked me if he could rent
a car or a bus.

1668
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:31,890
I'd have driven him to
nearby places.

1669
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:36,390
Later, he asked me to
drop him to a stop before hell.

1670
01:45:36,810 --> 01:45:38,220
He was quite a character.

1671
01:45:42,010 --> 01:45:43,660
How long have you been working here?

1672
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:46,090
-Three years.
-Sir!

1673
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:50,300
These were found in Bose's room.

1674
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:53,190
Sir.

1675
01:45:59,730 --> 01:46:03,530
Call up Anderson and ask about
Watanbe. I need details.

1676
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:05,660
-Yes, sir.
-Move.

1677
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:12,610
-Are you an Indian?
-Yes, sir.

1678
01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:17,270
What are you doing in Manchuria?

1679
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:21,270
I am laborer, sir.
I will follow the money.

1680
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:24,310
We don't call India our home anymore.

1681
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:27,160
It belongs to the British now.

1682
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:30,060
Do you know him?

1683
01:46:31,470 --> 01:46:32,580
No.

1684
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:34,520
I haven't seen him before.

1685
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:36,780
Sir, he's lying, I can tell!

1686
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:38,730
Where did this come from?

1687
01:46:41,050 --> 01:46:42,320
It belongs to my wife.

1688
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:47,690
Where did this come from?

1689
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:54,090
Yes, he was here.

1690
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:56,440
[Bus driver] He was in a tearing hurry.

1691
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:59,820
[Bus driver] He wanted to reach
Incheon in a day.

1692
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:04,030
[Bus driver] He asked me to book
an entire bus to Incheon.

1693
01:47:05,050 --> 01:47:06,060
I want to go to Incheon.

1694
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:07,640
This bus won't go anywhere.

1695
01:47:09,610 --> 01:47:10,880
Do you know me?

1696
01:47:11,530 --> 01:47:14,700
Stop bugging me, will you?
I'm tired, let me sleep.

1697
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:38,850
Make a choice.

1698
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:45,130
To Incheon and please hurry.

1699
01:47:48,390 --> 01:47:49,490
When did he leave?

1700
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:52,030
Two days ago.

1701
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:54,130
Sir, may I leave?

1702
01:47:57,610 --> 01:47:59,670
He wanted to reach Incheon in a day.

1703
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:01,240
He was in a great hurry.

1704
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:08,380
Bloody driver.

1705
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:11,930
You're an Indian, right?

1706
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:14,730
Yes.

1707
01:48:15,410 --> 01:48:16,780
You're about to contribute
to a noble cause.

1708
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:25,930
What's the hurry to reach Incheon?

1709
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:28,000
You've rented the whole bus.

1710
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:32,990
I'm expecting some old friends.
If I don't make it, they'll feel bad.

1711
01:48:33,190 --> 01:48:36,340
If you need food or drinks,
I can arrange it for you.

1712
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:38,230
You can get just about everything.

1713
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:40,680
I need an army. Can you arrange that?

1714
01:48:43,010 --> 01:48:44,000
What?

1715
01:48:44,470 --> 01:48:46,200
An army with tanks,
grenades and rifles.

1716
01:48:56,970 --> 01:48:58,070
Such a strange man.

1717
01:48:58,470 --> 01:49:00,240
I've seen far too many horrors
in this war,

1718
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:02,380
so I can smell trouble from a mile.

1719
01:49:03,780 --> 01:49:05,370
I decided not to follow him
for the same reason.

1720
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:10,040
Was he a dangerous man, sir?

1721
01:49:13,570 --> 01:49:16,720
He vanished before reaching Incheon.
Fine.

1722
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:19,740
There's nothing nearby,
so he must've gone to Incheon.

1723
01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:21,830
He must have gone to meet someone.

1724
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,610
Must be an old friend. Who can he be?

1725
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,620
We're not quite sure,
it was Bose outside of Incheon.

1726
01:49:26,950 --> 01:49:28,340
We have made that mistake before.

1727
01:49:28,430 --> 01:49:30,140
Sir, he's definitely Mr. Bose.

1728
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:34,680
He has hoodwinked us countless times
and vanished without a trace.

1729
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:36,380
That's his hallmark.

1730
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:38,870
We need to think like Bose!

1731
01:49:39,150 --> 01:49:41,860
We need to find out where he's going
and get there first.

1732
01:49:41,950 --> 01:49:43,450
-That's the only way.
-Indeed.

1733
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:44,990
An old friend.

1734
01:49:46,230 --> 01:49:47,400
All right, well, let's see.

1735
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:49,870
Rahman's already in custody.

1736
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:53,630
Ram Murthy has already stabbed him
in the back, so he's out.

1737
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:55,760
Who'd he want to make contact with?

1738
01:49:55,970 --> 01:49:58,360
Especially, now that he seems to have
something on his mind.

1739
01:49:58,590 --> 01:50:02,200
It was Watanbe's name on the burnt pages.

1740
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:05,640
He was close to Bose
among other Japanese soldiers.

1741
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:09,820
Right. We'll get Figgs to track him down.

1742
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:12,460
Find out if he is in Incheon.
Nakamura too.

1743
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:22,980
Anderson sent Figgs and a contingent
of the British police to Japan

1744
01:50:23,070 --> 01:50:27,160
to apprehend INA officers,
Kinji Watanbe and Nakamura.

1745
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:28,220
Hello.

1746
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:31,940
The first thing they learnt

1747
01:50:32,030 --> 01:50:35,680
is that both of them got a phone call
at the same time.

1748
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:47,210
The person who called Watanbe
and Nakamura was a man.

1749
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:49,170
A man who spoke in Japanese.

1750
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:51,620
But, his mother tongue was not Japanese.

1751
01:50:51,710 --> 01:50:53,150
Let's get to the point, Darbari Lal.

1752
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:54,670
The point is that

1753
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:58,350
he spoke Japanese that the meeting was
an underground celebration.

1754
01:50:58,610 --> 01:51:01,230
Underground!
What the devil does that mean?

1755
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:03,560
Underground! He's talking about bunkers.

1756
01:51:04,110 --> 01:51:07,390
We have no idea how many bunkers
the bloody Japs built out here.

1757
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:09,540
We don't need to know,
we just need to follow them

1758
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:11,290
to know where they are going.

1759
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:13,240
That's what I was saying.

1760
01:51:13,330 --> 01:51:17,300
What's shocking is that these people
were also headed to Incheon.

1761
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:23,510
We got him.

1762
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:25,570
We got Bose.

1763
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:29,460
After all these years,
we've finally got Bose.

1764
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:31,720
Well, that would mean
he's beginning to slip up.

1765
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:33,790
He didn't even try to cover
his tracks this time.

1766
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:35,970
That's what I find strange!

1767
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:39,480
Don't you think he's deliberately
leading us to Incheon?

1768
01:51:39,570 --> 01:51:41,430
Like he wants us to go to Incheon.

1769
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:43,780
You're giving him too much credit,
Darbari Lal.

1770
01:51:43,870 --> 01:51:46,510
He's alone, he's tired.
He's making mistakes!

1771
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,260
No, sir. My mother used to say,

1772
01:51:48,350 --> 01:51:51,640
a tired or wounded wise man
is still wise, nonetheless.

1773
01:51:51,730 --> 01:51:54,490
And I'm telling you,
Mr. Bose is never alone.

1774
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:58,170
Is your Darbari Lal in love
with Bose or what?

1775
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:01,820
You tell him to shut up now.
We'll send Figgs to Incheon.

1776
01:52:01,910 --> 01:52:03,580
And just to be on the safe side,

1777
01:52:03,830 --> 01:52:06,160
keep an eye on anyone
Bose might get in touch with.

1778
01:52:06,530 --> 01:52:07,840
We've got it covered, sir.

1779
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:10,770
Anyone Bose may try and contact
is under surveillance.

1780
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:12,000
Excellent.

1781
01:52:12,090 --> 01:52:13,230
That'll be all!

1782
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:21,590
Get me Figgs.

1783
01:52:22,410 --> 01:52:25,270
Emilie, I don't know whether
you believe in this or not.

1784
01:52:26,610 --> 01:52:28,570
But people say, Bose is alive.

1785
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:33,100
They are not liking it, aren't they?

1786
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:38,850
Maybe that's why,
I'm still being watched.

1787
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:39,940
Watched?

1788
01:52:40,970 --> 01:52:41,780
By whom?

1789
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:44,250
And since when is this going on?

1790
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:48,650
Dr. Mathur, if you were
careful enough...

1791
01:52:49,110 --> 01:52:52,470
you would see that, probably,
you're being watched too.

1792
01:52:54,510 --> 01:52:55,410
Why?

1793
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:58,170
Is Bose alive?

1794
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:01,570
You see...

1795
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:06,270
You can't spy on dead people.

1796
01:53:08,590 --> 01:53:10,940
How have you been dealing
with this all alone?

1797
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:14,930
He trained me well.

1798
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:16,760
Write to me in German.

1799
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:19,710
Our British friends read
your letters before I read them.

1800
01:53:20,410 --> 01:53:22,680
It's been more than three years
since I saw you.

1801
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:25,150
Do you not miss me?

1802
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:28,270
I've sent you a picture of myself.

1803
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:31,870
It's a Bengali dress called kurta.

1804
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,700
Uncle, what did your friend say?

1805
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,210
She writes that the sleeves
should be shorter.

1806
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:47,570
Who wants your sleeves to be shorter?

1807
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:49,540
It's understood.

1808
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:53,730
She wants you to
extend your arms and...

1809
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:56,440
She's obviously talking
about the kurta.

1810
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,760
I want some bangles.

1811
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:04,550
Pack a kilo of bangles for Subhash.

1812
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:08,260
Stop joking and ward evil off him.

1813
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:11,640
Subhash, whom are you sending
these bangles to?

1814
01:54:11,730 --> 01:54:14,440
She's the one who writes to him.

1815
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:17,780
One needs a pen to write letters, right?

1816
01:54:17,870 --> 01:54:20,990
-Not bangles!
-They don't sell bangles in Vienna.

1817
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:22,180
So, she has asked for them.

1818
01:54:22,270 --> 01:54:24,740
Even you aren't in Vienna
right now, are you?

1819
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:26,230
Hasn't she asked for you?

1820
01:54:28,810 --> 01:54:32,560
Is she the one who looked after you
after your surgery?

1821
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:34,280
Mr. Bose!

1822
01:54:34,830 --> 01:54:36,510
-Mr. Bose, come with me.
-What's wrong?

1823
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:38,620
They are conducting meetings
without your knowledge.

1824
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:40,260
-Please come with me.
-Okay.

1825
01:54:41,070 --> 01:54:42,190
Dear God...

1826
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:45,720
The Congress party has its own
ideals and rules to follow.

1827
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:50,050
And every party worker should
abide by those rules and regulations.

1828
01:54:50,850 --> 01:54:53,730
If a party worker disobeys these rules,

1829
01:54:54,150 --> 01:54:56,880
then the party won't tolerate
such behavior.

1830
01:55:14,060 --> 01:55:15,170
Subhash...

1831
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:18,030
Nehru, I'm the president of the Congress.

1832
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:20,790
We all have to follow the rules,
don't we?

1833
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:24,830
You should have at least informed
me about the meeting.

1834
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:30,220
Any association with
Hitler is just wrong.

1835
01:55:30,970 --> 01:55:33,220
The Congress is upset with
your behavior!

1836
01:55:33,670 --> 01:55:35,420
Did I speak of any association?

1837
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:40,030
Nehru, we need a deadly weapon
to deal with the British.

1838
01:55:40,710 --> 01:55:42,130
And Hitler is that weapon.

1839
01:55:42,330 --> 01:55:43,300
Hitler?

1840
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:47,970
Well, he believes Indians are inferiors
like the Jews and Africans!

1841
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:49,780
Such a strange weapon you've chosen!

1842
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:53,010
A weapon is only as good as the
character of its wielder.

1843
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:55,790
Hitler is a murderer, Bose.

1844
01:55:57,790 --> 01:56:00,190
What about the British?
What would you call them?

1845
01:56:01,570 --> 01:56:04,420
They didn't kill anyone, did they?

1846
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:08,630
For years, they slaughtered us
right in our homeland.

1847
01:56:09,620 --> 01:56:11,320
What's the difference between
the British and Hitler?

1848
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:16,140
Bapu won't go with this
nor will the Congress.

1849
01:56:16,910 --> 01:56:18,560
I can't ever agree to this.

1850
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:21,110
It will be only your decision.

1851
01:56:21,770 --> 01:56:24,160
Indians will fight World War Two
for the British.

1852
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:26,930
Bapu made this decision on his own.

1853
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:28,930
Did he ask us?

1854
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:30,730
Did he ask Indians?

1855
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:33,010
-Bapu believed...
-Did he ask the soldiers?

1856
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:38,240
Bapu believes the British would agree to
our demands in return for our support.

1857
01:56:39,790 --> 01:56:43,120
To fight for the British
and to put our lives at stake

1858
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:45,820
is that what you call
nonviolence, Nehru?

1859
01:56:47,470 --> 01:56:49,040
A piece of advice for you.

1860
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:52,140
Ask Bapu to reason with the British

1861
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:55,410
to win World War Two
with nonviolence.

1862
01:56:56,410 --> 01:57:00,610
Why just the British? Ask him to
teach Hitler about nonviolence.

1863
01:57:01,990 --> 01:57:04,250
Why is nonviolence only
applicable to Indians?

1864
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:08,960
Nonviolence will never help you
win every battle.

1865
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:12,980
Subhash...

1866
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:16,560
Gandhiji and Nehru
refused to support Netaji.

1867
01:57:17,050 --> 01:57:18,640
But Bose wouldn't give up
so easily.

1868
01:57:18,830 --> 01:57:21,890
In 1939, he resigned from the Congress

1869
01:57:21,980 --> 01:57:27,000
and formed his own party,
All India Forward Bloc.

1870
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:28,960
Hail Bose!

1871
01:57:32,610 --> 01:57:37,990
Brothers and sisters,
we have started the war for freedom

1872
01:57:38,610 --> 01:57:43,860
and we will continue our war
till we achieve complete freedom.

1873
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:46,980
The faster we forget our personal issues

1874
01:57:47,070 --> 01:57:49,600
and come together to be a part
of this war,

1875
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:52,280
the faster, we'll achieve freedom!

1876
01:57:52,870 --> 01:57:55,490
It's time to sacrifice yourself.

1877
01:57:55,770 --> 01:57:57,700
The war bugle might sound anytime.

1878
01:57:58,870 --> 01:58:00,920
The situation is conducive for us
right now.

1879
01:58:02,030 --> 01:58:04,740
We have to take advantage of what's
happening in the world right now.

1880
01:58:05,050 --> 01:58:07,070
We've been exploited for centuries

1881
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:10,730
and we're struggling
to escape this crushing poverty.

1882
01:58:11,150 --> 01:58:13,260
We're struggling to provide
a decent meal for our population.

1883
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:17,870
Freedom is the only surefire way
to rid ourselves of this malaise

1884
01:58:18,490 --> 01:58:20,780
which in turn hinges on
our national unity.

1885
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:26,220
To be weak right now
is the greatest sin possible.

1886
01:58:26,650 --> 01:58:29,380
Slavery is the root of all problems!

1887
01:58:30,350 --> 01:58:32,910
It's about time when all of us

1888
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:36,470
should break the shackles of slavery.

1889
01:58:37,470 --> 01:58:40,000
All of you must come together

1890
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:43,240
and cry revolt in unison!

1891
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:47,340
India won't be a slave anymore.

1892
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:52,860
There is no power in the world
that can keep us enslaved!

1893
01:58:54,820 --> 01:58:55,890
Of course,

1894
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:58,630
we must pay a price to achieve freedom.

1895
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:03,630
All of you, I mean, all of you
must be prepared for this mission.

1896
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:07,820
We were born in enslaved India,

1897
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:13,540
but we shall live and die in free India!

1898
01:59:13,630 --> 01:59:15,300
Long live the revolution!

1899
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:18,870
Long live the revolution!

1900
01:59:19,170 --> 01:59:21,120
Hail Mr. Bose!

1901
01:59:21,210 --> 01:59:23,160
Hail Mr. Bose!

1902
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:25,010
Hail Mr. Bose!

1903
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:28,360
"This adroit voyager"

1904
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:33,020
"for the love of his land"

1905
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:37,370
"will head back home!"

1906
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,660
"This adroit voyager...."

1907
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:03,990
The police were here.

1908
02:00:04,730 --> 02:00:07,020
They came and left!

1909
02:00:07,110 --> 02:00:09,230
-Where are they now?
-In Incheon.

1910
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:12,950
"will head back home!"

1911
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,310
Okay, what about Mr. Bose?

1912
02:00:15,930 --> 02:00:17,110
Russia!

1913
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:17,160
Where's Bose?

1914
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:21,590
Dead!

1915
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:24,190
[Stanley]This is ridiculous!

1916
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:26,450
Bose played us.

1917
02:01:26,820 --> 02:01:28,060
How could we miss this?

1918
02:01:28,150 --> 02:01:30,550
Of course, he went to Russia.
Obviously Russia!

1919
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:32,050
Why would he go to Incheon?

1920
02:01:45,230 --> 02:01:47,220
I think, we made a mistake again.

1921
02:01:47,430 --> 02:01:49,360
Everything happened right
in front of our eyes.

1922
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:51,170
I tried to warn you earlier,

1923
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:55,340
even if a wise man is tired or wounded,
he's wise, nonetheless.

1924
02:01:55,950 --> 02:01:57,280
He remains wise!

1925
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,510
Mr. Bose has made a fool out of us.

1926
02:02:02,350 --> 02:02:03,710
It wasn't
for the first time though.

1927
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:08,100
Four years ago, he used the same
trick and made a fool out of us.

1928
02:02:09,230 --> 02:02:11,760
Tired with Bose's relentless tactics,
the British

1929
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:13,800
kept him under house arrest

1930
02:02:14,070 --> 02:02:16,820
and I was asked to man the door.

1931
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:22,550
Excuse me, ma'am.

1932
02:02:23,590 --> 02:02:24,940
Let me carry that for you.

1933
02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:28,080
-No, it's okay. I'll do it.
-No, don't trouble yourself.

1934
02:02:28,170 --> 02:02:30,490
-Don't bother.
-It won't be a problem.

1935
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:32,490
Very good! Come on.

1936
02:02:52,420 --> 02:02:55,370
[Subhash]Mother, I've made up my mind.
I'm going to retire.

1937
02:02:56,080 --> 02:02:58,950
You're thinking of retirement.
How about getting married?

1938
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,300
Or starting a family?

1939
02:03:00,390 --> 02:03:02,850
Start my family, eh? In India?

1940
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:06,840
You want me to raise kids
as slaves for the British?

1941
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,530
Mr. Bose, you're not the only one
fighting for freedom.

1942
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:12,900
There are so many people.
Gandhiji, Mr. Nehru.

1943
02:03:12,990 --> 02:03:15,090
Mr. Rajendra and they all are married,
by the way.

1944
02:03:15,610 --> 02:03:18,560
Who says only unmarried men
should fight for freedom?

1945
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:21,980
The problem with you
is that you're always in a hurry.

1946
02:03:22,070 --> 02:03:23,520
We'll achieve freedom eventually.

1947
02:03:23,610 --> 02:03:25,900
But you want freedom right away.

1948
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:29,250
Why? Mr. Bose, stop being childish.

1949
02:03:29,890 --> 02:03:31,790
From now on, I'll have only one meal.

1950
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:36,220
Although, it'll take a while
to quit smoking. But...

1951
02:03:36,900 --> 02:03:37,900
This...

1952
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:46,650
You've been abroad.
Didn't you find anyone?

1953
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:02,830
[Darbari]Won't you eat this?

1954
02:04:05,130 --> 02:04:06,340
Fine, I am eating it.

1955
02:04:20,290 --> 02:04:22,380
[Darbari]These days, he is busy meditating.

1956
02:04:22,910 --> 02:04:24,400
He doesn't talk to anyone.

1957
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:28,210
Now that doesn't make sense.

1958
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:30,040
Why would Bose retire now?

1959
02:04:30,590 --> 02:04:32,940
Maybe you've finally managed
to break him down.

1960
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:36,250
Darbari Lal, I want you
on the job 24 hours.

1961
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:39,130
Sir, I know the house
like the back of my hand.

1962
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:41,640
I'll be the first to know
if anything goes wrong.

1963
02:04:43,730 --> 02:04:44,700
Very good.

1964
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:48,860
[Darbari]Can I take a banana?

1965
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:52,500
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

1966
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:08,760
This dhoti is worn while offering prayers.
Are your hands clean?

1967
02:05:08,850 --> 02:05:10,700
My hands are pure. Check yourself.

1968
02:05:13,540 --> 02:05:15,130
May I ask you something?

1969
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:16,850
Sure, go ahead.

1970
02:05:17,730 --> 02:05:19,570
Why are you still unmarried?

1971
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:22,840
I don't know what to say.
I blame Mr. Bose for it.

1972
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:26,280
I'm too busy chasing Mr. Bose
to get married.

1973
02:05:27,490 --> 02:05:29,950
He doesn't stay put in one place.
He's a nuisance.

1974
02:05:30,510 --> 02:05:34,360
The day he mends his ways,
I swear, I'll get married.

1975
02:05:34,450 --> 02:05:36,140
I'm desperate to get married.

1976
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:39,200
I don't know what's wrong with Subhash.

1977
02:05:40,390 --> 02:05:42,260
He feels utterly depressed.

1978
02:05:45,170 --> 02:05:46,270
Tell me something.

1979
02:05:47,610 --> 02:05:51,080
Is Mr. Bose planning something?
Did he tell you about it?

1980
02:05:52,470 --> 02:05:55,880
We can't ask him that now.
He's taken a vow of silence.

1981
02:05:57,460 --> 02:05:59,030
He doesn't talk to anyone.

1982
02:06:05,850 --> 02:06:07,590
-[Darbari]Sir.
-[Stanley]What?

1983
02:06:08,330 --> 02:06:10,350
Mr. Bose has taken a vow of silence.

1984
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:12,680
Really?

1985
02:06:12,770 --> 02:06:15,480
Stanley, can we go one evening
without talking about Bose?

1986
02:06:15,570 --> 02:06:17,560
He's under house arrest
for God's sake.

1987
02:06:17,650 --> 02:06:20,240
Finally, I muzzled the rabid dog.

1988
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:22,740
Make sure he never leaves that house.

1989
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:24,810
Yes, sir.

1990
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:08,280
[Darbari]Listen, clean my ears so thoroughly

1991
02:07:08,370 --> 02:07:11,470
that I'd be able to hear
Mr. Bose's heartbeat.

1992
02:07:18,770 --> 02:07:20,160
[Darbari]Be careful.

1993
02:07:25,340 --> 02:07:28,160
[Man]Mister, please turn your head
this way.

1994
02:07:28,930 --> 02:07:33,110
Or the oil will block
your ear canal.

1995
02:07:33,770 --> 02:07:36,010
"To be free. Be free."

1996
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:38,580
"This is my destiny."

1997
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:41,140
"To be free. Be free."

1998
02:07:41,590 --> 02:07:43,740
"This is my destiny."

1999
02:07:43,980 --> 02:07:46,290
"To be free. Be free."

2000
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:48,920
"This is my destiny."

2001
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:51,580
"To be free. Be free."

2002
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:54,150
"This is my destiny."

2003
02:07:57,330 --> 02:07:58,910
"I hold a machine gun."

2004
02:07:59,940 --> 02:08:01,600
"I hold a machine gun."

2005
02:08:02,330 --> 02:08:04,230
"Beware Imperialists!"

2006
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:07,040
-"Keep walking...
-Gun, Gun."

2007
02:08:07,610 --> 02:08:09,400
-"Don't turn...
-Gun, Gun."

2008
02:08:10,050 --> 02:08:11,780
-"Or you...
-Gun, gun!"

2009
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:13,930
"Will burn..."

2010
02:08:14,790 --> 02:08:17,800
The entire family colluded
in helping Mr. Bose escape.

2011
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:20,150
While I was having my ears cleaned,

2012
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:24,260
his nephew Aurobindo
took Mr. Bose's place.

2013
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:27,830
"...free. This is my destiny."

2014
02:08:57,720 --> 02:09:01,190
[Darbari]Mr. Bose, the guava is quite ripe.
Care for some?

2015
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:15,590
I've left some guavas
for you outside, do take it.

2016
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:17,240
I'll post the letter and be back.

2017
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:31,790
[Darbari]The silence is deafening.

2018
02:09:32,460 --> 02:09:35,540
I can't believe Mr. Bose
has taken a vow of silence.

2019
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:38,310
After all, his speeches roused the nation
not so long ago.

2020
02:09:40,410 --> 02:09:43,020
Nowadays, he neither speaks
nor does he meet anyone.

2021
02:09:44,130 --> 02:09:45,900
Is he into meditative
consciousness?

2022
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:47,540
Should I break the door?

2023
02:09:47,630 --> 02:09:51,890
Well, I can smell cigarette smoke
and hear music from the lighter.

2024
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:54,850
It assures me
that that everything's fine.

2025
02:09:55,710 --> 02:09:57,030
[Man]Bibhavati!

2026
02:09:57,620 --> 02:09:58,990
Yes, I'm coming.

2027
02:10:00,690 --> 02:10:02,360
-[Man]Bibhavati!
-In a minute.

2028
02:10:05,650 --> 02:10:07,730
This charade continued for ten days.

2029
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:10,670
Mr. Bose wouldn't meet anyone,

2030
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:15,080
but the cigarette smoke,
music from the lighter

2031
02:10:15,170 --> 02:10:17,540
and the constant flow of letters
assured me

2032
02:10:17,630 --> 02:10:19,140
that beast was in control!

2033
02:10:21,350 --> 02:10:24,110
But, Mr. Bose had
already reached Peshawar.

2034
02:10:42,370 --> 02:10:43,540
Put your gun down.

2035
02:10:44,230 --> 02:10:46,050
Your German friends have sent me.

2036
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:55,480
-Subhash.
-Rahmat Khan.

2037
02:11:15,370 --> 02:11:16,480
Sir.

2038
02:11:17,650 --> 02:11:20,050
Royal Bengal Tiger has passed
through the checkpoint B.

2039
02:11:20,140 --> 02:11:22,840
Reaching checkpoint C in next two days.
Activate your group.

2040
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:34,340
Thank you.

2041
02:11:35,940 --> 02:11:38,410
Every second face you see here
is a British spy.

2042
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:43,210
In India, they call me Bhagat Singh Talvar
but here, just call me Rahmat Khan.

2043
02:11:44,770 --> 02:11:47,560
Rahmat, I want to get to Russia.
As soon as possible.

2044
02:11:49,680 --> 02:11:51,810
-Who's in Russia?
-No one.

2045
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:53,270
So?

2046
02:11:54,690 --> 02:11:56,930
Russia will help us fight
against the British.

2047
02:11:57,640 --> 02:11:59,750
After all, Russia won its freedom
through a revolution.

2048
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:03,440
But Gandhiji wants us to wait.

2049
02:12:03,580 --> 02:12:05,090
How long do we have to be patient?

2050
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:07,590
So for the next hundred years,

2051
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:10,700
or thousand years, if the British aren't
satisfied with nonviolence and patience,

2052
02:12:11,140 --> 02:12:13,300
then are we supposed to do
only protests?

2053
02:12:15,810 --> 02:12:18,170
Mr. Bose, we should leave.

2054
02:12:18,570 --> 02:12:21,390
Just keep walking straight and
don't look back. See you later.

2055
02:12:26,330 --> 02:12:27,510
Hello, officer.

2056
02:12:44,190 --> 02:12:45,140
[Darbari]Hey!

2057
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:56,740
Where's Bose?

2058
02:13:14,260 --> 02:13:16,830
He's made all of us
look like fools, Stanley!

2059
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:18,540
This is despicable!

2060
02:13:20,710 --> 02:13:21,630
Find him!

2061
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:24,010
Ten days had passed till
we found out

2062
02:13:24,100 --> 02:13:27,130
that Mr. Bose had broken house arrest
and vanished into thin air.

2063
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:29,950
[Darbari]Sir, I was manning the door.

2064
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:36,130
I feel like slapping myself right now.

2065
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:46,400
[Man]He ran away!

2066
02:13:48,180 --> 02:13:50,530
Just wait and watch.

2067
02:13:50,620 --> 02:13:54,760
The British didn't know how
to trace Mr. Bose.

2068
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:57,810
But the British were certain
of one thing

2069
02:13:57,900 --> 02:13:59,750
that Bose hadn't gotten far away.

2070
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:04,010
If he wanted to get out of India,
he had to cross the borders.

2071
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:08,310
Passport, please!

2072
02:14:12,270 --> 02:14:13,690
Are you from India?

2073
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:22,600
Once we're through this,
you'll be close to your destination.

2074
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:27,420
Once you cross the Indian border,

2075
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:30,110
that's like half the job done.

2076
02:14:31,550 --> 02:14:33,610
You'll run into a few
British officers at the border.

2077
02:14:34,530 --> 02:14:37,510
You will have to answer them
very carefully.

2078
02:14:38,080 --> 02:14:39,700
Mr. Bose, do you understand?

2079
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:43,570
Why don't you say anything, Mr. Bose?

2080
02:14:55,070 --> 02:14:56,290
Passports, please.

2081
02:15:03,740 --> 02:15:04,970
Go on.

2082
02:15:09,230 --> 02:15:10,720
Passport, please!

2083
02:15:17,130 --> 02:15:18,190
Who's he?

2084
02:15:18,890 --> 02:15:20,140
He's my brother.

2085
02:15:20,700 --> 02:15:22,830
Cat got his tongue?

2086
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:25,620
Let him speak for himself.
What is your name?

2087
02:15:28,460 --> 02:15:31,770
He can't speak, sir.
He lost his voice in an accident.

2088
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:34,760
I'm taking him
to the tomb of Adasharif.

2089
02:15:35,770 --> 02:15:37,370
It's really unfortunate, brother.

2090
02:15:37,810 --> 02:15:40,430
All right.
Adasharif will make everything right.

2091
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:41,820
-God willing!
-God willing!

2092
02:15:41,910 --> 02:15:43,020
Hold on a minute.

2093
02:15:43,830 --> 02:15:45,350
Will you leave them without checking?

2094
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:47,330
What if he's lying?

2095
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:52,190
Open your mouth and show me your tongue.

2096
02:15:54,590 --> 02:15:57,670
Oh no. All right, off you go.

2097
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:05,040
Poor guy's got a twisted tongue.
No way he'll ever talk.

2098
02:16:05,770 --> 02:16:08,870
21st January, 1945.

2099
02:16:11,030 --> 02:16:13,980
Subhash Chandra Bose has fled the country

2100
02:16:14,490 --> 02:16:15,820
to Afghanistan.

2101
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:20,570
We don't know what he looks like,

2102
02:16:20,660 --> 02:16:23,330
so we have a difficult task ahead of us.

2103
02:16:42,210 --> 02:16:45,010
Both, Mr. Bose and you have
a scheming mind.

2104
02:16:46,130 --> 02:16:47,380
Don't lose hope.

2105
02:16:47,470 --> 02:16:50,080
Mr. Bose doesn't know the local language.

2106
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:52,390
How far can he go?

2107
02:16:56,760 --> 02:16:57,900
Mr. Bose.

2108
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:00,770
I'm trying to get in touch with
the Russian Ambassador.

2109
02:17:01,370 --> 02:17:03,950
But it seems a bit difficult.

2110
02:17:05,310 --> 02:17:07,290
Had it been easy,
would I need your help?

2111
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:10,070
Keep trying...

2112
02:17:20,690 --> 02:17:21,680
Police.

2113
02:17:23,530 --> 02:17:26,030
-[Man]Open the door.
-[Rahmat]Yes, I'm coming.

2114
02:17:31,860 --> 02:17:33,530
Yes, I'm coming.

2115
02:17:40,710 --> 02:17:42,810
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you.

2116
02:17:43,630 --> 02:17:44,690
Is everything fine?

2117
02:17:44,970 --> 02:17:47,410
Hold on. Who is this man?

2118
02:17:47,870 --> 02:17:51,090
He is my brother and
he's attending a wedding.

2119
02:17:52,730 --> 02:17:53,850
What's your name?

2120
02:17:55,630 --> 02:17:58,060
He can't speak.

2121
02:18:06,460 --> 02:18:07,830
Is everything all right?

2122
02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:12,480
It's all clear here.
Let's check the next motel.

2123
02:18:25,020 --> 02:18:27,900
Since he's your family member,
I must take good care of him.

2124
02:18:29,570 --> 02:18:31,000
You're one of us now.

2125
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:36,780
No one can harm you till you are here.

2126
02:18:38,940 --> 02:18:40,200
I'll be seeing you again.

2127
02:18:46,830 --> 02:18:48,470
It's not a safe place to be.

2128
02:18:49,660 --> 02:18:52,140
Especially, when you're
wearing an expensive watch.

2129
02:19:04,100 --> 02:19:05,120
Goodbye.

2130
02:19:05,930 --> 02:19:07,030
Goodbye.

2131
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:13,790
Corrupt! Every single policeman
in the world.

2132
02:19:15,270 --> 02:19:18,900
You must meet the ambassador
at any cost. It's been long.

2133
02:19:18,990 --> 02:19:20,790
Mr. Bose, I'm trying my best.

2134
02:19:20,880 --> 02:19:22,300
I'm sure, I'll meet him today.

2135
02:19:24,410 --> 02:19:27,750
What if they won't let you
inside the Russian Embassy even this time?

2136
02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:29,730
I'll get hold of him outside.

2137
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:31,810
Time's running out, Rahmat.

2138
02:19:32,950 --> 02:19:34,080
Listen.

2139
02:19:34,870 --> 02:19:38,310
Explain to him
that I must meet Stalin.

2140
02:19:38,870 --> 02:19:40,950
We won't be successful
without Russia's help.

2141
02:19:41,260 --> 02:19:44,740
I understand it very well, Mr. Bose.
You've said it many times. Shall we?

2142
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:01,170
Rahmat.

2143
02:20:11,150 --> 02:20:12,150
You spoke to him?

2144
02:20:15,440 --> 02:20:16,450
He disagreed.

2145
02:20:17,940 --> 02:20:20,040
I think, the British have brainwashed him.

2146
02:20:20,650 --> 02:20:24,390
The Russian ambassador thinks
you're a British spy.

2147
02:20:25,950 --> 02:20:26,930
A British spy?

2148
02:20:27,690 --> 02:20:30,830
Where do they get their information?
Do I look like a spy?

2149
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:34,420
Mr. Bose.

2150
02:20:34,750 --> 02:20:36,940
I think you have to leave this place.

2151
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:38,930
There's nothing here.

2152
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:43,260
If the British catch you,
everything will be ruined.

2153
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:47,750
Now you have just one option.

2154
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:49,680
Germany.

2155
02:21:11,540 --> 02:21:13,440
[Rahmat]The Italians have arranged
for your passport.

2156
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:16,880
I hope Hitler agrees to meet you.

2157
02:21:18,910 --> 02:21:20,620
Mr. Bose...

2158
02:21:20,980 --> 02:21:22,570
You have kept the revolution alive.

2159
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:26,080
It doesn't matter if you take help from
Russia or Germany.

2160
02:21:55,570 --> 02:22:00,470
While Mr. Bose was ready to travel
to Germany on his Italian passport

2161
02:22:00,670 --> 02:22:04,910
Stanley's obsession with Bose
refused to die down.

2162
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,880
After all, Mr. Bose had vanished
right under their noses!

2163
02:22:09,330 --> 02:22:10,830
The British were bound to be dejected.

2164
02:22:26,730 --> 02:22:28,640
I'm sorry, it took me a while to come back.

2165
02:22:57,790 --> 02:23:00,240
I really thought
you're never going to come back.

2166
02:23:00,890 --> 02:23:02,760
I'm sorry, I couldn't write to you enough.

2167
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:06,660
But, I've read all your letters,
several times.

2168
02:23:07,740 --> 02:23:10,970
Look at you, you didn't change!

2169
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:14,440
I've lost a little bit of weight, I think.

2170
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:19,090
-Or maybe, you've put on some.
-Some hair, for sure.

2171
02:23:22,210 --> 02:23:23,870
I've got something for you.

2172
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:30,120
-What is that?
-Open it.

2173
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:42,220
You didn't forget.

2174
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:45,390
I never forget.

2175
02:24:00,770 --> 02:24:03,520
Subhash, I really don't think
this is a great move.

2176
02:24:06,280 --> 02:24:09,270
You know that Hitler is against
inter-racial marriages.

2177
02:24:10,870 --> 02:24:13,210
The British are already against you.

2178
02:24:14,730 --> 02:24:17,850
You might upset Hitler
with your marriage.

2179
02:24:17,940 --> 02:24:19,290
Just give it a thought.

2180
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:23,750
Being slaves for the British
wasn't enough

2181
02:24:24,430 --> 02:24:25,980
that you want us to
be slaves for Hitler, too?

2182
02:24:29,780 --> 02:24:32,270
I'm getting married tomorrow
and you're coming.

2183
02:25:30,980 --> 02:25:33,780
[Speaking German]

2184
02:25:36,140 --> 02:25:38,550
[Speaking German]

2185
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:40,700
Rassenschande.

2186
02:25:41,100 --> 02:25:43,660
A law imposed by Hitler

2187
02:25:44,010 --> 02:25:49,960
barred Germans from maintaining
any kind of relations with non-Germans.

2188
02:25:50,210 --> 02:25:51,710
[Speaking German]

2189
02:25:58,100 --> 02:25:59,490
[Speaking German]

2190
02:26:00,350 --> 02:26:03,110
This woman did not respect our rights!

2191
02:26:03,710 --> 02:26:04,870
She must be punished!

2192
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:20,420
A non-German who marries a German!

2193
02:26:41,660 --> 02:26:42,710
Are you okay?

2194
02:26:44,290 --> 02:26:46,510
Subhash, I'm pretty scared though.

2195
02:26:47,640 --> 02:26:48,730
Don't be.

2196
02:26:49,410 --> 02:26:50,510
I'm right here.

2197
02:26:52,670 --> 02:26:54,740
I wish I could take you to India
with me.

2198
02:26:57,330 --> 02:26:58,510
Very soon.

2199
02:26:59,150 --> 02:27:00,180
Okay?

2200
02:27:00,780 --> 02:27:01,960
Come. Let's go.

2201
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:04,560
Bose was the only man in Germany

2202
02:27:04,650 --> 02:27:07,550
who could have his way
without fearing anyone.

2203
02:27:08,290 --> 02:27:10,210
Bose and Emilie
flouted the Rassenschande law

2204
02:27:10,300 --> 02:27:12,430
and finally got married.

2205
02:27:12,690 --> 02:27:15,220
They had to pay a price
for their decision everyday.

2206
02:27:16,110 --> 02:27:18,630
Bose was not safe in Berlin

2207
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:20,790
and yet his presence in Berlin

2208
02:27:21,070 --> 02:27:24,710
posed a great threat to
the British in India.

2209
02:27:25,480 --> 02:27:27,160
What is Bose up to?

2210
02:27:27,490 --> 02:27:29,720
-In Berlin?
-No.

2211
02:27:30,610 --> 02:27:31,720
In India.

2212
02:27:31,990 --> 02:27:33,500
Is he back in India?

2213
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:35,240
Sir...

2214
02:27:35,730 --> 02:27:38,710
-I was about to tell you.
-What has he done now?

2215
02:27:41,860 --> 02:27:45,400
Come and you can hear for yourself.

2216
02:27:57,930 --> 02:28:00,240
I have a message for my fellow Indians.

2217
02:28:00,690 --> 02:28:03,840
Don't even think about volunteering
for the British Army.

2218
02:28:07,330 --> 02:28:09,790
They should leave the job
to the revolutionaries.

2219
02:28:10,820 --> 02:28:15,320
All these revolutionaries who are wearing
a British uniform,

2220
02:28:15,960 --> 02:28:18,100
but I'm sure
their heart bleeds for India.

2221
02:28:19,450 --> 02:28:21,310
When the day of freedom
finally dawns upon us,

2222
02:28:22,020 --> 02:28:25,950
the revolutionary should remember
and be ready to make the right choice.

2223
02:28:28,850 --> 02:28:29,940
Bloody hell!

2224
02:28:30,580 --> 02:28:31,960
He's preaching treason!

2225
02:28:32,050 --> 02:28:33,810
Our men are at the front line.

2226
02:28:34,310 --> 02:28:36,470
What if they are betrayed
by the Indians?

2227
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:38,290
Azad Hind Radio.

2228
02:28:38,380 --> 02:28:41,850
Bose was speaking from Germany to Indians

2229
02:28:42,150 --> 02:28:44,790
and every Indian could hear
Bose's speech.

2230
02:28:45,160 --> 02:28:49,390
The British were petrified
when they heard Bose's speech.

2231
02:28:49,740 --> 02:28:51,320
The news reached Delhi.

2232
02:28:51,640 --> 02:28:54,070
Viceroy was trembling in fear.

2233
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:57,580
In times of war, we must trust our troops.

2234
02:28:57,670 --> 02:29:01,580
The British officers depend on the
loyalty of these Indian soldiers.

2235
02:29:01,780 --> 02:29:05,530
Bose is inciting mutiny.
What are you doing about it?

2236
02:29:05,940 --> 02:29:07,950
We are working on it, Your Excellency.

2237
02:29:09,500 --> 02:29:13,300
Let me enlighten you.
You have failed miserably!

2238
02:29:13,710 --> 02:29:16,580
The British Secret Service
is taking over now.

2239
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:20,040
Extend to them all the help you can.

2240
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:22,740
Of course, Your Excellency!

2241
02:29:24,690 --> 02:29:26,580
Where is your younger, mute brother?

2242
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:28,870
He came to attend a
close relative's wedding, right?

2243
02:29:32,390 --> 02:29:33,730
Peter Fleming.

2244
02:29:34,170 --> 02:29:36,600
The most proficient officer of
the British Secret Service

2245
02:29:36,690 --> 02:29:38,280
was now assigned to catch Bose.

2246
02:29:38,370 --> 02:29:40,170
You've been going about this
the wrong way.

2247
02:29:40,820 --> 02:29:41,830
Watch me.

2248
02:29:45,300 --> 02:29:46,830
Bhagat Singh Talvar!

2249
02:29:47,160 --> 02:29:49,610
We know you helped Bose
to cross to Germany.

2250
02:29:50,490 --> 02:29:51,990
Who are you talking about?

2251
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:53,210
Don't lie!

2252
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:56,640
Did you know that Hitler was going to
attack Russia?

2253
02:29:56,950 --> 02:29:58,550
Germans won't do that!

2254
02:29:58,640 --> 02:30:00,770
Seems like your information is outdated.

2255
02:30:01,440 --> 02:30:04,180
This is going to happen
and it's going to happen soon.

2256
02:30:04,270 --> 02:30:07,750
And if you want it to stop, help us!

2257
02:30:08,230 --> 02:30:11,130
Why me? I am no traitor!

2258
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:13,600
The Germans have given you a transmitter

2259
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:16,490
through which you provide
all information.

2260
02:30:16,580 --> 02:30:18,340
Help us stop the fascists!

2261
02:30:18,780 --> 02:30:22,130
This is your chance to do something
for what you believe in.

2262
02:30:22,400 --> 02:30:23,690
They trust you.

2263
02:30:24,420 --> 02:30:26,780
And they will believe
whatever you tell them.

2264
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:30,410
Fleming was well aware
that Rahmat was loyal to Bose.

2265
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:35,510
But Rahmat was more loyal
to the communist revolution.

2266
02:30:35,650 --> 02:30:37,350
Has Bose met Hitler?

2267
02:30:39,420 --> 02:30:41,850
Bose and Hitler were about to meet.

2268
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:43,330
Hail Hitler!

2269
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:02,710
[Emilie] Do not speak to him as an equal.

2270
02:31:02,910 --> 02:31:04,990
He's the leader, the Führer!

2271
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:09,360
That means if you take any wrong step
it will lead to something really horrible!

2272
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:12,610
Please think again, are you...

2273
02:31:12,810 --> 02:31:14,820
really sure what you're doing?

2274
02:31:15,870 --> 02:31:17,950
Emilie, I know what he's doing
is horrible.

2275
02:31:18,280 --> 02:31:20,700
[Subhash] But if he agrees to help us
against the Britishers,

2276
02:31:21,220 --> 02:31:23,160
I don't mind going on the wrong side.

2277
02:31:23,980 --> 02:31:25,270
[Subhash] We need him.

2278
02:31:39,400 --> 02:31:40,610
Hail Hitler.

2279
02:31:42,980 --> 02:31:44,570
Hail Hitler.

2280
02:32:00,710 --> 02:32:01,890
Mr. Bose.

2281
02:32:02,570 --> 02:32:04,630
The Führer would see you now.

2282
02:32:05,070 --> 02:32:07,420
You should be careful of
what you say to him.

2283
02:32:07,890 --> 02:32:08,740
Are you ready?

2284
02:32:08,830 --> 02:32:10,790
I've had more than four months
to get ready.

2285
02:32:14,830 --> 02:32:15,980
Mr. Hitler.

2286
02:32:16,270 --> 02:32:17,590
So, Mr. Bose,

2287
02:32:17,900 --> 02:32:20,990
I have been very curious,
how did you know it wasn't me?

2288
02:32:21,580 --> 02:32:23,690
A fake Hitler has an image to maintain.

2289
02:32:24,170 --> 02:32:25,770
And a real one does not care.

2290
02:32:27,350 --> 02:32:30,050
The double seemed really offended
that I did not recognize him.

2291
02:32:30,860 --> 02:32:31,960
Thank you.

2292
02:32:34,590 --> 02:32:36,910
The British are right to worry about you.

2293
02:32:38,450 --> 02:32:40,970
How do you intend to
bring the empire down?

2294
02:32:41,410 --> 02:32:43,680
As all empires have been brought down
in history.

2295
02:32:44,210 --> 02:32:45,260
By an army.

2296
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:47,490
Where do you intend to get this army?

2297
02:32:48,420 --> 02:32:49,650
You have it right here.

2298
02:32:50,690 --> 02:32:54,050
Give me the Indian prisoners of war
and I will build an army.

2299
02:32:54,830 --> 02:32:57,240
How will you take them
all the way to India?

2300
02:32:58,500 --> 02:33:02,170
My plan is to march across Russia
and free India from the British.

2301
02:33:05,310 --> 02:33:08,010
And why would they be willing
to do this now

2302
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:11,170
when they have never thought of it,
until now?

2303
02:33:12,190 --> 02:33:14,280
Because until now,
they have never realized

2304
02:33:14,660 --> 02:33:15,900
they can!

2305
02:33:19,210 --> 02:33:23,240
Herr Bose, do you know what
Führer means in Hindi?

2306
02:33:28,090 --> 02:33:29,330
Yes, I do.

2307
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:32,010
The Hindi word for Führer
is Neta.

2308
02:33:32,650 --> 02:33:34,880
And Hitler called you Netaji!

2309
02:33:37,020 --> 02:33:39,710
Except for these soldiers
who flatly refused to do so.

2310
02:33:40,140 --> 02:33:43,170
They believe the Germans to be their
enemy and consider you to be their spy.

2311
02:33:45,610 --> 02:33:48,060
So these British loyalists
take me to be a German spy.

2312
02:33:49,660 --> 02:33:50,890
Now let's see

2313
02:33:51,180 --> 02:33:53,200
if these loyalists can listen to a spy.

2314
02:34:03,410 --> 02:34:04,320
Go.

2315
02:34:04,900 --> 02:34:06,330
Go and tell Hitler

2316
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:10,260
no matter what he tries,
he cannot break us.

2317
02:34:12,100 --> 02:34:13,570
No one will betray.

2318
02:34:14,430 --> 02:34:15,800
A lot of people have tried.

2319
02:34:16,850 --> 02:34:20,920
Mr. Bose, we are soldiers.

2320
02:34:22,350 --> 02:34:23,440
Not traitors.

2321
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:27,730
What would that make
Mangal Pandey then?

2322
02:34:28,830 --> 02:34:30,220
He was also a soldier.

2323
02:34:30,620 --> 02:34:31,520
Or was he a traitor?

2324
02:34:32,540 --> 02:34:33,850
This is not our battle.

2325
02:34:34,770 --> 02:34:37,630
We are akin to weapons.
Just like a revolver.

2326
02:34:38,570 --> 02:34:40,620
A revolver has neither a mission
nor a goal.

2327
02:34:41,620 --> 02:34:43,380
It's used by the one who wields it.

2328
02:34:43,650 --> 02:34:44,700
What do you mean?

2329
02:34:44,970 --> 02:34:47,590
-Do you want us to fight for Hitler?
-Not at all!

2330
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:49,880
I want all of you
to fight for yourself.

2331
02:34:50,470 --> 02:34:51,680
For your freedom.

2332
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:53,920
If we have to bleed for someone,
then let's bleed for India.

2333
02:34:54,170 --> 02:34:56,970
Let's be martyrs for India
and not for the British!

2334
02:34:58,680 --> 02:35:00,790
I'm not here to ask for your help.

2335
02:35:01,880 --> 02:35:04,160
India is your country
just as it is mine.

2336
02:35:04,810 --> 02:35:07,030
I'm here to ask for India's freedom.

2337
02:35:13,150 --> 02:35:15,770
If this works, we'll have Bose.

2338
02:35:16,110 --> 02:35:17,350
We already have him.

2339
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:19,700
Poor chap just doesn't know it yet.

2340
02:35:25,480 --> 02:35:27,820
Hail India, Mr. Bose,
Rahmat Khan here.

2341
02:35:27,910 --> 02:35:29,110
[Subhash] Hail India, Rahmat.

2342
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:31,810
The British are feeling
the heat of your resistance.

2343
02:35:32,100 --> 02:35:33,160
What's going on there?

2344
02:35:33,970 --> 02:35:36,200
[Subhash] Rahmat, we've built
an army here.

2345
02:35:36,630 --> 02:35:38,600
[Subhash] We'll be reaching
India soon.

2346
02:35:38,690 --> 02:35:41,660
How come you found an army in Germany?

2347
02:35:41,810 --> 02:35:45,030
[Subhash] The British left them to die,
but now they're my soldiers.

2348
02:35:45,910 --> 02:35:47,810
[Subhash] The Indian POWs.

2349
02:35:49,810 --> 02:35:50,960
Mr. Bose...

2350
02:35:54,300 --> 02:35:57,040
This can pose quite the problem for us.

2351
02:36:06,690 --> 02:36:09,510
In 1928, on the streets of Calcutta,

2352
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:12,060
Netaji marched with
2000 nominal soldiers.

2353
02:36:12,360 --> 02:36:15,300
Today he commanded an army.

2354
02:36:16,930 --> 02:36:21,480
Today, if Bose marches his army
into India...

2355
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:24,080
we can't stop him.

2356
02:36:25,880 --> 02:36:27,650
And neither can Congress.

2357
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:33,680
A person who seeks help from foreign
powers to attack India

2358
02:36:33,770 --> 02:36:36,370
is not an Indian, but a traitor.

2359
02:36:37,010 --> 02:36:38,400
If required,

2360
02:36:38,490 --> 02:36:42,200
I will be the person to
take the sword to Bose.

2361
02:36:43,100 --> 02:36:45,100
-Hail India!
-Hail India!

2362
02:36:45,190 --> 02:36:46,880
-Hail India!
-Hail India!

2363
02:36:46,970 --> 02:36:49,090
-[Nehru] Hail India!
-[Crowd] Hail India!

2364
02:36:49,180 --> 02:36:50,360
According to Talvar,

2365
02:36:50,450 --> 02:36:53,390
soldiers from Northern Africa
have also joined Netaji...

2366
02:36:55,070 --> 02:36:57,460
-I mean...
-That's the name he goes by nowadays?

2367
02:36:58,030 --> 02:36:59,360
Netaji!

2368
02:37:09,710 --> 02:37:11,180
Attention!

2369
02:37:14,340 --> 02:37:17,630
"You rule the minds of the people."

2370
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:20,600
"You are the dispenser
of India's destiny."

2371
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:24,500
"Your name rouses the hearts of
Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat, Maratha,"

2372
02:37:24,590 --> 02:37:27,680
"Dravid, Orissa and Bengal."

2373
02:37:27,770 --> 02:37:31,220
"Your name echoes in the hills
of the Vindhyas and Himalayas,"

2374
02:37:31,310 --> 02:37:34,260
"and it mingles in the music
of the Ganga and the Yamuna."

2375
02:37:34,350 --> 02:37:37,410
"We praise you, always."

2376
02:37:37,500 --> 02:37:40,790
"You give us life, always."

2377
02:37:40,880 --> 02:37:44,030
"You give hope to everyone."

2378
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:47,540
"You are the sun to the world"

2379
02:37:47,630 --> 02:37:50,500
"and bring fortune to the world."

2380
02:37:50,590 --> 02:37:52,160
"Victory to you!"

2381
02:37:52,250 --> 02:37:53,900
"Victory to you!"

2382
02:37:53,990 --> 02:37:57,230
"Victory to you!"

2383
02:37:57,320 --> 02:37:59,100
Hail India!

2384
02:38:02,590 --> 02:38:04,180
This battle has begun outside India

2385
02:38:04,430 --> 02:38:08,080
and soon it will be
fought inside India.

2386
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:13,260
You have to fight for your freedom,
nobody gives it to you.

2387
02:38:13,750 --> 02:38:17,090
We'll have to shed blood for
this freedom struggle. Our blood.

2388
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:19,890
The cost of our freedom
will be our blood.

2389
02:38:20,670 --> 02:38:22,380
India's freedom!

2390
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:24,640
Our country's freedom!

2391
02:38:25,360 --> 02:38:27,000
Give me blood,

2392
02:38:27,650 --> 02:38:29,270
and I shall give you freedom.

2393
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:32,190
Long live free India!

2394
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:34,250
Long live free India!

2395
02:38:34,340 --> 02:38:36,310
Long live free India!

2396
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:38,060
Move!

2397
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:48,870
"Sure."

2398
02:38:49,570 --> 02:38:52,160
"He knew what he was gonna do
He did what he wanted to."

2399
02:38:52,500 --> 02:38:57,220
It was the year 1946. It had been
a year since Netaji had disappeared.

2400
02:38:57,560 --> 02:39:01,520
Netaji had sparked the mutiny
amid the Indian soldiers

2401
02:39:01,700 --> 02:39:03,540
and it was spreading like
a wildfire.

2402
02:39:04,100 --> 02:39:09,070
The mutiny that started with
66 ships and 10,000 sailors

2403
02:39:09,160 --> 02:39:11,200
now began to spread
all over the nation.

2404
02:39:11,290 --> 02:39:14,450
"...and theirs would blot.
A dance with futility!"

2405
02:39:14,540 --> 02:39:16,320
"Broken down to its utility,"

2406
02:39:16,410 --> 02:39:18,050
"Together, how can we be?"

2407
02:39:18,140 --> 02:39:20,640
"But our weakness is unity."

2408
02:39:20,940 --> 02:39:24,080
After 1945, no one saw Netaji.

2409
02:39:24,270 --> 02:39:27,960
Even if Emilie knew, she didn't share
the information with anyone.

2410
02:39:28,050 --> 02:39:29,010
Emilie...

2411
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:32,460
-do you think Bose is...
-Dr. Mathur...

2412
02:39:32,860 --> 02:39:37,240
as I said, some people need to stay dead,
to stay alive.

2413
02:39:41,370 --> 02:39:43,760
Mr. Bose was never seen after that.

2414
02:39:43,950 --> 02:39:45,150
Whoever they saw

2415
02:39:45,480 --> 02:39:49,290
was he an imposter or real person?
The truth is still lost in the dark.

2416
02:39:49,980 --> 02:39:51,290
"Right, right, right."

2417
02:39:52,030 --> 02:39:53,420
"What I said is right."

2418
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:55,500
"Yes, yes, yes."

2419
02:39:55,740 --> 02:39:57,170
"I did what I had to."

2420
02:39:57,770 --> 02:40:01,090
"I burnt in a fire of protest
I had to."

2421
02:40:01,460 --> 02:40:04,640
"I threw stones at the establishment
I had to."

2422
02:40:05,210 --> 02:40:08,410
"I planted fear in the heart of my enemy
I had to - War!"

2423
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:10,240
I've got a telegram from Bose.

2424
02:40:10,330 --> 02:40:12,320
"...the war cry from the people
I did right."

2425
02:40:12,850 --> 02:40:14,520
"Never listened to warning signs"

2426
02:40:14,610 --> 02:40:16,410
"Couldn't be a slave to the British"

2427
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:20,690
"Never lost a fight.
History will be my story."

2428
02:40:20,780 --> 02:40:24,410
-"Bose!
-His actions faster than thought."

2429
02:40:24,550 --> 02:40:25,720
"Bose."

2430
02:40:26,350 --> 02:40:28,200
"They'd look for him where he was not."

2431
02:40:28,290 --> 02:40:29,490
"Bose."

2432
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:31,930
"Incapable of being caught."

2433
02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:33,500
"Bose."

2434
02:40:33,940 --> 02:40:36,050
"His lines were sharp
and theirs would blot."

2435
02:40:36,140 --> 02:40:37,270
"Bose."

2436
02:40:47,150 --> 02:40:49,380
-He's alive.
-Who?

2437
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:50,730
Bose.

2438
02:40:51,070 --> 02:40:52,920
It looks like he's hiding in Russia.

2439
02:40:53,380 --> 02:40:57,780
That's enough, I don't want to hear about
Bose anymore.

2440
02:40:58,220 --> 02:40:59,330
Done.

2441
02:41:03,090 --> 02:41:05,750
You want to talk about Bose? Now?

2442
02:41:06,900 --> 02:41:09,760
You do realize there is a mutiny
in the Navy.

2443
02:41:10,120 --> 02:41:12,280
Our own soldiers are turning against us.

2444
02:41:12,430 --> 02:41:14,060
The whole country's
up in arms, Stanley.

2445
02:41:14,150 --> 02:41:16,620
Exactly why we need to find Bose.

2446
02:41:16,710 --> 02:41:18,500
We are leaving this country.

2447
02:41:18,820 --> 02:41:20,490
We're finished with Bose.

2448
02:41:21,020 --> 02:41:22,600
-But, sir...
-It's enough!

2449
02:41:23,020 --> 02:41:24,750
Not another word, Stanley!

2450
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:27,470
Bose is dead.

2451
02:41:28,480 --> 02:41:30,130
He died in a plane crash.

2452
02:41:31,050 --> 02:41:32,390
End of story.

2453
02:41:43,790 --> 02:41:45,070
In 1966,

2454
02:41:45,240 --> 02:41:49,180
Lal Bahadur Shashtri had to
attend the historic Tashkent Peace Accord

2455
02:41:49,270 --> 02:41:50,890
in Tashkent, Russia.

2456
02:41:57,650 --> 02:41:58,890
"Sure."

2457
02:41:59,380 --> 02:42:02,060
"He knew what he was gonna do
He did what he wanted to"

2458
02:42:03,330 --> 02:42:06,300
"They tried to blame him
and couldn't contain him before."

2459
02:42:07,330 --> 02:42:10,280
"He took the fight to the top of
the line through the door."

2460
02:42:11,010 --> 02:42:12,200
"He disappeared..."

2461
02:42:12,290 --> 02:42:14,620
Please book a trunk call to India.

2462
02:42:15,070 --> 02:42:16,740
"His actions faster than thought."

2463
02:42:16,830 --> 02:42:18,510
"They'd look for him where he was not."

2464
02:42:18,700 --> 02:42:20,590
"Incapable of being caught."

2465
02:42:20,680 --> 02:42:22,690
"His lines were sharp
and theirs would blot"

2466
02:42:22,780 --> 02:42:24,220
"A dance with futility"

2467
02:42:24,580 --> 02:42:26,460
"Broken down to its utility."

2468
02:42:26,550 --> 02:42:28,210
"Together, how can we be?"

2469
02:42:28,300 --> 02:42:30,480
"When our weakness is unity."

2470
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:38,360
"It's difficult to..."

2471
02:42:38,450 --> 02:42:40,050
"It's difficult to..."

2472
02:42:40,140 --> 02:42:41,980
"It's difficult to..."

2473
02:42:42,070 --> 02:42:43,990
"It's difficult to understand Subhash."

2474
02:42:48,290 --> 02:42:51,280
-Hello.
-Sir, Darbari Lal here.

2475
02:42:52,510 --> 02:42:53,880
You were right.

2476
02:42:55,280 --> 02:42:56,530
Mr. Bose...

2477
02:42:56,890 --> 02:42:58,020
He is alive.

2478
02:42:58,270 --> 02:42:59,200
He's in Russia.

2479
02:42:59,290 --> 02:43:02,850
"Right, right, right.
What I said is right."

2480
02:43:03,270 --> 02:43:06,610
"Yes, yes, yes.
I did what I had to."

2481
02:43:07,190 --> 02:43:10,530
"I burnt in a fire of protest
I had to."

2482
02:43:10,850 --> 02:43:14,350
"I threw stones at the establishment
I had to."

2483
02:43:14,690 --> 02:43:17,000
"I planted fear
in the heart of my enemy..."

2484
02:43:17,090 --> 02:43:20,430
After meeting the President of Pakistan,
Ayub Khan, in Tashkent

2485
02:43:20,520 --> 02:43:24,650
and signing a peace accord that ended
the Indo-Pakistan war

2486
02:43:24,740 --> 02:43:27,430
on the night of 11th January, 1966,

2487
02:43:27,520 --> 02:43:30,150
Lal Bahadur Shastri died
under mysterious circumstances.

2488
02:43:30,240 --> 02:43:31,700
"Bose!"

2489
02:43:31,930 --> 02:43:33,710
"His actions faster than thoughts."

2490
02:43:33,860 --> 02:43:35,180
"Bose!"

2491
02:43:36,070 --> 02:43:39,360
Some stories don't really have an end.

2492
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:41,690
Netaji's story has an end,

2493
02:43:41,960 --> 02:43:43,820
but it's difficult to accept it.

2494
02:43:44,140 --> 02:43:47,070
Netaji's story, whenever told

2495
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:49,550
will force the listeners
to think hard

2496
02:43:49,860 --> 02:43:51,640
but the mystery behind
Netaji's death

2497
02:43:51,730 --> 02:43:53,140
will always remain a mystery.

2498
02:43:53,230 --> 02:43:54,590
"No paranoia of defeat."

2499
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:56,540
"Only sublime strategies of war."

2500
02:43:56,990 --> 02:44:00,170
