00:00:00,327 --> 00:00:01,164
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,164 --> 00:00:03,060
On 21st August 1911,

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,219
it was a Monday morning in the French capital, Paris.

4
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:07,721
It was quite bustling.

5
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:09,678
People were going to work in their offices

6
00:00:09,678 --> 00:00:13,928
when suddenly, three men came out of the Louvre museum.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,005
The three had spent the previous night in the museum. 

8
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:23,685
And now, they were carrying an 
important property of the Louvre Museum.

9
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:25,795
that was hidden in a blanket

10
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:26,737
while they tried to escape.

11
00:00:26,737 --> 00:00:28,760
They went to a nearby railway station

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,201
and caught the train at 8.45 in the morning

13
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:32,610
and disappeared.

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,456
The whole world was unaware of the fact that

15
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:37,609
they had stolen a painting.

16
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,531
Not an insignificant painting.

17
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:42,566
The world's most famous painting.

18
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:43,568
The Mona Lisa.

19
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:45,702
Today, the value of this painting

20
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:47,868
is close to $1 billion.

21
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:49,576
What is the reason behind this?

22
00:00:49,576 --> 00:00:52,837
What are the secrets hidden in the Mona Lisa?

23
00:00:52,837 --> 00:00:55,203
Why is this the most famous painting in the world?

24
00:00:55,203 --> 00:00:57,996
Let's understand the mystery of the Mona Lisa

25
00:00:57,996 --> 00:00:59,759
in today's video.

26
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:20,445
Mona Lisa was painted in 1503

27
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:23,488
by an Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci.

28
00:01:23,488 --> 00:01:25,913
And this man was so amazing,

29
00:01:25,913 --> 00:01:27,151
that you won't even believe it.

30
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:28,753
Not only was he a painter,

31
00:01:28,753 --> 00:01:31,102
but also an engineer, scientist,

32
00:01:31,102 --> 00:01:33,915
sculptor, architect, and theorist.

33
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:36,519
He had knowledge of so many subjects

34
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,348
be it painting, cartography,

35
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,433
astronomy, anatomy,

36
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,536
botany, hydrology,

37
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:46,650
geology, optics, or even palaeontology.

38
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,113
An entire video can be made on his life.

39
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:50,955
So, without talking about him too much,

40
00:01:50,955 --> 00:01:51,989
let's get to Mona Lisa.

41
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:54,659
Which was his most famous painting.

42
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,789
But who was this person in the painting?

43
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:01,319
People have always been curious about 
the identity of the woman in the painting.

44
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,629
The first revelation about this was made by

45
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:06,252
an Italian artist named Giorgio Vasari,

46
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:10,660
who wrote the autobiography 
of Leonardo da Vinci in 1550.

47
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,375
According to Vasari, this woman was

48
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,103
Lisa Gherardini.

49
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:17,949
She was married to a silk trader who lived in Florence,

50
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:19,462
Francesco Giocondo.

51
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:23,625
He believed that Francesco had 
commissioned this painting of his wife

52
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,555
and that's the origin of the names of this painting.

53
00:02:26,555 --> 00:02:28,411
The first name that we all know,

54
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:29,514
Mona Lisa,

55
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:31,156
derived from Madonna Lisa.

56
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:32,885
Traditionally, in Italian,

57
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:36,055
the word Madonna was used to mean Madam.

58
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,490
So, Madonna Lisa meant Madam Lisa.

59
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,696
The word Madonna was later shortened to Monna.

60
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:42,824
Monna with a double N.

61
00:02:42,824 --> 00:02:45,066
When this was written in English

62
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:46,558
an N was dropped

63
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:48,709
and Monna became Mona.

64
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,756
So Mona Lisa means

65
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:52,429
Madam Lisa or Lady Lisa.

66
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:54,565
And then comes Mona Lisa's other name

67
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:56,706
which is La Gioconda.

68
00:02:56,706 --> 00:02:58,671
After her marriage, Lisa Gherardini

69
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:00,485
became Lisa Giocondo.

70
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:03,897
Interestingly, in Italian, Giocondo means

71
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:06,289
light-hearted or cheerful.

72
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:07,826
Meaning, bright and joyful.

73
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:11,203
And today, Mona Lisa is very famous for her smile.

74
00:03:11,203 --> 00:03:12,853
So that's where it got its name,

75
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:13,917
La Giocondo.

76
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:16,608
In French, the word Giocondo is written with a J,

77
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,327
like this, Joconde.

78
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:21,734
So that's why when you go to the Louvre Museum in Paris

79
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,562
and see the painting of Mona Lisa,

80
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:26,184
in French, it would be identified as La Joconde.

81
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:27,649
Now, the interesting thing is that

82
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:29,765
in 1550, despite this revelation,

83
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:31,580
people were not ready to believe that

84
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,966
Vasari's narrative was correct.

85
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:35,568
Many theories started to emerge

86
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:37,717
about this woman being someone else.

87
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,064
Some people said that she 
was Leonardo da Vinci's mother.

88
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:44,659
Some said that this was a painting 
of a queen from the Italian aristocracy.

89
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,394
The most interesting theory was that

90
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:49,199
in this painting, da Vinci painted himself.

91
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,735
That this painting is not of a woman.

92
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:53,578
but in fact a self-portrait of Da Vinci.

93
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:55,685
Where he imagined

94
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,171
how he would have looked had he been a woman.

95
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:03,347
This theory was promoted by 
artist Lilian Schwartz in an article in 1987.

96
00:04:03,347 --> 00:04:05,285
She used digital tools to

97
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:07,491
try to show similarities between

98
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:09,571
Leonardo Da Vinci's face

99
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:11,233
and Mona Lisa's image.

100
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,364
With this logic, any two faces

101
00:04:13,364 --> 00:04:16,430
can be seen as similar by placing them on top of each other.

102
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,801
But today, we can say with a lot of certainty that

103
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,565
the woman painted here

104
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:22,315
is indeed Lisa Giocondo.

105
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:24,082
A professor living in Florence

106
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:26,435
researched this for 25 years

107
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:29,095
and found the archives

108
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:32,067
and in 2004, he discovered clear evidence

109
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,879
to prove this fact.

110
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,111
He also found that

111
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,938
the da Vinci family had a close relationship

112
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:39,945
with Francesco Giocondo's family.

113
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:42,012
He also found a record that

114
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:45,915
Lisa's marriage was registered on 5th March 1495

115
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:47,784
when Lisa was 16 years old

116
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:50,377
and Francesco was around 30 years old.

117
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:53,054
He found that Leonardo da Vinci's father

118
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:55,810
and Lisa's husband knew each other very well.

119
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,829
And it's possible that

120
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:02,459
this painting was commissioned not by Lisa's husband,

121
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,789
but by Leonardo's father.

122
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:06,089
Pallanti says that

123
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:07,916
when the Mona Lisa was painted,

124
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,214
Lisa was 24 years old.

125
00:05:10,214 --> 00:05:13,185
And that there might have been 
two reasons for painting this.

126
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:15,094
The first reason is that in 1503,

127
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:17,303
when Francesco and Lisa bought their home,

128
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:18,525
or the second reason is that

129
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:20,045
in December 1502,

130
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:21,886
when their second son was born.

131
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,728
The second reason seems more probable

132
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:26,213
because three years before this, in 1499,

133
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:27,923
Lisa lost her daughter.

134
00:05:27,923 --> 00:05:29,860
If you look at this painting closely,

135
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,891
you will see a veil over Lisa's hair.

136
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:36,196
Many people call it a mourning veil.

137
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:38,785
It is a veil that is worn when

138
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:41,081
someone in the family has passed away.

139
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:42,587
Now, one question arises here

140
00:05:42,587 --> 00:05:44,012
if Da Vinci was Italian,

141
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:45,425
Mona Lisa was Italian,

142
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,945
then why is this painting in France today?

143
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:49,246
Well, the thing about this is that

144
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:51,093
in the year 1516,

145
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:53,043
the king of France, King Francis I,

146
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:56,263
invited Leonardo da Vinci to live in France.

147
00:05:56,644 --> 00:05:59,581
And so, da Vinci moved from Italy to France.

148
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:02,461
And took with him the Mona Lisa.

149
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:05,522
Historical records aren't clear about this,

150
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:09,173
but it's believed that da Vinci 
hadn't completed the painting yet. 

151
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:11,390
15 years after starting the painting,

152
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,562
he was still working on this painting,

153
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:17,473
trying to modify it and make it better.

154
00:06:17,473 --> 00:06:19,431
Meanwhile, in the year 1519,

155
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:23,007
Leonardo da Vinci passed away
during his stay in the French palace.

156
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:28,104
And the king kept this painting 
as a part of his Royal Collection.

157
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:31,304
About 150 years, in 1797,

158
00:06:31,304 --> 00:06:32,757
when the French Revolution happened,

159
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:36,053
this painting was taken out of the palace

160
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:37,776
and handed over to the Louvre Museum.

161
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:40,515
I have made a separate video on the French Revolution

162
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:41,438
in case you haven't seen it yet,

163
00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:42,748
its link is in the description.

164
00:06:42,748 --> 00:06:44,157
The interesting thing is that

165
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:45,714
this is the reason why

166
00:06:45,714 --> 00:06:48,852
the Mona Lisa was stolen in 1911.

167
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:50,915
I had talked about this at the beginning of the video.

168
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:53,365
The mastermind of this theft was Vincenzo Peruggia.

169
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:56,447
He stole this painting together with his two friends.

170
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:59,056
He was an Italian Nationalist.

171
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:02,014
He believed that this painting belonged to Italy.

172
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:03,462
Not in France.

173
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:06,529
And so after stealing it, they took it to Italy.

174
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:09,206
Stealing such a famous painting was a risky job

175
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:12,510
especially when the value of 
the painting was in millions of dollars.

176
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,542
So, obviously, Vincenzo wouldn't have felt safe after this theft.

177
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:20,080
But if you want to feel safe and secure about your money

178
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,060
then consider stable investment options

179
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,418
like investing in fixed deposits.

180
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:30,711
In short, FDs, have been a safe and stable investment for years.

181
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:33,859
And the sponsor of this video
can help you a lot with this.

182
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,080
Stable Money.

183
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,383
Stable Money is an app

184
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:38,446
that revolutionises FD investments.

185
00:07:38,446 --> 00:07:43,432
You get access to information from more 
than 200 banks and financial institutions.

186
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:46,332
They have partnered with many banks and NBFCs,

187
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,218
you can see the interest rates of various banks,

188
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,776
and compare options.

189
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:52,940
And without creating an account in those banks,

190
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,413
you can invest money in 
the FDs of those banks through this app.

191
00:07:56,413 --> 00:07:58,746
The best thing is that the barrier to entry is very low.

You can check it out.

203
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:29,651
Now, let's get back to Vincenzo,

204
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:31,991
the Italian nationalist.

205
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:34,340
We will talk about what happens next later in the video.

206
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,152
But before that, let's know the speciality of this painting.

207
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:39,001
Why is it so special?

208
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,279
First of all,

209
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,138
the Mona Lisa was not painted on paper, canvas or cloth.

210
00:08:44,138 --> 00:08:48,052
Instead, it was painted on poplar wood.

211
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:51,464
In those days, it was the favourite wood of Italian painters.

212
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:55,140
Secondly, this painting isn't large.

213
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,376
Look at the photos.

214
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:58,153
This is where it hangs in the museum.

215
00:08:58,153 --> 00:09:00,806
You can see its size in comparison to the people.

216
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:04,844
This painting is only 77 cm by 53 cm.

217
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,338
But still, it is considered so special

218
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,142
because, in its time, in Italy,

219
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:10,961
this was the first painting

220
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:13,710
which focused so closely on the person.

221
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,247
This is a half-length portrait.

222
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:18,507
These types of shots are very common in photography today.

223
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:21,182
But no one used to make such paintings in those days.

224
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:23,564
If you look at the overall colour grading of this painting,

225
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,253
you will see a lot of brown and yellow shades. 
 
It looks like a very dull painting. It is so yellowish that at one point, a professor declared Lisa a cholesterol patient. But there are two reasons behind this. First, a varnish layer has been applied to this painting so that moisture does not affect the painting badly.

226
00:09:26,253 --> 00:09:27,993
It looks like a dull painting.

227
00:09:27,993 --> 00:09:30,555
It is so yellowish that once a professor

228
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:33,471
had declared Lisa to be a patient with high cholesterol.

229
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,566
But there are two reasons for this.

230
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:38,763
First, there is a layer of varnish on top of this painting.

231
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:42,393
So that there are no ill-effects of moisture on this painting,

232
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:44,853
since it was painted on wood.

233
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:47,673
So it's necessary to protect it from humidity and moisture.

234
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:49,235
And secondly,

235
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:51,878
over time, there was bleaching.

236
00:09:51,878 --> 00:09:53,468
Originally, when this was painted,

237
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,755
it used to be more bright and colourful.

238
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:57,674
Some people tried to recreate this painting

239
00:09:57,674 --> 00:09:59,990
to see how it would have looked originally.

240
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,734
Da Vinci used a very special painting style in this painting,

241
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:05,247
known as Sfumato.

242
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:07,433
The technique of blending.

243
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:10,043
The background you see in this painting

244
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,214
is a landscape.

245
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:12,867
It is the Arno Valley in Italy.

246
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:17,701
There are no clear boundaries or outlines 
between the background and Mona Lisa.

247
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,734
In some places, Mona Lisa's hair is blended with the landscape.

248
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:23,328
Blurring the outlines and blending the colours

249
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:25,267
is the technique of Sfumato.

250
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:29,165
This is the secret behind Mona Lisa's mysterious smile.

251
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:31,329
Look at Mona Lisa's smile carefully.

252
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,888
The more you look at this smile,

253
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:37,033
the more serious this face will look.

254
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:39,601
But now look into Mona Lisa's eyes.

255
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:42,643
Suddenly, you will see Lisa smiling more.

256
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,112
If you look at any part of the painting,

257
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:49,117
be it the background, Mona Lisa's forehead or her eyes,

258
00:10:49,117 --> 00:10:50,696
you will see the effect.

259
00:10:50,696 --> 00:10:52,965
Lisa's face starts smiling more

260
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:55,283
when you don't focus on the smile.

261
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:56,893
To perfect this smile,

262
00:10:56,893 --> 00:10:59,049
da Vinci spent the most time.

263
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,889
He spent many nights in a hospital in Florence,

264
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:05,297
where he used to go and remove the skin of d3ad bodies.

265
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,964
He wanted to study the facial muscles and nerves

266
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:11,559
and how they work together to create a smile.

267
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,288
He wrote in his book that

268
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:14,831
"the muscles which move the lips

269
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:16,472
are more numerous in man

270
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:17,944
than in any other animal."

271
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:21,272
It was very difficult for him to dissect the muscles of the lips

272
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:25,570
because the muscles here are tiny and numerous.

273
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,251
During this experiment,

274
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:29,352
da Vinci studied horses as well.

275
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:32,762
He compared human expressions to that of horses.

276
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:34,190
In the notes, he wrote,

277
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,505
"Notice whether the muscle that

278
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:37,078
raises the nostrils of the horse

279
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:38,235
is the same as that which

280
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:39,306
lies here in man."

281
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:41,755
Hardly, throughout history, any other artist

282
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:44,657
has dissected the faces of a horse and a human

283
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:46,357
and done these experiments.

284
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:49,058
His obsession with Mona Lisa's smile

285
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,079
didn't end here.

286
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,557
After this, he did research on optics as well.

287
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:54,577
He found that the light rays

288
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:57,110
don't merge together into a single point on our eyes,

289
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,220
rather they spread out over the entire retina.

290
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,033
The centre of the retina,

291
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:02,461
known as the Fovea,

292
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:05,292
helps us see the finest details.

293
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,605
On the other hand, the rest of the retina

294
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:10,550
picks up shadows and black-and-white imagery more.

295
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,165
Using this knowledge,

296
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,320
he focused on the shadows in such a way that

297
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,583
even when you see the Mona Lisa in your peripheral vision,

298
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,285
as in, if you are looking this way 
and Mona Lisa is on the other side,

299
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:22,216
even if you are not paying attention to Mona Lisa,

300
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:25,409
the effect of her smile is still there.

301
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:27,253
When you look at her smile closely,

302
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:29,858
you will see that its central line is a flat line,

303
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:32,011
is why when you look at her smile,

304
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:34,274
it looks like she is not smiling at all.

305
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:37,731
But on the other hand, 
the shadows created using the Sfumato technique,

306
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:40,114
have such an effect that

307
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:41,993
when you look elsewhere,

308
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:44,381
your peripheral vision sees that smile

309
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,034
and its shadows are reflected.

310
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:48,385
And then you feel that Lisa is smiling.

311
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:50,698
How would it feel if I told you that

312
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:52,841
the Mona Lisa is not one painting,

313
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:54,310
rather two paintings.

314
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,679
This is not a conspiracy theory,

315
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,192
it's the truth.

316
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:59,380
Mona Lisa's painting, as we know,

317
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,328
a similar painting was created

318
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:03,512
at the same time.

319
00:13:03,512 --> 00:13:05,617
The story of this second Mona Lisa began

320
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:07,203
in the year 1504

321
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,791
when another legendary artist named Raphael

322
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,601
made a rough sketch using pen and ink.

323
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:14,872
This sketch looked something like this

324
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:16,896
and if you compare it with the Mona Lisa in Louvre,

325
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,605
you can see a huge difference.

326
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:20,169
In this sketch by Raphael,

327
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:23,289
you can see two columns behind Mona Lisa.

328
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:24,864
Here, the researchers believed that

329
00:13:24,864 --> 00:13:28,027
Raphael must have made his drawing based on the Mona Lisa painting.

330
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:29,243
So, it was initially brushed off.

331
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:33,605
But this theory was disproved by 
a German art historian in 1993.

332
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,086
And Professor Pallanti, whom I had mentioned earlier,

333
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:39,668
who had been researching the identity of the Mona Lisa for 25 years,

334
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:42,676
confirmed that Raphael actually

335
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:47,567
lived right in front of the Giocondo family in Florence.

336
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,811
So, does this mean that Raphael

337
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:51,075
made an original painting 

338
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:52,334
on the same subject,

339
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,603
with the same woman in the same pose?

340
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:56,203
This seems quite unbelievable.

341
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,264
Another answer to this question could be that

342
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:00,894
another Mona Lisa painting exists

343
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:03,951
which inspired Raphael to make this drawing.

344
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:07,241
And this second Mona Lisa painting was revealed to the world

345
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:08,867
in 1914.

346
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:10,910
A novelist living near London,

347
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,778
John R. Eyer,

348
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:15,694
had a new version of the Mona Lisa.

349
00:14:15,694 --> 00:14:17,959
This is the new Mona Lisa painting.

350
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,127
The same painting based on which

351
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:21,307
Raphael made his drawing.

352
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:22,801
This second Mona Lisa

353
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:24,938
is 3.5 inches longer

354
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:26,864
and 5 inches wider than the one in the Louvre.

355
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:29,043
If you compare these two paintings,

356
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:30,663
you will notice three things.

357
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:33,549
First, the woman in this new Mona Lisa

358
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:35,191
looks much younger.

359
00:14:35,191 --> 00:14:37,266
Second, the head in this new painting

360
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:39,154
is tilted a little forward.

361
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:41,623
And third, the expressions of this new Mona Lisa

362
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:44,211
are very straightforward and clear.

363
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:46,352
There is nothing mysterious about her smile

364
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,053
that is in the Mona Lisa in Louvre.

365
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,044
The two columns in the background

366
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:52,607
are the ones seen in Raphael's drawing.

367
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:54,175
Due to these reasons,

368
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:56,468
a new theory is coined by the experts.

369
00:14:56,468 --> 00:15:01,009
That Leonardo da Vinci was actually working on two Mona Lisas.

370
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:05,091
Leonardo da Vinci painted both these Mona Lisa.

371
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:08,001
But the Isleworth Mona Lisa that was later discovered

372
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:10,680
was the first version of da Vinci's painting.

373
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,049
He was experimenting with his style then.

374
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:16,439
And this is why the Mona Lisa in that painting

375
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:20,587
looks younger than the other Mona Lisa.

376
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,702
This theory remains a topic of debate to date.

377
00:15:23,702 --> 00:15:25,989
In 2010, the Mona Lisa Foundation

378
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:29,024
started an investigation on the Isleworth Mona Lisa

379
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:31,031
to find out the secret behind it.

380
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,184
And they came up with another theory.

381
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:36,767
They said that the face and hands of this new Mona Lisa

382
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:38,056
were indeed painted by da Vinci.

383
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:41,225
But the background was painted by an inferior artist.

384
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:44,837
Perhaps, a person working in Leonardo's workshop

385
00:15:44,837 --> 00:15:47,630
had finished this painting.

386
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,698
Both these theories remain mere theories

387
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:54,036
because no solid evidence has been found on either side.

388
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,025
Coming back to the theft of the Mona Lisa,

389
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:59,214
it was found that the mastermind of this theft, Vincenzo Peruggia,

390
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:01,531
was an employee in the Louvre Museum.

391
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:03,650
One day, he hid in some corner in the museum

392
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,592
and spent the night there

393
00:16:05,592 --> 00:16:09,207
after which, the next morning, he walked out with the painting.

394
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:12,149
He believed that since Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian,

395
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:15,026
this painting should be in an Italian museum.

396
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:16,547
When the news of the theft spread,

397
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:18,622
it made headlines all over the world.

398
00:16:18,622 --> 00:16:21,253
Scores of detectives were put to work

399
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:23,848
to look for the thief.

400
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:25,743
But no one could find him.

401
00:16:25,743 --> 00:16:30,269
For two years, Peruggia hid this painting at his home.

402
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:32,646
He wondered what he could do with it.

403
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:34,457
The whole world was looking for it.

404
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:36,401
Finally, he became impatient

405
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:38,084
and tried to sell the painting.

406
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:43,068
He tried to sell this painting to an art dealer in Florence

407
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,592
To Giovanni Poggi.

408
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:46,158
Giovanni became suspicious

409
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:49,506
and saw the stamp on the painting to confirm that

410
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:51,794
it was the stolen painting.

411
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:54,571
He was being sold the most wanted item in the world.

412
00:16:54,571 --> 00:16:56,760
Because of this, Vincenzo was caught

413
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,759
and was sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment.

414
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:02,729
The painting was sent back to the Louvre Museum

415
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:05,690
and was hung up on 4th January, 1914.

416
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,036
Today, this painting is displayed there,

417
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:09,623
behind bulletproof glass,

418
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:11,978
in strict climate-controlled conditions

419
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:16,420
where humidity is maintained at 50% +/- 10%,

420
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,593
temperature is strictly maintained at 18°C to 21°C.

421
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:23,944
Perhaps the most interesting part in this story is that

422
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:25,690
only after this theft

423
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,086
did Mona Lisa's popularity start increasing.

424
00:17:28,086 --> 00:17:31,695
And it became the world's #1 famous painting.

425
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:32,619
That's right.

426
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:35,723
Before the theft, the Mona Lisa was not very famous.

427
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:37,396
People who were interested in art,

428
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:39,534
knew about the Mona Lisa but

429
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:42,425
the common folks did not know about the Mona Lisa.

430
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:45,132
So, if you go to the Louvre Museum

431
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,089
and see the painting of the Mona Lisa

432
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:49,604
and you see a crowd of people around it,

433
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:54,317
then you can blame Vincenzo for this popularity.

434
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:57,888
