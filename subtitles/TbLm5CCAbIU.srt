1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,490
- This is a video of the
best workers on the planet.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,323
- The best.

3
00:00:03,323 --> 00:00:05,970
- Like this guy who can make
a whopper in under one second

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,000
or this person who can do
the job of a hundred people.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,440
- That's crazy, we should hire him.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,230
- All right, so we have a bus
boy cleaning a table, bro.

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,900
This dude's cleaning at
like his life's on the line.

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,580
- He's sonic and he is speed

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,380
- For some reason this reminds me of like

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,400
a battle in Naruto.

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,620
I wanna go there and
order a hundred pancakes

12
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,880
but each on a different plate.

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,500
So then he has to pick up all of them.

14
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,820
I wanna see a God in action.

15
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,770
- Oh, this is the type of stuff I like.

16
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,720
This is working smarter, not harder.

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,610
- No way, is this how you actually do it?

18
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,650
- This is how you break
things if you want to.

19
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,700
But this guy got lucky.

20
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,800
- That is probably the
coolest thing I've ever seen.

21
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,720
I wonder if it costs less to hire him

22
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,340
because he doesn't need a real truck.

23
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,080
- It probably calls more to insure him

24
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,600
because there's a good chance
he's gonna break something.

25
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,370
- Bro is moving.

26
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,203
- Oh my goodness.

27
00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:49,320
Oh, it's firefighter truck.

28
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,153
- Oh, snap.

29
00:00:50,153 --> 00:00:51,330
- We assume he's a firefighter.

30
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,414
He could just be a guy who
really likes climbing ladders.

31
00:00:53,414 --> 00:00:54,390
- We?

32
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,223
You!

33
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:56,056
- Sorry.

34
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:56,889
- All right.

35
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:57,722
This is the fastest Whopper ever made.

36
00:00:57,722 --> 00:00:58,590
- I'll be the judge of that.

37
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,060
Actually, that person with the clock

38
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,960
will be the judge of that.

39
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,030
- Look at him, his positioning, his face.

40
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,770
That is intense focus.

41
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,453
We're about to witness history.

42
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,380
- Oh, ketchup fell over part of his plan.

43
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,250
See, now it's ready.

44
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,200
Oh my God, it was ready for the squirt.

45
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,563
- Yes.

46
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:17,400
- I would say I'm impressed,
but Burger King sucks.

47
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,140
Go order Beast Burger
it's 30 times better.

48
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,900
- Burger Kings do Beast Burger better.

49
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,787
- Oh my God.

50
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:25,410
- Oh, that's sick.

51
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,243
- Oh

52
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:27,076
- He's just popping off.

53
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:28,410
- If I saw that, I would
just walk up to him

54
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,610
and give him a $50 bill.

55
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,530
- Yeah, I have a strong urge
to give him tons of money.

56
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,000
I wonder what's gonna happen.

57
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,950
Oh wait, that's not what
I thought would happen.

58
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,180
I thought they were about to pop off.

59
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,540
- This man knows physics,
geometry, and math.

60
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,560
He's unstoppable.

61
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,610
You know what's more impressive

62
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,526
than that guy who's
clearly forklift certified?

63
00:01:43,526 --> 00:01:44,359
- Who?

64
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,790
- This rectangular ice cream cone.

65
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,105
What is this?

66
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:48,030
- I got it.

67
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,200
Circular ice cream cone.

68
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,510
This ice cream goes up to
the edges when it melts,

69
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,380
it drips down the side.

70
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,550
It's sticky and it sucks.

71
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,050
This one, it drips into the box.

72
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,669
- Yeah, it's like a bathtub.
- It is.

73
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:57,540
It's like an ice cream cone bathtub.

74
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,130
- Oh my God, this is genius.

75
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,090
- Whoa, it's still going.

76
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,923
- Look at that.

77
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:02,250
And he made a sword with it.

78
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,083
This guy's smart.

79
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,440
I've always thought about doing this,

80
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,273
but I've never done it

81
00:02:05,273 --> 00:02:06,106
- Until he falls.

82
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:06,939
- I like the music.

83
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:09,060
It makes it feel like I'm
watching a Disney princess

84
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,110
- Making a fence.

85
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,280
- They make it with sand.

86
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,113
Oh my God.

87
00:02:12,113 --> 00:02:13,230
That's so genius.

88
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,190
Cause then they can just pour.

89
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,023
Oh my God.

90
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:16,260
That's Minecraft.

91
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,670
But real life.
- That's cool.

92
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,860
This is the world's best cucumber chopper.

93
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,870
- I've already sliced my
hands a thousand times

94
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,703
if this was me.

95
00:02:22,703 --> 00:02:23,760
- Wow.
- That's paper thin.

96
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,593
- Here's the problem.

97
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:25,440
Cucumbers tastes horrible.

98
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,273
- Whoa.

99
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:27,660
Oh, when the clip said a bunch of men

100
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,210
pounding on the title card,
I thought something else.

101
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,050
This is cool.

102
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,940
- More importantly,
where's that spike going?

103
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,950
Are they like literally
nailing the parking lot

104
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,783
to the earth?

105
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:36,616
- I know what they're doing.

106
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,340
They're building experiences together.

107
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,390
- Losers.

108
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,770
Window cleaning contests.

109
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,270
I wouldn't believe if it's real

110
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,220
if there wasn't a giant
banner in the background.

111
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,810
- You're not telling
me you're not a big fan

112
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,870
of the International Window
Cleaning Association.

113
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,950
- IWCA?

114
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,170
- It's just a bunch of old dads.

115
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,040
This guy's good though.

116
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,910
Marty's killing it.

117
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,750
Yeah!

118
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,703
- Cleaning up dishes.

119
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:57,439
- He's making a flower.

120
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,801
- Somebody's dad.

121
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,630
He's making a flower.

122
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,730
I strive to be that annoying of a dad.

123
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,580
- Wow

124
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,513
That's impressive.

125
00:03:05,513 --> 00:03:06,397
That's someone who loves their job.

126
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:07,710
- [TikTok ker} Got
something new for y'all.

127
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,270
I am super proud of this one.

128
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,103
- Is that toilet paper?

129
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:12,570
- I'm going to call the
mega multiverse combo.

130
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,090
- Oh, I did not know where that was.

131
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,650
Oh my God, that is insane.

132
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,880
- Wait so he tie dyed that?

133
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,310
- He tie dyed that with rubber bands

134
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,830
in certain ways that those
patterns would get on the shirt.

135
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,360
- Some would say, Epic.

136
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,460
Oh, it's the attractive
guy that hits wood.

137
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,953
- I see the comments all the time.

138
00:03:27,953 --> 00:03:30,930
Everybody's mom is on
this guy's TikTok page.

139
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,430
Oh, he's ripping it this time.

140
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,313
Nice.

141
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:35,430
- Moms, leave a comment on the video.

142
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,590
I really want to get our mom
demographic up a little bit.

143
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,640
Bobcat Pro driver.

144
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,810
- Whoa, he nice with it?

145
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,880
- Oh, oh.

146
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,200
- Bro, why is this guy so good?

147
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,480
I would love to see what
jobs he gets hired for.

148
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,620
- I'd hire him for a circus.

149
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,240
Hey, let's watch this
guy work with his wood.

150
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,740
- Wait, no, that's not his wood.

151
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,679
That's a piece of wood.

152
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:52,110
- Oh, is this a bed post?

153
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,010
- That or a lampshade.

154
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,843
- We'll never know.

155
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:56,760
- You will forever wonder
and never get the answer.

156
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,593
Ever.

157
00:03:57,593 --> 00:03:58,830
Good luck sleeping tonight.

158
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,663
- Oh yeah.

159
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:01,020
I did this as a kid with my four wheeler.

160
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,890
I lived in the country.

161
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,723
I had a four wheeler.

162
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:04,410
We didn't have these fancy go-karts.

163
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,243
- Oh my God.

164
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:06,210
That's pretty innovative.

165
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,800
- Fun fact, I heard that go-kart.

166
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,960
Speeding past my house
at 3:00 AM last night

167
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,930
and I looked out and Carl was
doing donuts in my front yard.

168
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,790
- Bro, why don't I get
invited to the adventures?

169
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,650
- I guess you just gotta
be there when Carl has his

170
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,760
3:00 AM adventures.

171
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,170
Whoa.

172
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,540
He said physics pause for one second.

173
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,590
I gotta look cool.

174
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,450
Okay, it touched his
finger on the last one.

175
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,040
Did anybody see it pour down his finger

176
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,940
and go into the drink.

177
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,257
- Oh wow, I'm still taking the shot.

178
00:04:28,257 --> 00:04:30,810
Of great juice, shot of great juice.

179
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,820
- I mean, I could trim a
bush like this, I feel like

180
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,290
I don't feel like this one's any special.

181
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,060
Show me a penguin or a giraffe.

182
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,272
- Oh, he missed a spot.
- He missed a spot.

183
00:04:37,272 --> 00:04:38,167
- He missed his spot.
- He's about to hit that spot.

184
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:41,099
- Hit the spot.
- Hit that spot right there.

185
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:42,840
Yeah, there we go.

186
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,830
- I almost ended the video.

187
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,450
This person's cutting up some food.

188
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,500
- They have pretty hands.

189
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,370
Is that Chandler?

190
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,598
- Today we are making
HelloFresh stir-fried tacos.

191
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:51,540
- Wait, since when can Chandler cook?

192
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,084
- With the sponsors video, HelloFresh.

193
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,690
Anyone in the world can cook.

194
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,700
They have 30 different weekly recipes

195
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,160
that you can choose from to
have delivered to your doorstep.

196
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,200
HelloFresh even cuts down on food waste

197
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,490
over using grocery store.

198
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,500
And most importantly,
you save time and money.

199
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,338
Instead of ordering delivery,
going to a restaurant

200
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:09,270
or a grocery store, just
use HelloFresh, instead.

201
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,350
If you don't know what to cook

202
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,090

Look how good that food turned out.

208
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,955
If Chandler can make food like that,

209
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,610

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,870

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,050
Let's go eat at Chandler's house.

213
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,698
- As long as he's making HelloFresh.

214
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,220
Building a cell tower.

215
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,680
Oh my God, that is insane.

216
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,580
- How'd they get up there?

217
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,080
Oh my goodness.

218
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,880
- Old man with ten lawnmowers.

219
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,050
- This is probably the coolest thing

220
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,920
I've ever seen in my life.

221
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,920
- This is the smartest old
man in the entire world.

222
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,234
- This guy pulls up to your front door,

223
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:49,392
demands your girlfriend.

224
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:50,340
What's you doing?

225
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,173
- It's hers.

226
00:05:51,173 --> 00:05:52,320
I mean, it's his, I don't know.

227
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,390
I'm so confused by these lawnmowers.

228
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,470
He can have whatever he wants.

229
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,303
He can have the house.

230
00:05:56,303 --> 00:05:57,136
My dog.

231
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:57,969
The yard.

232
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:59,012
- Wait, what's going on here?

233
00:05:59,012 --> 00:05:59,845
- Oh

234
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:00,690
- Drift.

235
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,560
- Drift acholic.

236
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,910
Yeah, this guy's good at parking.

237
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,430
This is the most British
thing I've ever seen

238
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,340
a man getting excited
about parallel parking.

239
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,173
Oh my God.

240
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:10,470
They're playing Minecraft IRL,

241
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,060
put the Minecraft music over it

242
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,380
and then when he puts
it in the wheelbarrow,

243
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,090
make the chest sound.

244
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,923
That's funny now.

245
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:17,670
Lighting a lighter with an excavator.

246
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,503
- No way.

247
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,830
- What?
- How did he do that?

248
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,880
That is so cool.

249
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,790
- Why did he have to use
seven phones as a table?

250
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,380
Couldn't he use like a rock or something?

251
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,300
- He just borrowed everyone's
like, Hey everyone,

252
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,133
gimme your phones.

253
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:28,966
- Give me your phones.

254
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:30,000
I need them, they might break.

255
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,620
This guy needed a trim bad

256
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,084
giving a good shear call him Ed Shearing.

257
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:34,950
No

258
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,180
- That's not the same person.

259
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,710
There's no way that's the same person.

260
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,700
Hold on. It is!

261
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,340
He made that guy look like a
completely different person

262
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,173
with that haircut.

263
00:06:42,173 --> 00:06:43,020
Wow, that's wild.

264
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,250
They say the hair makes the man.

265
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,210
- Wait what happens here?

266
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,790
- He's destroying the,-
- The ceiling he's on.

267
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,050
- But he's on a crane.

268
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,163
He's like, I'm free.

269
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,830
Oh my God.

270
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,150
It's Jason Bourne.

271
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,110
I feel like I can do that.

272
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,730
Oh my God.

273
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,008
- Delivering your food on time.

274
00:06:58,008 --> 00:06:59,689
- I want to go here right now.

275
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:00,600
- Hey bro.

276
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,169
It's the hundred pancakes
I ordered earlier.

277
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:04,080
- They're finally here.

278
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,130
- One for a bowl.

279
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:05,963
Oh my gosh.

280
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:06,796
I didn't even know this was here.

281
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:08,730
- Let's go, with the
call back of a century.

282
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,610
- Whatever this restaurant
is, bring that guy in.

283
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,760
He can clean it up quick.

284
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,160
- I'm leaving whatever
this job can be considered

285
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,930
to go be a rollerskate-
- You don't work here.

286
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:16,830
- Yeah, you're right.

287
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,810
They just keep unlocking
the door and let me back in.

288
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,742
- I give him free food.

289
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,040
- That's gotta be in Japan.

290
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,870
And why do we live in America, man?

291
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,980
Look, they got it figured out.

292
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,000
- But is she drawing?

293
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,833
Oh my gosh.

294
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,640
- Is she better with her
feet or with her hand?

295
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,170
- She's doing them all at the same time.

296
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,260
- The ones with her hand
are so photorealistic.

297
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,780
- There's no way this is real.

298
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,920
I, I refuse to believe it.

299
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,460
If this is real, it is factually

300
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,420
the coolest thing I've ever seen

301
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,950
and I've said that many
times in this video.

302
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,970
Zoom in on the bottom right one.

303
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,230
She drew that with her foot

304
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,700
while drawing with her other foot.

305
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,500
You have no talent compared to her

306
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,333
- I, you're right.

307
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,166
- Neither do I.

308
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:48,999
- This looks like a really good way

309
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,040
for a customer to be like

310
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,230
all right I'm walking out
and then just bang, tire.

311
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,100
- Using a water shield.

312
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,540
- Oh, that's cool.

313
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,970
Oh, it was like a propane
tank that was on fire.

314
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,130
So he is using the
water to shield the fire

315
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,120
so he can turn it off.

316
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,963
Genius.

317
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,670
Where do you, where did
he get that fire from?

318
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,440
- I don't know where the fire came from.

319
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,370
- He is Prince Zuko.

320
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,023
Refueling an RC car.

321
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,740
Oh, this is one of those cars that runs

322
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,150
off of like pure alcohol.

323
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,290
That's why they're so fast.

324
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,123
Look at that thing.

325
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:22,136
- Remind you, when we tried
to push a car with RC cars.

326
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,273
Oh my god.
- Oh my God.

327
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:28,200
- Wait, is that really how they film?

328
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,520
- Wow, he is really good at that.

329
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,490
- He might just put Tariq out of a job.

330
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,323
Oh my God.

331
00:08:33,323 --> 00:08:34,770
So the wasps were just
like standing there.

332
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,600
It's like the wasps are paid actors.

333
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,420
- Well, I think the wasp for
like God wouldn't intervene

334
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,810
between the fights of wasp
and bees and then God's like.

335
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,453
Makes sense.

336
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,370
- Funny pan sound.

337
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,200
Is it the spin and drummer guy?

338
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,033
Yeah.

339
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:50,866
Go drum guy.

340
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:51,699
Go drum guy.

341
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:53,400
- Would you say he's the
best drummer in the world?

342
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,410
- I would say he's probably
the dizziest drummer

343
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,243
in the world.

344
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:57,076
- Thank you so much for watching.

345
00:08:57,076 --> 00:08:57,909
I hope you enjoyed it.

346
00:08:57,909 --> 00:08:58,742

347
00:08:58,742 --> 00:09:00,033
