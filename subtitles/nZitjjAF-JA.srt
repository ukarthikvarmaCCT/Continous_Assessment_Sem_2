'I feel like giving you
a tight hug right now.'

8
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:38,046
Only Siddhi would arrange
things properly for me like that.

9
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,721
No. No. How is this possible?

10
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:05,878
Dadiya.

11
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:14,734
Dadiya, Maya, was Siddhi here?
Did you see her?

12
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:17,987
What's wrong? Why are you shouting?

13
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:20,641
Dadiya. Maya. Just come with me.

14
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:22,008
Please come.

15
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:23,238
Come.

16
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,335
See. Siddhi would do this.

17
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:31,269
Good Lord.
How can Siddhi come here?

18
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:32,767
What are you saying?

19
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:34,011
Listen to me.

20
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:37,429
Vinayak, Siddhi is no more.

21
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:40,833
She left us two months ago.

22
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:44,809
I wish what you said comes true.

23
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:47,266
That she comes back here to us.

24
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,091
But this is not possible.

25
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:51,078
If that's not possible
then who did this?

26
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,042
Only Siddhi would arrange
my things alphabetically like that.

27
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:56,513
No one else can do it.

28
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,942
Hey...

29
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:02,622
Why the heck are you shouting, mister?

30
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,440
What happened? Huh?

31
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:12,987
Okay. Tell me honestly.

32
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:17,002
What kind of a relationship
did you share with your wife?

33
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:20,304
Did you harass her?

34
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:21,652
Shut up.

35
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:30,336
Look, I will not beat around the bush.

36
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,915
I'll explain to you in short.

37
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:38,709
Look, when we torture
or harass someone when he is alive

38
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:42,983
his soul isn't at rest after death.

39
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:46,781
It comes back to seek revenge.

40
00:03:46,861 --> 00:03:50,320
And tortures us the way we tortured it.

41
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:57,216
I mean, was it your wife's spirit?

42
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:04,201
Look, if you have wronged your wife

43
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,583
then atone for your sins
and apologise to her.

44
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:11,748
Or glory be to the Lord.

45
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:15,078
Shut your mouth.

Vinayak...

48
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,153
How can you talk rubbish about
my sister without knowing her?

49
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,926
She never believed in revenge.

50

I was sure

54
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:18,730
you'd come back to me one day.

55
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:20,759
Do you remember our last night together?

56
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:23,712
We had such a hearty chat.

57

Every moment was full of love.

But despite it, you...

I know, Siddhi.

60
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:34,824
I scolded you a little too harshly.

61
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:38,222
I shouldn't have done that.

62
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:40,228
I am sorry.

63

Vinayak, what happened?
Who were you talking to?

70

Maya, I was talking to Siddhi.

I wonder where she went.

She is dead.

Wait a second.

In the past, it gave you the chance

he is also responsible for the death

00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,816
Speak up. Who are you?

185
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:34,176
Speak up.

186
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,528
Siddhi!

187
00:14:59,395 --> 00:15:00,291
'I wonder what's going to happen.'

188
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:03,179
'Aunt has seen me
and she thinks I am a ghost.'

189
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:05,086
'I must do something in the morning.'

190
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:11,968
Siddhi darling.

191
00:15:15,826 --> 00:15:18,979
O' spirit of Siddhi, I am sorry...

192
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:26,557
I mean I beg your pardon.

193
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:28,281
Forgive me.

194
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:30,640
I am stupid and ignorant.

195
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,616
And you are great.

196
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:40,308
And I promise to venerate
you every day, Siddhi darling.

197
00:15:40,795 --> 00:15:43,219
Glory to Siddhi.

198
00:15:44,328 --> 00:15:45,411
Aunt,

199
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:47,721
what are you doing?

200
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:49,473
And what's all this?

201
00:15:49,553 --> 00:15:55,049
Siddhi's ghost is back
to seek revenge from me.

202
00:15:57,108 --> 00:15:58,966
I harassed her so much.

203
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:01,289
So she is not going to spare me.

204
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,799
Aunt, what rubbish!

205
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:04,704
Stop it.

206
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:07,786
Like I said. Siddhi is alive. She is fine.

207
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,037
She will come back to me one day.

208
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:11,700
Say what you want.

209
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,499
But the fact is that

210
00:16:14,158 --> 00:16:17,724
Siddhi's spirit is here in this house.

211
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:22,300
I am sure she has come to fulfil

212
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:23,943
her unfulfilled desire.

213
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:28,657
Glory to Siddhi.

214
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,685
No. Siddhi cannot die.

215
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,042
She is alive.
Let them say what they want.

216
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:40,381
I refuse to believe them.

217
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:42,891
Siddhi is alive.

218
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:44,945
She will come back to me one day.

219
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:54,692
Ma'am, does he believe it?

220
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:57,220
Now what do I say?

221
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,949
He is not ready to believe it.

222
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:00,633
I tried all I could

223
00:17:01,004 --> 00:17:02,520
to make him believe that Siddhi
is no more.

224
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,342
Whatever it is

225
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:07,448
but I am so scared.

226
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:11,118
She is stubborn as hell. I mean by Siddhi.

227
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:13,128
She will not spare me.

228
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,705
She will take her revenge.

229
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:17,968
I don't know.

230
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:19,340
How do I save myself?

231
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:24,528
Something similar happened
at my village too.

232
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:30,314
A woman died with an unfulfilled desire.

233
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,861
And then the entire family would see her.

234
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:36,317
And then...

235
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:42,412
Ma'am, she would try to seek revenge

236
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:44,638
by attacking the entire family.

237
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,032
The spirit was really dangerous.

238
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:52,230
Is it that the girl...

239
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:55,523
- What's her name?
- Siddhi.

240
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:58,912
Is Siddhi's spirit also...

241
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:02,529
No. Siddhi was not like that.

242
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:05,018
She was very noble and nice.

243
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:07,116
She can never do that to me.

244
00:18:07,642 --> 00:18:09,309
I agree

245
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:11,306
I have made some mistakes.

246
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:12,944
A few mistakes.

247
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:15,930
- Right.
- And that's why she is haunting me.

248
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:19,735
I am so scared.

249
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:21,576
How do I save myself?

250
00:18:21,656 --> 00:18:23,073
There is a way.

251
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:28,225
The person who loves Siddhi the most
in this house

252
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:31,963
can tell you what her last wish was.

253
00:18:32,043 --> 00:18:34,822
Yes. There is. Vinayak.

254
00:18:34,902 --> 00:18:37,518
He loves her the most.

255
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:41,181
He must be knowing
what Siddhi's last wish was.

256
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:43,522
I will try to find out.

257
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:44,731
Vinu must be knowing.

258
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:51,230
'Aunt, you are wrong in thinking
that Vinayak loves me the most.'

259
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,519
'The truth is something else.'

260
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:56,506
'A truth that shook me up completely.'

261
00:18:56,724 --> 00:18:58,383
What's going on in this house?

262
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:00,317
Everyone is seeing Siddhi everywhere.

263
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:03,269
Tanmay, are you sure she is dead?

264
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:05,008
No one can survive

265
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:07,723
after falling from such a great height.

266
00:19:13,461 --> 00:19:14,880
'Maya should be in her room.'

267
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,328
'I'll go give her some hot milk.'

268
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,613
The vultures must have
devoured her body by now.

269
00:19:27,818 --> 00:19:29,065
Don't worry.

270
00:19:29,145 --> 00:19:32,110
Your darling sister must be dead by now.

271
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:37,220
Do you remember

272
00:19:37,505 --> 00:19:40,632
how I pushed her off the cliff
so dramatically?

273
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:51,496
I slept soundly that night

274
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,485
after a long time.

275
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,210
Siddhi is dead.

276
00:19:59,672 --> 00:20:01,885
And Vinayak is listless.

277
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:04,761
And you are the mastermind behind it.

278
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,562
I was just following your orders.

279
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:12,400
You should get the credit
for killing Siddhi.

280
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:27,936
Pretty madam, what happened?

281
00:20:28,618 --> 00:20:30,510
What were you muttering to yourself?

282
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:33,447
I don't see anyone here.

283
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,413
Hmm?

284
00:20:41,494 --> 00:20:45,600
Actually, I am missing my sister terribly.

285
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,829
She was my protector.

286
00:20:48,536 --> 00:20:50,145
She was my world.

287
00:20:52,612 --> 00:20:53,629
Never mind.

288
00:20:57,571 --> 00:21:01,035
'I feel like embracing you
and telling you the truth'

289
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:03,135
'that your Siddhi is back.'

290
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,613
'But I cannot tell you or anyone'

291
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:11,020
'about myself until I expose Vinayak.'

292
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:14,824
'I am going to expose
Vinayak very soon.'

293
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:17,126
'I promise you.'

294
00:21:28,341 --> 00:21:29,502
He is here.

295
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:31,137
'Maya is so treacherous.'

296
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:32,521
'First, she kills her sister.'

297
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:35,048
'And now she is shedding
crocodile tears before this maid.'

298
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,783
'One should learn from her
how to deceive your own.'

299
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:41,078
Grab him. Hold his hand.

300
00:21:41,158 --> 00:21:42,218
Who is this?

301
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:43,327
Leave me.

302
00:21:43,861 --> 00:21:45,236
Why have you caught me?

303
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:46,328
Let me go.

304
00:22:07,932 --> 00:22:10,044
You will have to tell the truth, Vinayak.

305
00:22:11,457 --> 00:22:12,909
You will have to tell everyone

306
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,143
why you did that to me.

307
00:22:16,994 --> 00:22:18,403
And on whose orders.

308
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:27,125
What are you doing?

309
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,972
And why have you got me here?

310
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:32,104
If we let you go, how will we find out

311
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:33,509
what we want to know.

312
00:22:33,627 --> 00:22:35,600
The truth.

313
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,851
What do you want to know?

314
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:40,490
Siddhi's last wish.

315
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,596
- Tell me quickly.
- How would I know?

316
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:43,961
Please let me go.

317
00:22:48,383 --> 00:22:52,699
To lie is a sin. Beware of your sins.

318
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:54,238
My efforts are on.

319
00:22:54,318 --> 00:22:55,947
It's time for the doctor now.

320
00:22:56,027 --> 00:22:58,927
Glory to the Lord.

321
00:23:01,408 --> 00:23:04,168
Come. Show some magic.

322
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:06,515
Hope you remember
the chat we had on the phone.

323
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:10,141
Open your pandora's box
and get cracking.

324
00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:13,496
Doctor, you have to help me.

325
00:23:13,735 --> 00:23:16,846
Otherwise, I will never be able
to expose him.

326
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:18,910
He took away my family

327
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:22,823
my right of being a wife

328
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:24,840
my child,

329
00:23:25,923 --> 00:23:28,031
my joy, my hope,

330
00:23:28,396 --> 00:23:29,824
he took everything from me.

331
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:33,617
I want to expose my husband at any cost.

332
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:35,831
Tell me.

333
00:23:37,036 --> 00:23:38,476
Will you help me?

334
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,625
- Will you come with me?
- Yes.

335
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:50,073
'Today with this doctor's help,
I'll give you a medicine'

336
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:54,101
'which will make you confess your crime'

337
00:23:54,221 --> 00:23:58,167
'and also confess
on whose orders you did that.'
