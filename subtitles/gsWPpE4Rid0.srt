chandler 100 mile an hour car versus

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,480
wall that's a good one there's no story

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,559
in this at all we just duct taped a

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,640
bowling ball into a car and then just

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,800
slammed into trying

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,079
wait wait chris you want to see your

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,640
strike in slow-mo i do why you're so

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,360
happy

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,960
and in case you're wondering yes this

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,399
was filmed on a closed course with

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,399
professional supervision obviously don't

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,600
try this at home this was fun

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,360
what look how far it goes i don't even

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,960
remember filming them

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,640
oh yeah because we could edit the green

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,000
screen we thought it'd be funny to hit a

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
green screen oh wow we hit a shark oh no

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,799
we're getting eaten by a shark oh no we

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,439
get more who puts that there oh wait i

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,960
already know chris is gonna freak out

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,479
chris loves this one so chris what

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,240
happened here you got a bread on this

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,920
card you got a bread on this car they

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,759
hit boom sandwich

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,560
look at that it actually worked kind of

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,240
that counts sort of worked instead of

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,840
having your parents make you sandwiches

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,920
just grab two cars and ram them together

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,600
and that's how you can make it use your

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,360
parents cars and also take their credit

44
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,759
card now after all that chaos it finally

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,920
came to the time when we rammed this car

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,640
100 miles an hour into a wall you threw

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,799
a brick on the gas pedal and there she

48
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,560
goes no one's in the car

49
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,200
she's going she's climbing

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,439
and there you go the build-up of the

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,280
entire video to a blurry camera shot and

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,880
right when i saw that camera shot that's

53
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,640
when i went we're just gonna delete that

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
and that's 100 mile an hour car versus

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,399
wall but not all videos get scrapped

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,920
because they're story lines some videos

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,759
they just fall apart literally here's

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,600
security camera footage of our warehouse

59
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,520
that right there is a giant pit of glue

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,040
and we were gonna do last leave glue

61
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,880
wins a bunch of money but the glue pick

62
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,640
couldn't hold it and it literally just

63
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,720
bust open which is kind of ironic

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,080
because you would think thousands of

65
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,400
pounds of glue would stick together that

66
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
literally took weeks to clean up it

67
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
wasn't fun the next video that didn't

68
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,560
get uploaded is visiting the seven

69
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,560

73
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,520

all right where's chris if you're

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,760
wondering where chris is it's because he

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,319
went to stonehenge and there's nothing

97
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,800
to do there look there's rocks behind us

98
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,720
literally just rocks and it's a wonder

99
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,640

101
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,159

didn't have my footage and we couldn't

113
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,120
upload it and the next video we scrapped

114
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,360
is dominoes we tried to film this domino

115
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,680
video four times and all four times it

116
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,120
didn't work let me run you through it

117
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,799
the first time we filmed this video i

118
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,159
got all the boys in a room and i told

119
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,840
them whoever made the coolest domino

120
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,920
contraption won money but the problem is

121
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,599
they all suck at laying dominoes and it

122
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,439
wasn't that cool so i gave them three

123
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,439
days to build stuff and all they could

124
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,920
build was the eyes of a creeper whatever

125
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
that was seven thousand dominoes that

126
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,920
took a long time yeah you guys had three

127
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,000
days what is this so then the next week

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,519
we tried to lay the world's longest

129
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,759
domino chain this is us laying dominoes

130
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,919
and we were dead set on trying to lay

131
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,000
the longest domino chain ever the wind

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,440
kept knocking it down so we ended up

133
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
laying them on their sides it sounds

134
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
good on paper breaking the world's

135
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,800
longest domino chain but what we quickly

136
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,440
realized is it's boring as crap to watch

137
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
people lay dominoes for 15 minutes all

138
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
these scrap videos are from months ago

139
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,360
obviously none of these are recent what

140
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,440
is this video i don't know here's a shot

141
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,840
of the line after a very long day this

142
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
is all the dominoes look at that that's

143
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,960
a big boy we were dedicated and chandler

144
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,120
did keep knocking it over but you know

145
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
we kept going every time and by chandler

146
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,040
i mean me huh i wonder why this video

147
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,720
didn't get uploaded we're getting bored

148
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
watching it yeah i know for some reason

149
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,800
we thought we'd be able to lay a domino

150
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
chain on the side of a road and break

151
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,720
the world record that way but no once we

152
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,320
realized that we just decided to knock

153
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,639
them all over because why not and uh

154
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,280
yeah this is the the chain that

155
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,400
didn't work

156
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,759
now it doesn't

157
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,759
this is the chain this is not as hype as

158
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,039
i thought it was gonna be this is not a

159
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,039
slope this is so boring i mean you can

160
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,880
clearly see why we scrapped this video

161
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,320
the domino chain might have seemed a

162
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,840
little lame but we had a cool surprise

163
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,440
at the end we literally laid all this

164
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
domino artwork at the end as like a

165
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,360
finale of the video look at that youtube

166
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,280
button that isn't good forever

167
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,039
that's very satisfying that's really

168
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,600
satisfying oh

169
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,199
none of what we laid work we have to

170
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,960
constantly go in and knock more dominoes

171
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,960
over it was a disaster okay we're not

172
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,400
good at laying dominoes you know how

173
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,160
much those dominoes cost how much i

174
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,000
think like 70 grand good thing i didn't

175
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,560
pay for it

176
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,960
social distancing the next video i

177
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,240
scrapped is a video where i wanted to

178
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,080
give a couple dogs the best month of

179
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
their life what i did was i got a barn

180
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
and i renovated it to look like a doggy

181
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,240
wonderland i even built a giant fence

182
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
out back i got the dogs unlimited food

183
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,919
unlimited toys literally anything they

184
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,520
could ever want but the problem is in

185
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,880
america when you're housing a bunch of

186
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,319
dogs there's a ton of laws and

187
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,639
apparently you just can't do it so yeah

188
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,440
i spent like 60 70 000 on this barn and

189
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,759
all this other stuff and then um when it

190
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,520
came to filming i realized oh i'm not

191
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,720
allowed to do this i'm not allowed to

192
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,160
just get a bunch of dogs and treat him

193
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,680
like king apparently you have to have

194
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,360
licenses and stuff to house a bunch of

195
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,919
dogs so we had to get it up next is a

196
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,600
video where we tried to break a bunch of

197
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,440
world records

198
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,960
the gist of it was me and the boys were

199
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,319
gonna try to break like 100 world

200
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,400
records and shocker it's a lot harder

201
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,680
than we thought so these are some of the

202
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,600
ones we did and we even called on cam

203
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,840
newton he's a nfl quarterback to help us

204
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,720
break some football world records

205
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,960

thank you dad

207
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
that was the longest throw through a

208
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,440
tire 31 yards yeah no like road through

209
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,120

chandler broke the world record for the

212
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
longest blindfolded catch believe it or

213
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,639
not this is actually a legit world

214
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,800
record like guinness was there and that

215
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,919
is the longest blindfolded catch ever

216
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,880
another

217
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,960
guinness world record title you all are

218
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,560
still officially amazing thank you hey

219
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,039
you and cam newton broke a world record

220
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,599
yes we did and i want to say thank you

221
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,319
to cam for giving me this record

222
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,759
didn't you break another one with them

223
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,560
oh yes this one right here was held by

224
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,039
a lot of nfl players the most one-handed

225
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,120
catches in a minute was 30. and then you

226
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,720
and cam did 32. 51. wow

227
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,599
oh

228
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,880
with 51 catches

229
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,080
i would not have been able to do it

230
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,160
put my quarterback man

231
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,840
and the final world record we try to

232
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,000
beat is the highest football catch ever

233
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,080
i got in a helicopter 600 feet in the

234
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,919
air and i was dropping footballs as you

235
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,680
see here it was hitting the stadium and

236
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,199
we kept missing and we actually ended up

237
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,639
running out of time so we didn't get

238
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,240
that world record but that one would

239
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
have been sick yeah and the next one we

240
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
scrapped was i built a city out of

241
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
bouncy castles for whatever reason we

242
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,080
thought it'd be a good idea to rent

243
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,319
dozens of bouncy castles and then bring

244
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,240
all these people in and have a city this

245
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,000
drone shot you're looking at right now

246
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,400
we literally built this city out of

247
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
bouncy castles okay so here's how the

248
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,520
video started we pull up to the city

249
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,519
right here out of bounty castle

250
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,279
everything here is bouncing related and

251
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,519
our citizens are very bounce happy

252
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,599
brother bobby boulevard that's a call

253
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,080
back right there look at this tree with

254
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,560
the tags

255
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,640
this is the most embarrassing video

256
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
we've ever filmed in our life but who

257
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
put that there the cringe hasn't even

258
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,399
started yet area each one is complete

259
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,320
with a p.o box and all of our lawnmowers

260
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,360
blow bubbles

261
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,399
all of our lawnmowers blow bubbles this

262
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,560
guy was apparently the town fruit dealer

263
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,080
and he was charging us a hundred dollars

264
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,560
for plastic 100 quality so how much is

265
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,320
that a hundred dollars that's how you

266
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,600
know it's right

267
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,800
how is it

268
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,640
dude the middle of that thing hurt it

269
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,040
was solid i thought that was dude i got

270
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
like five concussions in this video oh

271
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,360
that's where i get great i also told him

272
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
the technique

273
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,040
taylor the entire video is going to

274
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,880
people and saying tackle chris he was

275
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
the good part for some reason we had a

276
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,120
three-way banana duel it was a standoff

277
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,360
yes

278
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,160
we were like what's going on this is

279
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
just a fraction of the city we built

280
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
it's a fraction of the cringe yes better

281
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
way to phrase it all right now bounce

282
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,839
city had a bounce obstacle course

283
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,640
i did great look at this look look at

284
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,080
this

285
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,519
kill look at marcus

286
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,120
and at this part chris had a pair of

287
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
scissors which this is a city made out

288
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
of inflatable bouncy castles right you

289
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
pop it they're done for it so then he

290
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,360
started popping things and then so then

291
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,680
we started running away and everyone

292
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,080
chased us because we had scissors don't

293
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,680
worry i threw the scissors before i

294
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,360
started running

295
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,920
we got chase out of the town because we

296
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,120
had a pair of scissors and that's

297
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
against the rules and that's i built the

298
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,360
city out of bouncy castles that was a an

299
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
emotional roller coaster to say the

300
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,279
least i was hoping that would never see

301
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,200
the light of day but it just did you're

302
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,680
welcome this is my corner of pain and

303
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
the final video i'm going to show you

304
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,360
guys today is this dinosaur video

305
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,120
basically me and the boys rated a mall

306
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,040
with dinosaurs and you guys liked it so

307
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,200
we did it again with even more dinosaurs

308
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,120
and you guys like that so my logic was

309
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,720
let's just do it again with even more

310
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,760
dinosaurs so we bought 1 000 dinosaur

311
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,519
costumes and got hundreds of people to

312
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,200
gather on a day again this was months

313
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,480
ago before all this stuff currently

314
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,480
going on and we gave them all dinosaur

315
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,200
costumes and began to raid places the

316
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,720
reason this didn't work out is i ended

317
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,920
up getting sick and i had to leave

318
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,160
halfway through i hate when i get sick

319
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,399
sick jimmy not good jimmy but regardless

320
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,839
of that the video is still really

321
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,839
freaking funny wow look at all these

322
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,839
dinosaurs i still can't believe we had

323
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,600
all these people come out shout out to

324
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,519
everyone who uh put on the dinosaur

325
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,200
costume i love you guys it was also very

326
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,120
hot that day and of course after playing

327
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,640
around in the field the first place we

328
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,279
had to raid was a gym but not just any

329
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,200
gym a trampoline

330
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,880
all those dinosaurs

331
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,680
oh

332
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,519
wipeouts the idea for this video was if

333
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,800
we just had hundreds of people in

334
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,959
dinosaur costumes we could just go into

335
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,040
stores and it'd be hilarious the gym was

336
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,480
cool but my favorite part is when we

337
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,640
raided the movie theater so here you go

338
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,480
we took hundreds of people in dinosaur

339
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,399
costume to a movie theater we bought

340
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,720
every ticket to every seat in this room

341
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,240
so we could get this shot wasn't that

342
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,279
pretty expensive it was and here it is

343
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,240
that's so funny

344
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,519
wait do we forget to buy two tickets are

345
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,519
they on a date in there then people are

346
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,600
having a date in the middle of our

347
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,880
what

348
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,120
this is a asteroid hitting the earth and

349
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,560
obviously this is going to anger the

350
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,800
dinos that would make me angry it's

351
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,720
giving them flashbacks and they all went

352
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,040
crazy we thought this would be so funny

353
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,200
out of anger we then raided them all

354
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
because

355
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,920
we were forced to watch the earth be

356
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,000
destroyed again everybody was loving it

357
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,600
though at the mall it made everybody's

358
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,360
day at least yeah except for probably

359
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,560
the mall owner was like what in

360
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,480
tarnation that's what he said actually i

361
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,000
heard it when i felt better i wanted to

362
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,440
redo it and i was like so how many

363
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
costumes do we have and when they were

364
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,720
like oh they're all gone everyone just

365
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,240
took them home and i was like

366
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,480

367
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,320
we scrapped tons of videos in the past

368
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
if you add them all up these videos that

369
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,639
i never uploaded probably cost over 400

370
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,120
000 film but i care about you guys and i

371
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,720
don't want to upload garbage and if the

372
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,639
video isn't good i don't upload it and

373
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,399
money aside these videos actually took

374
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,160
forever to make like this bouncy castle

375
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,920

376
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,600
wonders of the world we spent over six

377
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
days flying the domino's video we tried

378
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,079
to film four times the 100 mile an hour

379
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,600
car video we spent almost a week

380
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
prepping for in a few days filming like

381
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
this is like a month's worth of work too

382
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,360
that just never saw the light of day

383
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,120

384
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,959

385
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,160
don't care if we spend a month on a

386
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,360
video if we spent over a hundred

387
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,560
thousand dollars like if it's not

388
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,760
