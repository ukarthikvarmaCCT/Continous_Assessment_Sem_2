00:00:05,753 --> 00:00:06,671
Hello, sir.

2
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:08,384
- Here you are.
- Yes, sir.

3
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:09,782
- How are you?
- Fine.

4
00:00:09,862 --> 00:00:11,181
I was waiting for you.

5
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:14,593
Please, come.

6
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:18,797
Nandini, this is Mr Bakshi,
your teacher.

7
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:21,040
- Sir, please come.
- Yes.

8
00:00:22,318 --> 00:00:23,262
He will be teaching you.

9
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:24,845
Hello.

10
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:29,215
'Wow, she's beautiful!'

11
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:33,187
Nandini is all yours.

12
00:00:35,158 --> 00:00:36,852
Don't trouble him.

13
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,109
Study diligently.

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,359
'I'll handle Aakash later.'

15
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,886
'Let me devour
this pretty lady first.'

16
00:00:57,686 --> 00:01:01,264
I looked for you all over
and here you are taking a stroll.

17
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:04,588
I have great news.

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,488
Aakash aims to educate Nandini.

19
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:15,044
He has asked her to study
and has hired a teacher.

20
00:01:18,354 --> 00:01:21,705
How is that great news, shameless?

21
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:23,204
- But...
- Shut up.

22
00:01:23,718 --> 00:01:30,002
My only solace was that she was
way more uneducated than me.

23
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:36,389
But Aakash wants to
rob me of that joy.

24
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:39,946
You...

25
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:46,936
Let me finish.

26
00:01:47,985 --> 00:01:49,676
You're always aggressive.

27
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:55,521
The teacher is here,
but he has ill intentions.

28
00:01:57,187 --> 00:02:00,616
Kamya quit playing games.

29
00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:04,337
Tell me what he aims to do.

30
00:02:10,974 --> 00:02:12,279
Bravo!

31
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:15,529
Let's start.

32
00:02:25,928 --> 00:02:29,859
'Grandpa,
you always wanted me to get educated.'

33
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:33,452
'English Hero is fulfilling your dream.'

34
00:02:34,123 --> 00:02:37,659
'Bless me, so I won't let him down.'

35
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:50,820
Why are you sitting there?
Sit here.

36
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:53,249
Let's study on the bed.

37
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:03,912
Teacher, where do we start?

38
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:12,463
Let's start from here.

39
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:19,816
What are you doing?

40
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,495
I mean, your mind.

41
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,649
That's it.
Use your mind.

42
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:29,207
Let's do this.

43
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,080
Look, M...

44
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:38,772
M for monkey.

45
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,013
Teacher, you stink of alcohol.

46
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:43,726
That's not alcohol,

47
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:46,434
but a potion to boost my brain.

48
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:49,435
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

49
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,395
Go on.

50
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,125
Write.
Let me show you.

51
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:34,790
Have you no shame?
What are you doing?

52
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:36,845
I'll tell my family.

53
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:38,184
Stop, listen to me.

54
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:42,909
Yes, I'm worried if
Nandini creates mischief.

55
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:46,416
She's restless and childish.

56
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:49,759
English Hero,
I won't study with that man.

57
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:53,782
Listen to me, he...

58
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:56,083
And your drama has begun!

59
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,313
- Come.
- No, heed me...

60
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:00,919
Quiet!
You promised you'd study.

61
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:02,303
- You did, right?
- Yes but...

62
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:04,361
I won't hear anything.

63
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:06,158
I won't go.

64
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:09,041
Why won't you?
You promised you'd study.

65
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:10,511
- Yes but...
- It's decided then.

66
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,583
Stay quiet.

67
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:13,926
- Come in.
- No, I won't...

68
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:15,376
No, listen to me...

69
00:05:15,456 --> 00:05:16,665
- Quiet.
- Sir...

70
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:18,424
Sir, I'm so sorry about this.

71
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:20,338
- She had...
- You don't understand.

72
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:21,952
Quiet.
Stay quiet.

73
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:25,140
Sir, just ignore her.
Be strict.

74
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:27,889
Don't do this.
I'm not pretending.

75
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:29,464
- Listen to me.
- Shut up.

76
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:31,949
I said, quiet.
I am talking.

77
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,067
Sir, don't let her out until
she finishes.

78
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,986
Don't do that.

79
00:05:39,154 --> 00:05:40,865
Listen to me.
Don't leave me.

80
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:42,569
English Hero!

81
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:44,833
English Hero, help me.

82
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:46,137
Don't leave me.

83
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:47,404
Open the door.

84
00:05:47,484 --> 00:05:49,632
English Hero, no...

85
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:52,382
No... English Hero!

86
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,582
- Just give up.
- Leave me.

87
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,071
Your husband left you with me.

88
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:04,872
English Hero!

89
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:12,924
Don't you dare touch me!

90
00:06:14,764 --> 00:06:18,951
You don't know me.
You'll pay for this.

91
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:20,325
Did you push me?

92
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:23,830
Let's see who saves you.

93
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:26,750
English Hero!

94
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:31,364
Help me.

95
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:34,241
Nobody will save you.

96
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:37,256
Let go.
English Hero!

97
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:39,702
Leave me.

98
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,656
English Hero, help!

99
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:42,923
- Shut up.
- Let go.

100
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,225
- No...
- Quiet.

101
00:07:10,882 --> 00:07:12,029
Help!

'Save me.'

105
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:04,910
How dare you touch Nandini?

106
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:25,329
How dare you?

107
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,186
Speak up.

108
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,080
He's not worthy of a teacher.

109
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,765
I can't forgive him
for misbehaving with you.

110
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:22,965
Nandini, avenge your tears.

111
00:10:23,842 --> 00:10:29,047
Thrash him so bad that he'll
never dare to hurt another woman.

112
00:10:36,826 --> 00:10:37,759
Hit him, Nandini.

[Sanskrit chants]

114
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:16,790
He forced himself on me.

115
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:24,287
He tried to rape me.

116
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:28,155
I'm sorry, Nandini.

117
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:32,756
I am such a fool
to have shut the door.

118
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:37,452
I promise, Nandini,

119
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:44,571
I won't let anyone harm you
ever again.

120
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,976
I promise.

and leave.'

I won't spare you alive.

130
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:08,030
How dare you shoot him?

131
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:10,001
I won't spare you.

132
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:17,450
I won't spare you.

You did make a mistake.

138

Tell me who sent you here.

Answer me or I'll kill you.

140
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:05,264
I'll tell you.
It was some Bharadwaj.

What do you mean?

What do you mean by his wife?

00:20:19,446 --> 00:20:25,181
Wearing a 'Mangal Sutra'
means nothing.

186
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,322
Aakash doesn't take you as his wife.

187
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:34,207
Heard that?
Get going now.

188
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:39,525
- But Grandma...
- Stop.

189
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:41,912
Need I speak in English?

190
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,990
We don't need you around.

191
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,976
Spare us and get going.

192
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:50,687
You won't relent.

193
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:54,481
You won't?
Leave.

194
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:57,610
Get out of here.

195
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,956
Hey!

196
00:21:11,548 --> 00:21:12,685
What's going on?

197
00:21:13,261 --> 00:21:16,799
Can't you see?
We're helping your grandson.

198
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,128
Really?

199
00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:19,595
Look at her, Kamya.

200
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:22,852
She's questioning me?

201
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:27,079
Sumitra, you don't need your family.

202
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:32,156
I am a fool
to come running all the time.

203
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,230
Come, Kamya.

204
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:38,851
Move.

205
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:41,948
Aakash!

206
00:21:45,699 --> 00:21:47,377
How did this happen?

207
00:21:58,523 --> 00:21:59,486
Grandma...

208
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:03,464
'No, Nandu,
don't say anything.'

209
00:22:04,277 --> 00:22:06,988
'Let me first find out
why Aunt Kamya did this.'

210
00:22:07,524 --> 00:22:09,186
'Then I'll tell others.'

211
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:13,180
I don't know.

212
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:17,640
I'll get turmeric milk for him.

213
00:22:23,431 --> 00:22:25,531
First, we found a gun in the house.

214
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:29,049
Now...

215
00:22:31,154 --> 00:22:32,853
Aakash got shot.

216
00:22:35,084 --> 00:22:37,647
Who is my grandson's enemy?

217
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,416
Lord Ram,

218
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:44,627
keep Aakash safe.

219
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:10,867
Village girl, you want to kill me?

220
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:16,302
No, I'm not proving anything.

221
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:18,437
I'm here to tell you

222
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,248
so you can tell your shooter,
Nandu has his gun.

223
00:23:24,668 --> 00:23:28,023
I challenge him to come get it.

224
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,005
What rubbish?

225
00:23:30,296 --> 00:23:32,563
Are you implying I know that goon?

226
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,255
Are you casting doubts on me?

227
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:39,173
No, I know for sure
you know the goon.

228
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,452
Why do you want to
kill my husband?

229
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:46,269
He's like a son to you.
You raised him.

230
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:49,160
You are his aunt.

231
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:51,661
Then why kill him?

232
00:23:54,985 --> 00:23:56,766
How dare you question me?

233
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:03,023
Don't talk too much
or I'll slit your tongue.

234
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:05,464
You don't know me.

235
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:08,369
I am Kamya.

236
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:12,080
And Kamya doesn't stay quiet.

237
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,454
Out of my way.

238
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:22,816
I don't want Kamya to stay quiet.

239
00:24:24,271 --> 00:24:27,065
She should blurt out
why she wanted to kill my husband.

240
00:24:28,978 --> 00:24:34,538
I promise, by tomorrow
morning, I will make you confess

241
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,663
why you tried to kill my husband?
