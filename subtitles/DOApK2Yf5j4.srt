00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,853
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,853 --> 00:00:04,384
On the night of December 3, 1984, 
at approximately midnight,

3
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:07,026
In Bhopal's train station Bhopal Junction 

4
00:00:07,026 --> 00:00:09,195
the station superintendent H.S. Bhurvey

5
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:11,304
and the deputy station superintendent

6
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:14,205
Ghulam Dastagir were on duty.

7
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:15,997
Around 1 o'clock,

8
00:00:15,997 --> 00:00:19,240
the Gorakhpur-Bombay Express arrived at the station,

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,664
prompting Dastagir to leave his cabin.

10
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:26,898
Suddenly, he experienced burning eyes and a sore throat.

11
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:31,972
Concerned, he searched for Bhurvey, 
his superior, to inform him about this,

12
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:33,393
but couldn't find him.

13
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:36,935
Moments later, he found Bhurvey lying on the ground.

14
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:39,936
Dastagir tried to check whether he was breathing,

15
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:42,499
but realized that Bhurvey had passed away.

16
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:46,081
Dastagir immediately understood the cause

17
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:50,335
The thing is that, a kilometre away from Bhopal Junction,

18
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:52,618
in the Union Carbide factory

19
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:54,850
there had been a hazardous incident,

20
00:00:56,318 --> 00:01:01,632
releasing 50,000 pounds of poisonous gas,

21
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:05,843
including MIC, hydrogen cyanide, and phosgene.

22
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:10,336
The gases were spreading rapidly all over the city.

23
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:13,668
As the most senior person present, Dastagir took charge,

24
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:20,708
deciding that the Gorakhpur-bound train 
needed to leave before its scheduled departure,

25
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:24,499
even though it was supposed to 
stay at the station for 20 more minutes.

26
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:27,080
The passengers of the train had the windows closed,

27
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,079
and Dastagir didn't want 

28
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,381
the passengers to be harmed in any way.

29
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:33,767
With passengers' safety in mind, 
Dastagir broke protocol

30
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:38,083
and ordered the station staff to 
clear the way for an early departure.

31
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:42,315
And he assumed all responsibilities of breaking this protocol.

32
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:46,622
Meanwhile, the crowd at the station was growing.

33
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:50,091
The incident occurred during the night 
when most people were asleep at home.

34
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:52,224
Some individuals, facing difficulty breathing,

35
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:56,742
took refuge in their cars and tried to leave the city.

36
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,161
But on the other hand, those without vehicles

37
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,079
gathered at the station,

38
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,979
unsure of what to do.

39
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:06,962
More and more people kept coming to Bhopal Junction.

40
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:11,657
People were coughing, crying, 
and vomiting all around the station.

41
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:15,231
Dastagir was running from one platform to the other,

42
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:19,227
trying to help the people in any way he could.

43
00:02:19,227 --> 00:02:22,125
He made an SOS call to the nearby stations,

44
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:27,474
after which, 4 ambulances, paramedics, and 
railway doctors reached the station to help people.

45
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:30,723
Despite all efforts, escaping the poisonous gas proved challenging.

46
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:48,105
While on one hand, some had fled 
their homes to reach the station,

47
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:51,942
on the other hand, more people headed to hospitals.

48
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:57,209
Obviously, if someone experiences burning eyes 
and breathing difficulties while sleeping at night,

49
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,019
they'll go to a hospital.

50
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:00,612
However, the challenge was that

51
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:03,824
neither the railway doctors nor the hospital staff understood

52
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:05,262
the nature of the situation.

53
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:08,401
These symptoms were unfamiliar to them,

54
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:13,031
and they struggled to identify the illness or its cause.

55
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,941
3 km from the Union Carbide factory,

56
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:17,995
was Bhopal's Hamidia Hospital.

57
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:22,316
At the time, the hospital had a capacity of approximately 1,200 beds.

58
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:24,224
Around 1:15 AM,

59
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:26,552
the first patient arrived,

60
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:29,530
complaining of eye irritation.

61
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,471
Within the next five minutes,

62
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:34,930
over 1000 people had gathered at the hospital.

63
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,077
Some doctors attempted to obtain 
information from the union carbide factory

64
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:42,870
but they didn't provide any useful information. 

65
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,864
The company's medical officer, L.D. Loya told the doctors

66
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:48,009
that the gas was not poisonous

67
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:51,695
and advised the application of 
wet bandages to the eyes.

68
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:55,458
Meanwhile, the Superintendent of Police, 
Swaraj Puri, visited the control room 

69
00:03:55,458 --> 00:04:00,644
and saw that his staff was coughing 
helplessly and rubbing their eyes.

70
00:04:00,644 --> 00:04:03,616
That was around 1:25 AM.

71
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:06,091
He called the carbide factory.

72
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:08,181
on the first two phone calls, 
he received assurances of

73
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,170
everything being okay.

74
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,197
However, after the third call,

75
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:13,893
the response was uncertain:

76
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:15,603
the people at the factory claimed that 
they didn't know what had happened.

77
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:17,262
"We don't know what has happened."

78
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:19,714
By 2:10 AM,

79
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:24,077
the hospital had admitted around 4,000 patients,

80
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:27,349
and chaos was unfolding at Bhopal Junction Station.

81
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:31,390
Dastagir had ensured that the 
Gorakhpur Bombay Express had left the station,

82
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,654
but aiding people became increasingly challenging.

83
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:37,809
He later learned that his senior, H.S. Bhurvey,

84
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:41,695
had lost his life while directing another train to leave Bhopal,

85
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:45,877
his senior had instructed the train not to stop at the platform.

86
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:48,152
And to keep moving.

87
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:50,612
Ghulam Dastagir, his wife, and their 4 children,

88
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:52,839
lived in old Bhopal.

89
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:57,217
Merely 3 km from the Union Carbide factory.

90
00:04:57,217 --> 00:05:00,807
But Dasgir didn't leave the station to check on his family.

91
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:03,929
He remained at the station, 
dedicated to assisting those in need.

92
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:07,757
Trains arriving at the station were prevented from stopping

93
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:08,842
they were asked to keep going.

94
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:12,280
Manzoor Ahmed Khan, Dasgir's colleague, was

95
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,629
among the individuals arriving at the station to leave Bhopal.

96
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:18,913
Around 3 AM, he arrived at the station with their entire family.

97
00:05:18,913 --> 00:05:23,129
Observing Dastagir tirelessly moving from platform to platform,

98
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:27,980
assisting people selflessly without concern 
for his own safety or that of his family.

99
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,952
Friends, there is a new series on Netflix,
The Railway Men.

100
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:34,072
Inspired by these real-life stories.

101
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:36,728
How these unknown and unsung heroes

102
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:39,926
were grappling with the poisonous gas that fateful night.

103
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:43,890
This series is the first series by Yash Raj Entertainment to be released on an OTT platform.

104
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,066
Watching the trailer will give you 

105
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:50,836
a clear sense of the suspense and thrill 
embedded in the story of that night in this series.

106
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:54,006
On one hand, the doctors and paramedics at the stations and hospitals

107
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:57,539
were working tirelessly to save lives.

108
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:01,136
On the other hand, they didn't truly know

109
00:06:01,136 --> 00:06:04,001
how to treat the cause of the symptoms. 

110
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:08,547
Most of the doctors administered eye drops 
to reduce the burning sensation in the eyes,

111
00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:10,473
steroids to treat the inflammation,

112
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:13,841
and antibiotics to prevent secondary infection,

113
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:16,595
and antacids to treat stomach problems.

114
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:18,874
The real solution, though,

115
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:21,473
depended on identifying the gas.

116
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:26,228
Whether it was MIC, Phosgene, 
or another gas like hydrogen cyanide.

117
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:28,875
Initially, doctors suspected phosgene poisoning,

118
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:32,982
because there was a similar incident 3 years prior to this

119
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:35,822
in the same Union Carbide factory.

120
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:37,943
In December 1981,

121
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:41,325
resulting in the d3ath of a person working in 
this factory, Ashraf Muhammad Khan.

122
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:43,338
Due to a phosgene leak.

123
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:47,957
Conversely, the company downplayed the severity, claiming it was MIC

124
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:51,080
and advising simple remedies like wet bandages for eye irritation.

125
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,241
Notably, MIC vaporizes at 38°C,

126
00:06:54,241 --> 00:06:56,046
a considerably high temperature. 

127
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:59,287
Whereas phosgene vaporizes at 8°C.

128
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:01,608
Given the December climate in Bhopal,

129
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:04,307
doctors assumed phosgene to be the culprit,

130
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:08,037
No one knew that at the time of this incident in the factory,

131
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:11,725
the factory's temperature was around 400°C.

132
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:14,847
Meanwhile, in America, Carbide's medical director, Bipin Awasia,

133
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:16,641
informed Bhopal authorities

134
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:18,881
that if cyanide poisoning was suspected,

135
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:23,190
sodium thiosulfate should be administered as an antidote.

136
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,834
In earlier experiments it was observed that

137
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:29,805
MIC breaks down into hydrogen cyanide during combustion,

138
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:35,229
And hydrogen cyanide could be countered 
effectively by sodium thiosulfate.

139
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:41,983
But Bipin Awasia retracted his statement 10 days 
later during a press conference in Bhopal,

140
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:44,538
asserting that there was no cyanide poisoning,

141
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:46,291
rendering the antidote useless.

142
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,545
The company issued a statement

143
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:50,827
clarifying that MIC is not cyanide,

144
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:52,610
and that the two should not be confused.

145
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,769
emphasizing that MIC naturally degrades into the environment

146
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,515
when exposed to water.

147
00:07:57,515 --> 00:08:00,425
However, this clarification from the company was very late.

148
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:04,998
by then, numerous patients were 
in the hospital awaiting treatment.

149
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,251
To help the distressed patients,

150
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:11,041
on December 8th, German toxicologist Max Daunderer,

151
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:15,143
arrived in Bhopal with 50,000 doses of sodium thiosulfate.

152
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:18,289
When doctors used sodium thiosulfate, 

153
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,722
it proved quite successful,

154
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:23,340
with many patients recovering.

155
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,143
Unfortunately, one patient d!ed after its administration.

156
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:27,460
This led to widespread rumours that

157
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,412
a German doctor had k!lled a patient with sodium thiosulfate.

158
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:35,724
Consequently, the doctor and his antidotes were sent back.

159
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:40,744
Senior professors at Gandhi Medical College 
rejected the use of sodium thiosulfate.

160
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:45,220
Dr. M. N. Nagu, the director of Madhya Pradesh's health services at the time,

161
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,484
published a circular on 13th December stating that

162
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:51,618
"under no circumstances shall sodium thiosulfate be given

163
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:55,077
unless it is correctly and conclusively proved in the laboratory 

164
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,995
that it is cyanide poisoning."

165
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,065
Despite this stance, some remained convinced that

166
00:08:59,065 --> 00:09:01,295
these patients were suffering from cyanide poisoning.

167
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:05,130
First because when sodium thiosulfate 
was being administered on some patients,

168
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,689
positive effects were observed.

169
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:12,435
And second because when Bhopal Medical 
Legal Institute's Director, Dr Hirish Chandra, 

170
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:14,007
conducted autopsies on the bodies,

171
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,727
he found evidence of cyanide poisoning.

172
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:19,890
He reiterated that sodium thiosulfate should be used.

173
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,031
Weeks later, in February,

174
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:24,362
ICMR instructed doctors

175
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:26,406
to use sodium thiosulfate.

176
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:30,106
The biggest question here was:
Why was there so much confusion?

177
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:33,412
The company that owned the factory,

178
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:37,461
why did they create so much confusion
about MIC and cyanide?

179
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:39,636
The direct answer is:

180
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:42,228
The company was in the midst of a huge compensation claim,

181
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:46,463
they wanted to minimize the side effects of MIC to save money.

182
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:49,081
Government authorities were also caught in this confusion,

183
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:52,729
resulting in the unfortunate d3ath of many 
individuals who could have been saved

184
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:55,845
had they received the correct and timely treatment.

185
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:59,246
Ghulam Dasgir, the person I talked about at the beginning of this video,

186
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:01,646
managed to save himself.

187
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:04,346
But the last 19 years of his life

188
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:07,038
were mostly spent in the hospital,

189
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:09,736
he passed away in 2003.

190
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:13,392
What makes the Bhopal gas tragedy 
particularly shocking is that

191
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:19,100
numerous warnings by various people 
had been given before the incident.

192
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,400
Many had voiced concerns,

193
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,268
alerting authorities that the factory posed a constant danger

194
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:25,005
due to the lack of safety measures.

195
00:10:25,005 --> 00:10:28,241
Regrettably, neither the company nor the government authorities

196
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:29,973
took any preventive action.

197
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:34,711
In 1981, when Ashraf Khan lost his life in a Carbide accident,

198
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:39,849
three experts from the US, were sent
by the company in May 1982,

199
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:43,304
to assess the plant's safety measures.

200
00:10:43,304 --> 00:10:47,678
Their report identified over 60 hazards,

201
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:49,249
highlighting issues such as

202
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:54,890
the emergency evacuation procedures weren't 
shared with the people living near the factory.

203
00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:00,370
and that the MIC tanks could be easily contaminated.

204
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,446
The tank pressure gauge was apparently defective.

205
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:06,342
The issues and warnings raised in this report

206
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:08,170
were published in three articles.

207
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,761
[Save This City]

208
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:13,274
[Bhopal is Sitting on a Volcano's Mouth]

209
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:16,670
[You'll Perish If You Don't Take This Seriously] 

210
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,511
These articles were published in a local newspaper, Rajpath

211
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:24,484
by a journalist Rajkumar Keswani within two weeks,

212
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:28,403
Keshwani's last article on the Bhopal plant,

213
00:11:28,403 --> 00:11:31,396
was published on June 16, 1984,

214
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:33,523
in the national newspaper Jansatta,

215
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:38,735
warning of a situation of looming disaster in Bhopal.

216
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:41,081
This underscores the vital role of

217
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:44,436
independent and free media in the country.

218
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:47,914
The truth is, Keswani didn't do anything extraordinary. 

219
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:51,902
He simply carried out his job with honesty.

220
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:55,160
And that's why, today he emerges as an unsung hero.

221
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,067
In his last article, he made another major revelation,

222
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:01,486
that in 1975, Bhopal Municipal Corporation

223
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:05,137
was headed by a highly respected bureaucrat MN Buch.

224
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:08,900
He had issued a notice to remove Carbide from Bhopal.

225
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,040
Consequently, Buch was transferred,

226
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,613
and Carbide paid ₹25,000 to the Corporation

227
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:17,562
for the construction of a public park.

228
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,754
With this Keswani hinted at

229
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:23,164
a collusion within the government to aid Carbide

230
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:25,825
in successfully continuing its factory operations.

231
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,220
Similar narratives are explored in The Railwaymen series,

232
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,078
you can watch it on Netflix.

233
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,358
For a deeper understanding of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy,

234
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:37,279
and the subsequent developments involving the company,

235
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,837
and the events leading to the incident that night,

236
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:44,683
I have explained these in this video.

237
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:47,663
