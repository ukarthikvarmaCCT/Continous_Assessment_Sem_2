00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,984
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:06,584
In 1989, Bollywood stars Vinod Khanna, Amjad Khan, and Dimple Kapadia,

3
00:00:06,584 --> 00:00:08,770
were shooting for a film.

4
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:10,879
This film was named Lekin.

5
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:14,378
A drama-mystery Bollywood film on ghosts.

6
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:16,367
The story was about the spirit of a woman

7
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:19,085
being trapped in a palace, looking for salvation.

8
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,676
This film was being shot in a palace in Jaipur.

9
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:24,149
One day, on an otherwise normal day of shooting,

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,541
after the shots were over, people packed up,

11
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:27,878
the sun had set, night had fallen,

12
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:31,231
and Dimple Kapadia was snug in her bed.

13
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:36,392
She says that she saw a woman sitting beside her on the bed.

14
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:38,121
She talked to the woman,

15
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,330
and she had this eerie feeling that the woman was a ghost.

16
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:44,414
This is just one example.

17
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:47,595
But you will find hundreds of thousands of examples all over the world,

18
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:50,630
where people claim to have seen ghosts and spirits,

19
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,889
and even talked to them.

20
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:56,289
Many people report that they went through paranormal experiences.

21
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,213
So many films have been made on this.

22
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:00,065
The Conjuring,
The Exorcist, 

23
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:02,081
The Exorcism of Emily Rose.

24
00:01:02,081 --> 00:01:04,987
These films claim to have been
"inspired from real events".

25
00:01:04,987 --> 00:01:06,413
There have been so many TV shows,

26
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:09,485
Ghosthunters, where people equipped with sophisticated instruments,

27
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:11,022
go on a hunt to catch ghosts.

28
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:14,852
They use technology to prove that ghosts exist.

29
00:01:14,852 --> 00:01:19,493
And some people make YouTube videos of talking to the spirits of dead people.

30
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:22,360
Such as American paranormal expert Steve Huff,

31
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,259
he claims to have talked to the spirit of the Late Sushant Singh Rajput.

32
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,200
What's the truth behind all this?

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,598
Come, in today's video, let's try to understand this.

34
00:01:31,546 --> 00:01:33,784
"This is the live testimony of Sushant's spirit."

35
00:01:33,784 --> 00:01:34,750
"School for Ghosts."

36
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,316
"Do ghosts and spirits really exist?"

37
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:39,476
"There are places that are still feared by people.

38
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:42,755
It's said that this place is haunted by ghosts at night."

39
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:46,126
"It is truly extraordinary, unimaginable, unbelievable."

40
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:55,362
First of all, let's keep aside the events that have an obvious reason. 

41
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:57,546
Such as the famous case of the Fox Sisters.

42
00:01:57,546 --> 00:01:59,499
In the 1800s, in America,

43
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:02,264
three sisters were very famous among the spiritual people.

44
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,668
These three sisters were known as the Fox Sisters,

45
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,264
And people claimed that from a very young age,

46
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:11,607
these three sisters could communicate with ghosts and spirits.

47
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:14,148
When people wanted to communicate with someone's spirit,

48
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:15,553
they'd go to these sisters.

49
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:17,765
These sisters would ask questions to the spirits,

50
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:21,801
and in response, they could hear the walls of their room banging.

51
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:25,128
Sometimes they would see messages on blank cards.

52
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:27,607
Their "spirit-talking" sessions

53
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:29,532
where they talked to the spirits,

54
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:31,863
were very popular in America back then.

55
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:34,046
These three sisters raked in a lot of money from this.

56
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:37,959
But one day, the husband of one of the sisters died.

57
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:41,160
He was an orthodox Christian and believed these things.

58
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,079
He told his wife to stop doing such things

59
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,287
to stop communicating with spirits,

60
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:49,000
After the death of her husband, the sister went into depression.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,632
She started drinking.

62
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:53,656
And had a falling out with the other two sisters.

63
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:58,149
One day, this sister, publicly confessed

64
00:02:58,149 --> 00:03:02,359
that the three sisters were conning people for a long time.

65
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,678
They didn't talk to ghosts and spirits,

66
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:06,207
they were simply playing small tricks.

67
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:09,518
Such as tying an object with a string and making it fall "unnaturally."

68
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:14,412
Sometimes hitting the walls with their feet to make the banging sounds.

69
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,712
This sister claimed that people were so emotional,

70
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:18,771
that people were willing to accept the delusion

71
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:22,115
people would even "feel" the spirits touching them.

72
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:25,589
Another famous story is of the Amityville Haunted House.

73
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:28,548
In New York, there was a house called Amityville,

74
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,655
a person named Ronny had murdered his family there.

75
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:34,760
When this person was presented in court,

76
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,917
he claimed that he could hear voices in the house.

77
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:40,937
And that he committed the murders under the influence of the ghostly noises.

78
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:43,687
After this, another family moved into this house.

79
00:03:43,687 --> 00:03:45,018
The family of George and Kathy.

80
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:47,666
They claimed to have heard these noises too.

81
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,233
They started seeing ghosts.

82
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:52,371
They witnessed paranormal activities in this house

83
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:54,209
and finally, they had to leave the house.

84
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,132
What was the mystery of this story?

85
00:03:56,313 --> 00:03:58,685
Later, news reports by ABC News showed that

86
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:00,184
they were lying.

87
00:04:00,184 --> 00:04:03,548
The murderer had lied to save himself from the punishment.

88
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:06,000
And the couple that moved in later,

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,902
lied because they thought that

90
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,583
they could earn some good bucks by lying.

91
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,509
They assumed that they would get book deals and film deals.

92
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:16,949
In India, a recent example was seen

93
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:18,702
when a person named Steve Huff claimed

94
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:22,207
that he was communicating with the spirit of the late Sushant Singh Rajput.

95
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:24,842
He recorded his conversation while talking to the spirit

96
00:04:24,842 --> 00:04:26,589
and posted it on YouTube.

97
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:29,484
And because many people were already emotional about this issue.

98
00:04:29,484 --> 00:04:30,591
They were misled.

99
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,197
Several news channels reported on this as well.

100
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:34,559
India TV, Amar Ujala TV,

101
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,049
DNA, News24,

102
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:38,279
as if what was shown in this video was real.

103
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,919
But what had happened here actually?

104
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,017
As revealed by an Instagram user,

105
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:46,960
this person took some clips from an old interview,

106
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,484
where he was interviewed by film critic Anupama Chopra some years ago,

107
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:52,176
audio clips were extracted from there,

108
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:54,123
those audio clips were then manipulated,

109
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:57,583
and played as if it was Sushant Singh Rajput's spirit talking.

110
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,160
And surprisingly friends, hardly did any news channel

111
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,899
run this news where the truth was exposed.

112
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:06,646
Because you get TRP by appeasing the superstitious beliefs of people.

113
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:09,486
They wouldn't get TRP by talking about science and logical things.

114
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:13,102
So let's keep aside such fraudsters and false cases,

115
00:05:13,102 --> 00:05:14,635
where the lies were clearly evident.

116
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:17,601
But what about the cases where people do not lie?

117
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:21,254
What about the films that are inspired by real-life incidents?

118
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,472
In 2017, there was a film called Veronica.

119
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:25,544
In it, it was shown that during a solar eclipse,

120
00:05:25,544 --> 00:05:28,449
Veronica and her friends go to the school basement,

121
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:30,586
and use an Ouija board

122
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:35,623
to contact Veronica's dead father and her dead boyfriend.

123
00:05:35,623 --> 00:05:38,690
This ritual was interrupted by a nun,

124
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,329
then the Ouija board breaks,

125
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:43,204
and a demon possesses Veronica.

126
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:44,387
She gets possessed.

127
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,850
Interestingly, this film claims that

128
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,141
it was inspired by real events.

129
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:49,963
So did this happen in reality?

130
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:53,551
The real story is of a girl named Estefania.

131
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:56,927
This real-life case drew so much attention

132
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:59,266
that even in the police report it was mentioned

133
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:03,169
that there were some paranormal activities at this girl's house.

134
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,559
If you watch such films,

135
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,430
you might also feel that

136
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:09,695
since it is shown in so many films, there would be some truth to it.

137
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,744
Some elements of it would be true at least.

138
00:06:11,744 --> 00:06:13,613
It can't be that all of it is false.

139
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:17,741
Especially when they write that the film is inspired by real events.

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,292
But friends, the point here is that people misunderstand the word 'inspired'.

141
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:25,304
Saying that it is "based on true events"

142
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:28,444
and "inspired by true events", are different.

143
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:31,267
When the director of this film was asked questions about it,

144
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,138
he had clearly said that,

145
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:49,099
This is why the real story and the story depicted in the film

146
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:50,698
have vast differences.

147
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:52,678
In reality, according to the news reports,

148
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,723
the parents of the girl were alive.

149
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:58,334
In the film, it's shown that the girl dies within 3 days.

150
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:02,719
but in reality, the girl Estefania died several months later.

151
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:04,162
after suffering from seizures.

152
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:06,892
Third, in the real story, it cannot be ruled out

153
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:10,686
that Estefania suffered from a psychotic disorder.

154
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,765
A disorder that went undiagnosed by a doctor

155
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:16,186
because they lived in a rural area.

156
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,698
During the 1990s.

157
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:20,823
Back then technology and medical science weren't as advanced as they are now.

158
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:23,066
And finally, after Estefania's death,

159
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:28,357
her parents had claimed to have witnessed paranormal activities around them.

160
00:07:28,357 --> 00:07:30,550
That they could hear their daughter scream.

161
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,766
But when her mother was psychologically examined,

162
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:36,228
it was revealed that she was suffering from emotional instability,

163
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:38,645
anxiety, and need for attention.

164
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:40,651
I am going into the detail of this case,

165
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:43,463
because we often come across such cases.

166
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:49,118
This is a typical example of the cases that inspire horror films.

167
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:52,866
You'd say that even if we suppose one family member had a psychological illness,

168
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:55,452
but if the entire family behaves in such a manner

169
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:58,418
and claim to have witnessed paranormal activity,

170
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:00,122
what would happen in that case?

171
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:03,404
Friends, in such cases, there is a phenomenon known as

172
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:05,559
Mass Psychogenic Illness.

173
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,938
Also known as Shared Psychotic Disorder.

174
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:10,576
We saw this in the famous Burari Case

175
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:13,318
which saw the mass suicide by 11 family members.

176
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:14,708
It was a famous case from Delhi.

177
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:17,836
I talked about this in the video on Monkeyman as well.

178
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:20,663
The secret behind the mystery of the Monkeyman.

179
00:08:20,663 --> 00:08:22,742
I'll put the link to that video in the description

180
00:08:22,742 --> 00:08:23,858
you can go watch it later.

181
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:27,181
Another bizarre case was seen in an Australian family

182
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:30,201
where the family of 5 went on a road trip

183
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:32,729
and suddenly, they suffered from paranoia,

184
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,483
that someone was trying to kill them.

185
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:37,608
Eventually, the family members separated from each other and disappeared.

186
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:39,129
Though they united later,

187
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:43,883
this is said to be a case of Shared Delusional Disorder (SDD),

188
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:46,305
where people who are close to each other,

189
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:49,776
often reinforce each other's delusions.

190
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:53,381
But if you are still interested in horror stories for entertainment,

191
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:56,961
then I'd recommend that you listen to horror stories on KUKU FM.

192
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:59,989
They have horror audiobooks such as Bargad ka Ped.

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,398
It is well-written and thrilling.

194
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:03,489
If you don't know KUKU FM, it is a brilliant audio learning platform

195
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:06,547
on which you can listen to audiobooks from all genres.

196
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,377
From knowledgeable history audiobooks,

197
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:10,106
to such entertaining audiobooks.

198
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:13,947
Normally, it costs ₹399 for the whole year,

199
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,938
but if you use the coupon code DHRUV50,

200
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:18,739
you will get 50% off,

201
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:22,326
It means that it will cost you only ₹199 for the entire year.

202
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:24,179
The link to it is in the description below.

203
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:25,548
You can go try it out.

204
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:28,858
But now, let's talk about stranger phenomenons.

205
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:32,851
Things that will shock you when you find out how these work exactly.

206
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:34,721
First are these Ouija boards.

207
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:39,677
They are spelled OUIJA,

208
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:41,497
but it's pronounced /wee-je/.

209
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,107
You would have seen them in numerous films.

210
00:09:43,107 --> 00:09:45,921
Exorcist, Paranormal Activity, Conjuring 2.

211
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,275
Even in Indian films such as A Death in the Goonj,

212
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:51,627
even in a web series on Zee5,

213
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:55,411
It is basically said to be a medium to communicate with ghosts.

214
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:58,192
There are alphabets and numbers written on this board,

215
00:09:58,192 --> 00:09:59,620
along with yes and no.

216
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,357
And there is a triangular pointer known as Planchet.

217
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:05,717
To use this, people go to a dark place,

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,729
light some candles, close their eyes

219
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:11,722
and request the spirits to come to them.

220
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:15,154
In case a spirit is around them, they call it to communicate with them.

221
00:10:15,154 --> 00:10:17,441
Then the people place their hands on this pointer.

222
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:19,501
And ask questions to the spirits.

223
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:22,135
If the spirit wants to answer with a yes or no,

224
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:27,617
then their hands on the triangular pointer start moving toward the answer.

225
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,453
Friends, it is interesting to note that

226
00:10:29,453 --> 00:10:32,376
people do not move their hands on their own.

227
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:34,749
Some people may be those that are just having fun with it,

228
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:38,909
but there are many people who use the Ouija boards

229
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:41,296
but do not move their hands on their own.

230
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:43,927
Their hands start moving on their own.

231
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:49,118
"Spirits, can you speak to us?

232
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:50,587
Are you there?"

233
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:57,905
And they believe that the spirits control their hands, making them move.

234
00:10:57,905 --> 00:10:59,546
And that they are communicating with the spirits.

235
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:00,808
How can this be possible?

236
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:03,533
There is a scientific phenomenon to this.

237
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:05,100
Ideomotor Effect.

238
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,447
Ideomotor Effect is a psychological phenomenon

239
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:10,757
where we move our bodies unconsciously.

240
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:13,468
Without our conscious self being aware of it.

241
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:16,813
For example, our hand starts moving, but we don't even know it.

242
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:19,912
Often, you would notice that when you go to sleep,

243
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,357
moments before you fall asleep,

244
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:25,199
you feel that you're falling.

245
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:26,839
You slipped and now you're falling.

246
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,652
And then you're jerked awake.

247
00:11:28,652 --> 00:11:31,224
This is known as the Hypnic Jerk.

248
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:34,084
Your body moves unconsciously.

249
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:36,241
It thinks that it is falling from somewhere.

250
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:38,309
And that causes the jerk.

251
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:40,929
A hypnic jerk is different from the Ideomotor effect.

252
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:42,365
But they are similar.

253
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:44,611
The difference is that you experience a hypnic jerk

254
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:45,931
when you are about to fall asleep.

255
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:49,735
But you can witness the ideomotor effect while you're awake.

256
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:54,896
If your hand is moving on its own on the Ouija board,

257
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,920
this is an example of an ideomotor effect.

258
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,410
Your brain signals your body to move in that way

259
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,038
but your consciousness doesn't even know this.

260
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:04,837
If you want an example of this,

261
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:08,287
you can experience this right now, wherever you are.

262
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:09,742
Take a pendulum.

263
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:13,260
If you don't have that, take a light weight and attach it to a string.

264
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,745
It can be your button, or your ring,

265
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:17,937
tie it to a string.

266
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,094
Since I have none of this, let me use this charger for this example.

267
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:24,410
This works like a pendulum now.

268
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:26,535
It's oscillating already.

269
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:28,900
What you need to do is,

270
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,285
place your hand in front of yourself.

271
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:33,463
And this weight is normally oscillating.

272
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:37,726
Think to yourself that you need to make it move in a clockwise direction.

273
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,445
Move it in the clockwise direction,

274
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:45,349
And eventually, you'll see that it starts moving in the same direction on its own.

275
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,767
This isn't working quite as well with a charger

276
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,362
because it isn't as thin as a string.

277
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:52,327
But you can see the movement here.

278
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:56,206
And now if you want to make it move in the anti-clockwise direction.

279
00:12:56,206 --> 00:13:00,199
It starts moving anticlockwise, without you needing to do anything.

280
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,459
you aren't moving it consciously,

281
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,977
But since your brain wants to make it move anti-clockwise,

282
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,680
you can see it moving in that direction.

283
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,053
Try it out for yourself.

284
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:12,409
People who really believe in Ouija boards,

285
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:15,559
who believe that they are really talking to spirits,

286
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:19,084
their brain creates subconscious images and memories

287
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:22,900
of the person, the spirit that has passed on.

288
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,596
When they ask questions, their brain uses those memories and images to respond,

289
00:13:29,031 --> 00:13:33,083
and their brain subconsciously tells their body to move.

290
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,619
There have been several scientific studies into this.

291
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:37,664
There's a simple Blindfold Test for this.

292
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:42,352
If a spirit was the one to move that planchet,

293
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:44,434
even when people are blindfolded,

294
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:46,055
when people have their eyes closed,

295
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:49,397
the planchet should move in the correct way.

296
00:13:49,397 --> 00:13:53,175
But what happens actually, instead of moving in the right way,

297
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:55,527
the pointer gives absurd responses.

298
00:13:55,672 --> 00:13:58,360
If people do not know where Yes or No is,

299
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,928
they start pointing the pointer randomly.

300
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:05,549
We see the same ideomotor effect on people who claim that they are possessed.

301
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,994
That there's a spirit in them.

302
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:10,396
Not every case is a lie.

303
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:14,279
if they think that they are possessed and start behaving so,

304
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,862
it is actually possible that their body is making the movements unconsciously,

305
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:20,573
without them being aware of it.

306
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:24,521
That's why they might think that they are possessed.

307
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:27,079
Since their body starts moving without their control.

308
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,247
It is the act of the subconscious mind.

309
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:38,360
Similarly, some people claim that they are gifted with automatic writing.

310
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,126
That they can communicate with spirits

311
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:42,808
who make their hands move to write things.

312
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:44,113
It's the same thing.

313
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:46,988
Most of the people who make such claims are obviously lying.

314
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,995
But the ones that are telling the truth,

315
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:52,127
are victims of this ideomotor effect.

316
00:14:52,127 --> 00:14:54,000
But let's keep the ideomotor effect to a side,

317
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,458
what about the ghosthunters that carry sophisticated equipment to catch ghosts.

318
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,281
Let's analyse that as well.

319
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:05,439
Often, the cameras used by the ghosthunters is an infrared cameras.

320
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:07,580
Which captures thermal patterns.

321
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,997
They capture the spirits with these cameras,

322
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:12,388
which makes it seem like a negative photograph.

323
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:23,081
In reality, friends, whenever there is a change in temperature

324
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:25,989
you can see it quite clearly through an infrared camera.

325
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:27,822
Think about it, if you sit on a chair and

326
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:30,589
rub your back on the back of the chair,

327
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:32,452
it will generate some heat,

328
00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:36,287
If you get up and see the chair with an infrared camera,

329
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:38,821
it will seem like someone is sitting on the chair.

330
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:43,017
When in reality, the chair has some heat residue.

331
00:15:43,017 --> 00:15:48,715
Another interesting example is if you come out of the bathroom with wet feet,

332
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:51,809
if you walk on the floor and look at it through an infrared camera,

333
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:54,020
it will look like the footprints of a spirit.

334
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,556
Because the temperature of your feet would be different than the rest of your body.

335
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,846
Look at this interesting video, explaining it in detail.

336
00:16:00,846 --> 00:16:04,239
"Perhaps you are sitting around the dining room table, having a séance.

337
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,981
Calling on spirits from the past,

338
00:16:07,315 --> 00:16:08,348
when a pattern you might catch could be

339
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:10,152
someone that was sitting on a chair perhaps.

340
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,873
Another thought that came to mind,

341
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:14,140
maybe it was a crew member from one of those shows

342
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,988
leaning up against the wall.

343
00:16:19,537 --> 00:16:21,672
In this shot here, my thermal reflection

344
00:16:21,672 --> 00:16:23,925
as I walk across a wood floor in a home

345
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,024
could be mistaken for something else."

346
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:30,166
In addition to this, these ghost hunters carry an EMF meter with them.

347
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,347
the EMF meter is an interesting thing.

348
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:35,750
If you have a cell phone or two-way radio around you,

349
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,725
or any kind of electronic device really,

350
00:16:38,218 --> 00:16:40,613
which emits electromagnetic waves,

351
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:43,276
this meter would show a reading.

352
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:46,321
from a computer mouse to a camera battery pack,

353
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:49,102
anything can make this meter fluctuate all over the place.

354
00:16:49,102 --> 00:16:51,547
They use motion sensor lights often.

355
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:54,705
Even if a mouse is passing through an abandoned building,

356
00:16:54,705 --> 00:16:56,306
it will turn on the motion sensor,

357
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,444
and they will use it to claim that they spotted a spirit.

358
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:02,477
By using these technical devices, the nonsense that's often sprout,

359
00:17:02,477 --> 00:17:07,426
is presented on the TV as if they have really spotted ghosts.

360
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,406
It is done in America as well as India.

361
00:17:10,406 --> 00:17:12,000
In many countries, in fact.

362
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,394
There's a TV show in Aaj Tak Adhbut,

363
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:16,907
"Supernatural, Unimaginable, Unbelievable."

364
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,446
They show some VFX with some background horror music,

365
00:17:20,446 --> 00:17:24,000
and the anchor Sweta Singh presents ghosts and spirits to people.

366
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,169
"Ages pass by, but some questions remain unanswered."

367
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:32,937
If these people can find a nanochip in the ₹2,000 currency note,

368
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:34,559
they can find spirits as well.

369
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,775
But what can they do?

370
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:37,751
Showing ghosts on TV attracts TRP.

371
00:17:38,052 --> 00:17:41,558
Showing ghosts in cinemas earns them some nice box office collections.

372
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:44,867
And now even YouTubers have started showing stories of ghosts.

373
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:47,026
Actually, it isn't wrong to do these.

374
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:50,846
As long as these are presented solely as entertainment.

375
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:52,778
I enjoy watching horror films.

376
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:54,455
They give a different kind of thrill.

377
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:56,772
The fear that it brings is quite enjoyable.

378
00:17:56,772 --> 00:18:01,007
But if a TV show, film or a YouTuber claims that

379
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:03,530
they have definitely spotted a ghost,

380
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,257
And that ghosts and spirits are real,

381
00:18:05,257 --> 00:18:06,525
it is complete nonsense.

382
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:08,488
It is nice to entertain people.

383
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:11,626
But to make false promises to people, and to fool them,

384
00:18:11,626 --> 00:18:13,963
by encouraging superstition,

385
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:15,163
is absolutely wrong.

386
00:18:15,163 --> 00:18:17,370
But what about the Dimple Kapadia case

387
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,062
that I mentioned at the beginning of this video?

388
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,541
Friends, the thing is that in the film Lekin,

389
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,079
Dimple was playing the role herself.

390
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,329
The role of the ghost.

391
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:27,912
Her character was based on it.

392
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:30,104
When she experienced the ghost encounter,

393
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:33,341
She went and told this to Padmini Devi, the erstwhile princess.

394
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:38,756
She replied that Dimple had been shooting the entire day as a ghost,

395
00:18:38,756 --> 00:18:41,381
so it wasn't out of the ordinary that it was stuck on her mind,

396
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:44,022
which then caused the delusion.

397
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,113
I said, "Listen Dimps, the thing is,

398
00:18:46,229 --> 00:18:49,440
that you are shooting all day as a ghost.

399
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,953
So, therefore, at night, I'm sure you woke up

400
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,561
and you thought that there was somebody else with you."

401
00:18:56,561 --> 00:18:58,248
Keep your wits about you when it comes to such things.

402
00:18:58,248 --> 00:18:59,496
