1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,252
 1.5 minutes Remaining

2
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,373
Two coffees, no sugar.

3
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:38,180
What's up guys?

4
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,696
Welcome back to the vlog.

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,804
This is the exact same location where,

6
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:45,393
Last time in 2019 we
started our vlog from here and

7
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:47,440
today in 2023 also we are
starting our vlog from here.

8
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:54,902
It's 10:50 am, we landed at 10.30 am,

9
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:57,745
picked up the car from the airport
and now we're going to Sriharikota,

10
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,962
which is 3 hours away from here.

11
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:01,536
Let's see, if the journey speed is right on the way then we'll stop and have a cup of tea.

12
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:04,082
So, I asked my dad if he remembers the last one or not,

13
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:05,488
he even remembers the exact date.

14
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:06,609
It's been 4 years, dad says.

15
00:01:06,705 --> 00:01:08,233
- On 22th July, 2019.

16
00:01:13,805 --> 00:01:16,437
 It's 12:30 pm and we have a launch at 2:30 pm.

17
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:19,275
Our plan is to reach there by 2 pm so that we can settle better.

18
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,640
Last time we reached exactly 5 minutes before the time.

19
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:23,786
As soon as we sit..

20
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,035
- Take this one.

21
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:25,614
- Thank you.

22
00:01:26,677 --> 00:01:27,981
I had tea, but my heart is not satisfied.

23
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,011
- Anna

24
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:29,563
- Two more.

25
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:30,588
Without sugar.

26
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:31,344
Thank you, Anna.

27
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:32,916
- You are going to Sriharikota?

28
00:01:33,153 --> 00:01:34,101
For the launch?

29
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:34,725
Evening coming.

30
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:37,278
So, dad there are two types of fuels in a rocket.

31
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:39,721
One is a solid fuel and the other is a liquid fuel.

32
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:41,499
- You know, what is the difference?

33
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:42,490
- No, i don't know.

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,736
- Liquid fuel as we drank tea.

35
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:44,968
So our liquid fuel is done already.

36
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:45,693
- Okay
- Haha..

37
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:46,822
Shiven has come from Chennai,

38
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:49,154
but unfortunately, very few passes have been issued this time.

39
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:49,634
- Yes

40
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:51,645
Booked too shortly and too early.

41
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:53,497
Will try to see from outside.

42
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:54,404
Let's meet there.

43
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:55,626
- Did you go to watch Chandrayaan 2?

44
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:56,616
- No.

45
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:58,240
Do you know the difference between chandrayaan 2 and 3?

46
00:01:59,293 --> 00:01:59,793
- Ummm,

47
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,436
I think this time Orbiter,

48
00:02:01,757 --> 00:02:02,830
won't be launched
- yes

49
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:06,942
And Lander and Rover are launching this time.

50
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:07,488
Guys,

51
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,713
 India's Chandrayaan-2 mission, was not able to land to the surface of the moon after getting very close to it.

52
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,516
 So, now we are sending Chandrayaan-3.

53
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,734
But what is the difference between Chandrayaan-2 and Chandrayaan-3?

54
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:22,401
With Chandrayaan-2, an orbiter was also sent which is still functioning perfectly

55
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:26,377
That's why there is no need to send that orbiter in Chandrayaan-3.

56
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:30,210
Now, if the orbiter is not going, then we have more space to send more stuff.

57
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:31,796
So, the scientists have decided that,

58
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,294
the landing rover of Chandrayaan-3,

59
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:37,065
it's landing gear will be made stronger

60
00:02:37,308 --> 00:02:38,781
and it will have a special quality

61
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:42,654
 that it can change its landing spot till the last minute.

62
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:44,696
From right here is to Sriharikota,

63
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:46,437
I have seen a lot of cars today.

64
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:47,508
- How many kilometers from here?

65
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,817
It's 37 minutes, 24 kilometers.

66
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:51,778
You Last time we came on the same road.

67
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:55,821
We thought there was a lake on the side because it was raining heavily.

68
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:58,613
-When my father and I came, there was no one, 
- Yes, we were going alone

69
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,559
this road was completely lonely and quiet.

70
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:02,752
All the cars are moving forward.

71
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:04,188
Now, there is a little water

72
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:06,292
- Last time it felt like we were going in the middle of the sea.

73
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,265
This time it's better, clouds are not that much.

74
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:12,412
Last time when it launched, in 10 seconds it went into the clouds

75
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:14,317
And then there was only sound.

76
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,230
Didn't show up again after that.

77
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,454
- Did you start seeing from here?

78
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:18,166
- On the right side,
- where the poles are?

79
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,736
- Hmm..

80
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,381
- Where these four poles are fixed
- Yes these four poles are fixed

81
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:21,277
- Yeah, this is.

82
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,970
There's a college bus, Loyla college.

83
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:33,109
This time proper family bus has comed with

84
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:34,254
Family, kids.

85
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:35,112
- It's showing red.

86
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:35,956
- Oh my god.

87
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,141
- The bus is full of kids.

88
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,922
There's so much crowd, last time in 2019 there was no crowd

89
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:43,245
This year there's so much crowd

90
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:45,250
I think if they sell ticket for 100-150 rupees

91
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:46,861
We'll have our budget.

92
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:48,034
Anna, going for launch?

93
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:48,922
Rocket launch?

94
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:50,335
Do you have a ticket?

95
00:03:50,794 --> 00:03:51,910
- No ticket
- No ticket

96
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:52,992
Dad, what's the time?

97
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:54,361
There was a lot of crowd.

98
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:57,043
And on the way there was a complete traffic of vehicles on the road,

99
00:03:57,068 --> 00:04:00,209
We thought we'd have to watch this launch from the road.

100
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:04,889
Everyone is sitting. Let's go, let's go.

101
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:06,194
Scooters are the best.

102
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:08,971
These people are on foot Will reach, but We'll keep sitting like this.

103
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:11,757
Dad, we can't reach today. It's looking difficult.

104
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:12,331
- No.

105
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:15,145
It's liker a village fair. Everyone has come today.

106
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,293
If they sell a ticket, they will get all the money for Chandrayaan 3.

107
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:20,202
They will collect more.

108
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:22,520
Send two tickets. So many people have come to see.

109
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:23,894
There's so much crowd here.

110
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:24,800
ISRO is thinking about

111
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:28,450
when Chandrayaan 4 launches, they should run the metro from outside.

112
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:29,476
Because there's a lot of crowd.

113
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,390
Everyone is getting off and going by  walking.

114
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,566
We thought we might miss our launch.

115
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,234
So dad says, son, you get off on foot.

116
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,330
I'll take the car and meet you somewhere.

117
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:41,994
I said, dad, there's no signal. If we get lost, we won't find eachother

118
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:44,381
He said, last year we saw it together.

119
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:46,508
Whatever happens this year, we'll do it together.

120
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,772
Everyone is getting off.

121
00:04:50,197 --> 00:04:51,650
There wasn't so much crowd in 2019.

122
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,985
How many cars are there? Continuous?

123
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:57,148
So many people have come. Buses are full.

124
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,454
It feels like a politician's rally.

125
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,585
Oh dad, they closed the gate.

126
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,180
What a timing!

127
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:04,144
We will stuck here it too.

128
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:05,282
Hi! Hi! Hi!

129
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:07,332
It's 2.15 and launch is at 2.35.

130
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,241
But when the launch happens,

131
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:11,252
and after that, the ruckus,

132
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:15,255
and after that when Bharat Mata Ki Jai and Vande Mataram are shouted,  it makes the atmosphere.

133
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:16,158
 Tell me one thing,

134
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,636
 it stays in orbit for so many days,

135
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:20,084
- So from where he got his fuel?

136
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:22,139
The two big engines on the side are

137
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:23,688
solid fuel engines

138
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:25,441
and the one in the middle is the liquid stage.

139
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:29,073
In the start, for the first 2 minutes   the liquid stage and solid stage

140
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:31,949
burn together because at this time, the rocket is the heaviest.

141
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:35,493
It is a 640 ton rocket when it just lifts off and

142
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:38,852
to lift such a heavy rocket, a huge amount of power is required

143
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:43,991
To take any rocket into space, the minimum speed you have to achieve is

144
00:05:44,216 --> 00:05:46,169
 28000 km per hour i.e.

145
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:50,096
11.2 to 11.5 km per second

146
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,700
This is so fast that if your flight from Delhi to Chennai

147
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:53,997
getting to you in 2.5 hours

148
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:57,760
 Then this rocket will take you there in just 3.5 minutes.

149
00:05:58,037 --> 00:06:02,036
After that, you go to the cryogenic stage and the topmost

150
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:03,166
stage is the payload

151
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,513
Oh, his car is stuck.

152
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,010
Look at this,

153
00:06:06,372 --> 00:06:07,485
moon also has such soil.

154
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:11,645
If Ritu had come here in a pilot uniform, she will say I have to drive

155
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:12,833
Which school are you guys from?

156
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:15,561
They have come from Kolkata.

157
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,422
There's a crowd over there.

158
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,561
 Gate closed ? uh..

159
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:20,868
Oh God!

160
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:23,098
This guy is right, got out of here.

161
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,052
Dad, I am here. I won't be able to get out of here.

162
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,065
Should we try?

163
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:30,919
Hold the bag.

164
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:35,828
How do I get out of it?

165
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,853
Bro you got out of it.

166
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:38,841
I won't get out.

167
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:40,290
Oh Freind.

168
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:49,486
We got saved! I was getting stuck!

169
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:52,117
I was going this way and he was going that way.

170
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:52,709
Oh, people ran away!

171
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:53,786
The people ran away!

172
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,352
I'll have to run. Give me the bag.

173
00:06:56,377 --> 00:06:57,221
This guy is worried about the photo.

174
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:58,798
Let's run first! We'll get the photo later.

175
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,025
Run! Run! Run!

176
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:03,160
5 minutes to go! Let's go!

177
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:08,152
Only 5 minutes, 5 minutes only. Let's go, let's go.

178
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,786
Thank you sir, thank you.

179
00:07:11,405 --> 00:07:11,983
Let's go.

180
00:07:12,614 --> 00:07:13,982
It's newly build.

181
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:14,964
Look at this, This is our...

182
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,849
Come on kids, first you have to give the fitness test
and then you will be getting to watch Chandrayaan.

183
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:22,765
There's more up there?

184
00:07:23,164 --> 00:07:24,438
It's completely full up there.

185
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:31,066
Is it launched?

186
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,318
[ CHEERINGS ]

187
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,124
Ohh man.

188
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:44,070
It's so much crowd.

189
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:46,480
- Dad, there is the launch side.

190
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:48,086
The Launch side is over there.

191
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,302
There

192
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:54,642
- Yes, Yes this is the place where the four pillars are.

193
00:07:58,095 --> 00:07:58,595
Say, I

194
00:08:02,268 --> 00:08:03,570
ISRO..

195
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:05,566
Bharat Mata Ki

196
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:06,813
JAI..

197
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:18,659
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

198
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:54,120
Wow..

199
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:37,543
2 tons of fuel is being burnt in a second.

200
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:41,461
We are standing here from a long.

201
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:52,109
How was the experience?

202
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,884
- Nice.

203
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:54,281
Did you like the launch?

204
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:55,007
- Good

205
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:56,563
This is our rover,

206
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:58,502
This is the lander, it will do soft landing

207
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:00,277
Its mission is 14 Earth days

208
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:01,400
But it will be 1 day of Moon.

209
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:02,602
Do you work here?

210
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:03,794
- I have a question

211
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:06,312
If the moon comes out at night, then the rocket should also launch at night.

212
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:09,597
- No sir, it is depend on the orbital place

213
00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:14,944
We have to calculate according to the orbit we want to enter

214
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:18,912
Many of you may think that the rocket will take off from the earth

215
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:21,522
And will follow a straight line and go to the moon.

216
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,248
Because a straight line is a short distance isn't it?

217
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,240
Even I used to think so

218
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:26,444
But it doesn't happen

219
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:29,020
Do you remember when Chandrayaan 2 was launched?

220
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,228
We made a vlog on 22 July 2019

221
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:36,361
And its landing date was on the moon 2nd September 2019

222
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:38,122
That means it took 42 days

223
00:10:38,482 --> 00:10:40,418
To reach the moon from the earth.

224
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,957
Whereas Apollo 11

225
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:43,206
In which Neil Armstrong

226
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:45,382
The first man to land on the moon.

227
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,564
He reached the moon from the earth

228
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:49,214
In just 4 days

229
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:53,631
Why? Because ISRO does not send rockets directly from the earth to the moon

230
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:56,245
We send our satellites to the moon

231
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:58,645
In a very cost effective way

232
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,812
So, what does India's ISRO do?

233
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,498
It launches a rocket

234
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,358
And parks its satellite on the earth

235
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:06,908
In a parking orbit

236
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,380
We do a lot of tests there

237
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:10,897
And slowly turn on the engine

238
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,374
And increase the radius of that parking orbit.

239
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:16,560
This parking orbit is an elliptical orbit

240
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:18,878
Which passes through one corner of the earth

241
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:21,368
but passes to far past the other corner.

242
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,925
We use the gravitational force of the earth

243
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,252
To increase its speed.

244
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:27,690
Its elliptical orbit becomes so big

245
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:29,137
And it reaches far away from the earth.

246
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:31,857
Then we turn on its engine on final time

247
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:35,217
And send it near the gravitational force of the moon.

248
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:37,702
So, that it reaches the elliptical orbit of the moon.

249
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:40,974
And then we fire that engine in the reverse direction

250
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:43,722
And keep reducing the elliptical orbit.

251
00:11:43,914 --> 00:11:46,033
And one final time we do it.

252
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,076
So, he can land on the moon.

253
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:52,756
So, our rocket revolves around the earth for 29 days.

254
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:53,394
And then it

255
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:55,975
After that it revolves around the moon and then lands on the moon

256
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,770
That is why Chandrayaan 2 tooks 42 days to reach there.

257
00:11:58,864 --> 00:11:59,834
Dad is saying,

258
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:02,232
Chandrayaan left here his wheel, how he wii go.

259
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,397
What is the difference between you in 2019 and 2023?

260
00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:07,126
 Last time i think it was

261
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:08,430
so vibration,

262
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,670
that the whole earth was shaken,

263
00:12:11,345 --> 00:12:13,388
I mean, my stomach, my eyes, I felt it.

264
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:14,946
It was shaking like an earthquake.

265
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:17,414
This time it went up a lot, then I felt the vibration.

266
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:18,656
It wasn't that much?
- Not that much

267
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:21,524
Normal launches also you see or only?

268
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,037
Yes, PSLV also. You see PSLV also?

269
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:26,002
 2.35 was the launch, now it's 2.50.

270
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:27,808
I think it has gone out of earth.

271
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:30,413
Andhra Pradesh. A lot of people have come from Andhra Pradesh.

272
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,157
All the buses are from Andhra Pradesh.

273
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,880
What's the difference between Gen 2 and Gen 3, kids?

274
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:35,837
Who's going to tell me?

275
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:37,390
He has also a rocket Robert

276
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,312
What's in it? Who's Robert?

277
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,073
Robot. What's the name of the robot?

278
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:46,676
What is the name of the robot?

279
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:47,788
Chitti?

280
00:12:49,097 --> 00:12:49,870
HaHaHa..
