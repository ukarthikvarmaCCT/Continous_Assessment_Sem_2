22
00:04:59,642 --> 00:05:01,426
It's his Ferrari,

There is a reason why I'm visiting
this aquarium in Atlantis today.

50
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:24,523
I can relate to these fishes because
these fishes live in a tank,

51
00:08:24,523 --> 00:08:26,386
and us youtubers live in a bubble.

52
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:38,445
So today, we're going to desert safari to
celebrate MythPat's 1 million subscribers.

00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:20,787
when there are 3 overrated youtubers and
1 underrated youtuber in one car?

60

70
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,740
take a time lapse.

71
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:49,429
- Let's do it, brother.
What do you do for a living?

76
00:10:57,237 --> 00:11:00,882
Did you know the guy from India?
I think his name is AJ.

77
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:02,182
By the way, my name is AJ.

78
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:03,829
- AJ?
- AJ, yeah.

79
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:08,133
- What do you think about him, brother?
Like...I've watched a lot of his videos.

80
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,757
Is that really real, my brother, like, 
whatever he does? Like whatever he's doing?

81
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:16,746
- [sigh] Yes, whatever he does
is 100% real, you know...

82
00:11:16,746 --> 00:11:20,226
- Alright.
- ...it's a very authentic prank, what he does.

83
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:23,231
- Alright.
- He pranks his audience, not the girls,  you know?

84
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:26,080
- He calls the girls like "madam".
What madam, you know?

85
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,983
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.

86
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:30,000
- Like, whatever he did.
- Yeah.

87
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,388

90
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:40,941
- We're fucking dickhead, but in reality
we're not fucking dickhead, my bro, you know?

91
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:44,590
He can think about himself. He's crazy
or he dickhead, or he's whatever, you know?

92
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,258
