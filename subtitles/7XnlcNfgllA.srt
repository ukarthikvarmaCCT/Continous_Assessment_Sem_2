00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
[guitar music]
- Welcome

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,435
to Sidemen vs. Mr. Beast.

3
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:04,647
[contestants clapping and cheering]

4
00:00:04,647 --> 00:00:05,852
- Woo! Yes!

5
00:00:05,852 --> 00:00:07,482
- Team Mr. Beast is going first.

6
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:08,824
Who is going to do the challenge?

7
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:10,191
- I'll do it. I don't know.

8
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:12,687
[contestants clapping and cheering]

9
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:15,247
- The first round is
called Honeycomb Maze.

10
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:16,601
- You must find the exit to the maze

11
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,106
without getting stopped by the bees.

12
00:00:18,106 --> 00:00:19,662
- And the team with the fastest total time

13
00:00:19,662 --> 00:00:20,495
wins.

14
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:22,212
Once you walk in, I'm
gonna start the timer.

15
00:00:22,212 --> 00:00:23,045
- Oh, God.
- Are you ready?

16
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:24,805
- Goofy Goobers, you good?

17
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:26,051
- We're ready.
- Yeah!

18
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:26,884
[contestant laughing]

19
00:00:26,884 --> 00:00:27,717
- Look at this bee.

20
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:28,550
- 3. 2. 1.

21
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:30,748
Let's go!
[horn blowing]

22
00:00:30,748 --> 00:00:31,581
- Good luck, Jimmy.

23
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:33,164
- Go! He's going! Go!

24
00:00:33,164 --> 00:00:34,804
Go right, go right! Keep going!

25
00:00:34,804 --> 00:00:35,669
- Why's the bee not moving?

26
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:36,710
- Go right!
- He's actually elite.

27
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,668
[indistinct]

28
00:00:37,668 --> 00:00:38,530
This man is moving quick.

29
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,953
- What are the bees doing?

30
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:40,786
- Boom!

31
00:00:40,786 --> 00:00:42,294
[indistinct yelling]

32
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:44,152
[contestants clapping and cheering]

33
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:45,276
- You know what? This is too easy.

34
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:46,109
[confetti popping]

35
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:47,191
Let's go.

36
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:48,898
- 8.5 seconds.
- Yes!

37
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:49,731
- I mean, he's done it.

38
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:50,564
He's done it. He's done it.

39
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:53,333
We've got an eight minute
Sidemen Sunday boys.

40
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,446
- Oh, you silly, silly boys.

41
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:56,778
You thought you could get rid of me?

42
00:00:56,778 --> 00:00:58,145
Well, guess what? Never!

43
00:00:58,145 --> 00:00:59,775
It's Ethan, and I'm here to tell you

44
00:00:59,775 --> 00:01:01,469
to hit that subscribe button.

45
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,564
We are not at 17 million subscribers yet.

46
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,906
What are you doing?

47
00:01:04,906 --> 00:01:05,889
Click the red button!

48
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:06,722
[fire exploding]

49
00:01:06,722 --> 00:01:07,555
- So is Sidemen team going now?

50
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:08,388
- Yeah.

51
00:01:08,388 --> 00:01:09,221
- All right. Who's going?

52
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:11,080
[indistinct chattering]
- Yeah, I'll go. I'll go.

53
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,956
- You gotta beat that. 8 seconds.

54
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:14,141
- Oh my gosh.

55
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,035
- How am I even gonna beat that?

56
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:16,393
- Were there even bees in there?

57
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:18,248
- Bro, yes and you just
dodged all of them.

58
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:19,081
[Jimmy laughing]

59
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:20,276
- If JJ finishes it, he'll be lucky.

60
00:01:20,276 --> 00:01:22,449
- I think JJ's best option is just brute.

61
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,931
- He's going to fight a bee.

62
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:25,333
- Just literally just run.

63
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,258
- JJ, are you ready?

64
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:27,091
- Yeah.

65
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:28,551
- You've got a very tough time to beat.

66
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:29,551
3, 2, 1, go.

67
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:33,640
[horn blowing]
- Go on, JJ!

68
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,786
- He's off. He's off. He's off.

69
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:36,619
- He already ran into one.

70
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:38,045
- Oh.

71
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:39,549
[contestants laughing and cheering]

72
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:40,382
- [Simon Run, JJ, run!

73
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:42,100
- Sounds like he's
smashing every damn door.

74
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,444
[contestants laughing]

75
00:01:43,444 --> 00:01:44,774
- Bro, the door sound effect.

76
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:46,894
[contestants laughing]

77
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:49,310
[contestants screaming and laughing]

78
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,143
- He just pushed the bee.

79
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:50,976
- He just shoved the bee.

80
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:51,870
- f*ckin-

81
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,997
Fam!

82
00:01:52,997 --> 00:01:55,881
- Someone tell him the
bee's not Logan Paul.

83
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:57,394
- It seems like he's hit every door

84
00:01:57,394 --> 00:01:58,810
but the right one.
- Get off me!

85
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,393
No. Ah! Get off me!

86
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:04,444
- He may actually die in this maze.

87
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:07,679
Is there food and water in
there? Because he might run out.

88
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:08,637
- Oh my God.

89
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:09,603
[bee buzzing]

90
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:12,268
- It's right there. It's right there.

91
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:13,530
- Oh God! No!

92
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,363
- No it wasn't.

93
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:15,196
Bro.
[indistinct]

94
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:18,391
- He's tried every door at this point.

95
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:19,233
- We're coming up on the clock.

96
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:21,102
- He thinks he's tried every door.

97
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:22,071
- Oh my God.

98
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:24,298
- Wait, wait, wait, he
just kicked the door open.

99
00:02:24,298 --> 00:02:26,540
- That wasn't the right door,
but I still stopped the timer.

100
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,656
- Go back in!
- That's not the exit.

101
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:29,173
- Go back in.
- Go back in.

102
00:02:29,173 --> 00:02:30,604
- I mean, I technically stopped the timer.

103
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:32,001
They don't have to know that.

104
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:32,834
And, okay.

105
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:33,731
He's broken another door.
- No!

106
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:34,564
- No, go through that one. It's this one.

107
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:36,663
- Stop breaking the doors!

108
00:02:36,663 --> 00:02:37,989
- Now he knows where it is.

109
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:39,448
- You're almost there.
You've almost got it.

110
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:40,281
There we go.

111
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:41,147
[contestants clapping]

112
00:02:41,147 --> 00:02:41,980
- Nice.

113
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,878
- We'll give him a participation trophy.

114
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:44,711
- A minute sixteen.

115
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:45,544
- Oh wow. Okay.

116
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:47,152
- No confetti for you. I'm sorry.

117
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:47,985
- Oh...

118
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:49,860
- We should subtract 10 seconds
for kicking down a door.

119
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,693
That was funny.

120
00:02:50,693 --> 00:02:53,264
- Yeah, that's alright.
Let's give him 56 seconds.

121
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:55,258
- Ah, nice.
[contestants clapping]

122
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,327
- Team Sidemen,

123
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:57,807
Who do you want to compete next?

124
00:02:57,807 --> 00:02:58,691
- We need someone smart.

125
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:00,230
- We need our equivalent.

126
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,063
Nimble.

127
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:02,233
- Oh, Nimble. Nimble.

128
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,066
- Yeah, Vik.

129
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,174
- All right, let's go.
- Go on, Vik.

130
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:05,565
[clapping]
- Go on, Vik!

131
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:06,398
- I'm gonna go sneaky, stealth mode.

132
00:03:06,398 --> 00:03:09,318
- Um, I wouldn't, I would go very fast.

133
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:10,151
3, 2, 1.

134
00:03:11,618 --> 00:03:12,451
Go in.

135
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:13,541
[horn blowing]

136
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,534
- Here we go, go on!

137
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:15,367
Go on, Vik.

138
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:16,432
You're going the wrong way.

139
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:18,031
- Okay. How's Vikkstar doing?

140
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,195
He's the smartest of the Sidemen.

141
00:03:19,195 --> 00:03:20,528
I'm worried for him.

142
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:21,883
He's already passed Jimmy's time.

143
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:22,948
Pressure is gonna be mounting.

144
00:03:22,948 --> 00:03:24,379
It's not looking good for the Sidemen.

145
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:25,360
- Maybe this is smart.

146
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,193
- Where's the finish line?

147
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:27,685
- No, the bees don't know where he is.

148
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:28,858
- There's a bee there. On the right!

149
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:31,019
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no
that bee has seen him.

150
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,985
[door hitting wall]
[Vik screaming]

151
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:34,651
[contestants yelling]

152
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:35,484
- Run Vik.

153
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:36,317
- Get off me.

154
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,150
- He might be starting to panic.

155
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,983
[Josh chuckling]
- Get off me!

156
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:39,684
- He might be getting claustrophobic.

157
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:40,517
Go back in-

158
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:41,350
[Vik yelling]

159
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,894
[laughing] He came out the entrance.

160
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:44,891
- Well that bee is on him.

161
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,229
- He's moving so fast though.

162
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:49,137
- He's getting gang banged by two bees.

163
00:03:49,137 --> 00:03:50,983
[Vik yelling]

164
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:53,941
- Yes!
[contestants cheering]

165
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:55,437
- So Vik, so come on here.
- Well done, Vik.

166
00:03:55,437 --> 00:03:56,942
- It wasn't awful. It wasn't awful.

167
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:58,608
- It just wasn't great.
- It wasn't awful.

168
00:03:58,608 --> 00:04:00,475
- Vikkstar did it in exactly one minute.

169
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:02,062
[contestants slightly clapping]

170
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:04,527
- One minute forty-eight
seconds versus eight seconds.

171
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:07,118
Chris, you can't possibly screw this up.

172
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:08,379
- Don't say that.

173
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,755
- Literally, even if
you tried, you couldn't.

174
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:12,912
- I believe in you. Come
on, look at the ground.

175
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:13,940
- Now that I've seen other people do it,

176
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,517
how did it take you eight seconds?

177
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:17,498
- All right, Chris, are you ready?

178
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:18,563
- I'm ready, Freddy.

179
00:04:18,563 --> 00:04:20,804
- You've only got to beat one
minute forty eight seconds.

180
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:22,328

00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:24,378
avoid the three solid wooden doors

223
00:05:24,378 --> 00:05:25,678

[contestants laughing]

251
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:04,780

- He pushed him through, but he won.

00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:07,012
[contestant laughing]

254
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:08,487
- Is Chris alright?

255
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:09,928
[contestants laughing and clapping]

256
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:10,761
- I was just in war.

257
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,591
- I put my arm through a wall.

258
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:13,839
- I just pushed you through that one.

259
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,701
- I know it's fine.

260
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:17,348
As I dove through, I hit my knee

261
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:19,522
and I was just like, I'm still
winning it doesn't matter.

262

[contestants laughing]

263
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:21,229

00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:22,285
[contestants laughing]

265
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:23,821
- Like, what the hell?

266
00:06:23,821 --> 00:06:26,253
- Nolan, don't mess up or
you're off the channel.

267
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,710
- 3.
- Hold them back.

268
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,201

[indistinct yelling]

275
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:39,247

00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:40,080
Yes!

277
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,155
- Right here, Tareq!

278
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:42,676
Push them out of the way.

[indistinct yelling]

280
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:45,759

281
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,670
Hold him.

[contestants yelling]

283
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:48,892

- What the f*ck.

288
00:06:53,765 --> 00:06:54,683
- Ooooooh.

289
00:06:54,683 --> 00:06:55,516
[contestants laughing]

290
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,349
- Nolan got three in a row.

291
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,414
- He's a beast!
- Come here Nolan.

292
00:06:57,414 --> 00:06:58,247
- You can't beat me.

293
00:06:58,247 --> 00:06:59,446
I'm a Fall Guys champion!

294
00:06:59,446 --> 00:07:01,370
- Well, the Sidemen f*ckin' suck.

295
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,095
- Bro, he just went
through every right door.

296
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:04,975
- Bro, he got four doors in a row.

297
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:06,937
I didn't even get to a door
before he got through it.

298
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:08,731
- You are being embarrassed
on your own channel.

299
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:10,736
- Our strategy was, I was
like, yo, you spearhead,

300
00:07:10,736 --> 00:07:12,365
I'll just let you know
if you messed up or not.

301
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,488
- I didn't mess up though.
- He didn't mess up.

302
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:15,035
He didn't mess up.
- How?!

303
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,015
- You just gonna leave me hanging.

304
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:16,848
- Oh, that was embarrassing.

305
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:18,514
- Hey, buddy.
[contestant laughing]

306
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:20,059
- They spent half a million
dollars on this video

307
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:21,667
just for us to come in here and [laughs].

308
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,194
- Sweep the floor.

309
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:24,709
- Like how did you, when you
looked at this, for example?

310
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:27,429
- To me it just looks slightly different.

311
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:29,102
- Wait, so Nolan came in first?

312
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:29,935
- Yes.

313
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:30,768
- Who came in second?

314
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:31,601
- That's what I was asking.

315
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:33,170
I was so focused on Nolan.

316
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,378
- I'm gonna say it.

317
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:35,963
Not even a competition.

318
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:36,978
- Come on.
- I knew it was coming.

319
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:37,820
[contestants clapping]

320
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,653
- Come on.

321
00:07:38,653 --> 00:07:40,679
- There's nothing we can
do there. There's nothing.

322
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:41,628
- Surprise, surprise.

323

[contestants clapping]

326
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,803
- That was a microphone
that I was fist bumping.

327
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:47,636
- We win!

328
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:48,469
- Yeah!

329
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,302
- I see it, I hit it, you know?

330
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,181
- We win those.

331
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,014
- I'm actually embarrassed.

332
00:07:51,014 --> 00:07:51,847
- Yeah, I'm ashamed.

333
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,306

all right. We go again.

must race through the

337
00:07:58,514 --> 00:07:59,987
and take on the obstacle.

338
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:01,467
- And the first team to
complete a whole lap,

339
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:02,483
wins.
[timer counting down]

340
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,316
- Yo, here we go. Here we go.

341
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,149

- Go!

345
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:11,870

[contestants laughing]

347
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:13,545

[laughing]

352
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:18,207
- Dude, he got caught by the banana!

353
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,517
- Look. It slowed him down for one second.

354
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:21,532
[contestant yelling]

355
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:22,589

- Wait. Oh man.

358
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,352
- There's no way Nolan's getting up that-

359
00:08:25,352 --> 00:08:26,185
- Nolan, block him-

360
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:27,018
- I can't get up the hill!

361
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:27,851

363
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:29,682

364
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:30,515

365
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,249

- Oh, the Chandler banana again.

370
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,693
- I've broken my bike.

371
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:38,611
- Chandler's gonna have time to catch up

372
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:40,477
by the time they go over the ramp, bro.

373
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:42,343
[contestants laughing]

374
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:43,888

375
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:44,721
[contestants laughing]

376
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:45,736
- He's not touching
his feet to the ground.

377
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:47,319
- I'll go, I'll help.

378
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,604
- How do we get up?

379
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:49,437
- Wait.

380
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:50,481
- Josh is coming.

381
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:51,559
- Should we go help?

382
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,423
- One person go.

383
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:53,256

384
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:54,449

385
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:55,314

[contestants laughing]

387
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:57,819
- I've got nothin'. I can't go, I can't-

388
00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:58,972
- The bike broke.

389
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,977
[contestants yelling]
- No, I was so close!

390
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:02,333
- Dude, this is like a fight right now.

391
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,916
- Come here, Josh.
- Oh my God.

392
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:04,788
Just chaos.

393
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:08,042
- We put together an expensive
set for this to happen.

394
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,534
[contestant giggling]

395
00:09:09,534 --> 00:09:11,519
- Literally for them to get
stuck in the first third.

396
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,352
- Oh no.
- Yes!

397

400
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:17,341
- Oh, Nolan's gonna fall off the bridge.

401
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:18,248
- Wait, the bridge is smoking!

402
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:20,276
- I can't do anything and I've
got no handle bars anymore.

403
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:21,898
- Wait, why is it literally
about to catch fire?

404
00:09:21,898 --> 00:09:22,824
- Josh help.

405
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:23,657

409
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,217
Catch up!

410
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:31,601

[Simon screaming]

415
00:09:35,752 --> 00:09:37,084
- This is much harder than it looks.

416
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:38,611
- Oh, what? Who's falling off and-

417
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,871
- Nolan's actually doing the best.

418
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,704
How is this possible?
- Simon go.

419
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,412
[contestant laughing and panting]

420
00:09:42,412 --> 00:09:44,294
- What just got thrown?

421
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:45,649
- Nolan, keep going.

422
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:47,046
- I'm so tired.

423
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:49,243
- You're the only one
still doing anything.

424
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:51,814
- Push me up. My middle name is speed.

425
00:09:51,814 --> 00:09:53,031
Ah, my balls.

426
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:54,032

Cross the finish line.

[contestant grunting]

439
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:11,975

- Harry, what the f*ck?

444
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,993
- What happened to your bike?

445
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:20,874
- Harry, take this.

446
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:21,707
- There's just one left.

447
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:22,540
- Take my bike.

448
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,373
- To where?

449
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,511
- To go back through.
- I hope it's one lap.

450
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:25,852
- Wait, is Chandler gonna make it?

451
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:27,358
- I'll push you up.

452
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:28,191
- You got this Chandler.

453
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:29,460

- Help me.

457
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:34,399

lean back a little bit.

- Chandler, you got it.
[contestant laughing]

459
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:36,898
- You've got to lean back a little bit.

460
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:37,856

461
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:39,376

That was the slowest photo
finish I've seen in my life.

[contestants laughing]

508
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,065

509
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:34,968
and do one more round.

510
00:11:34,968 --> 00:11:35,801
- All the way.

511
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:36,634

- We need someone,

515
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,009
we need someone lightweight
on the next one.

516
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,746
- The people that assembled
this forgot the screws.

517
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,839
All right, it's only been two seconds

518
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,078
since the last race.

519
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:50,083
Switched to bigger cars, cause
the other ones fell apart.

520
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:50,916

- Is that Karl?

528
00:11:58,539 --> 00:11:59,372
Wait, he went off the track.

529
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:00,385

Go! We practised this.

- Drift it.

537
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:12,012
No, Josh. Come on.

538
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:12,973
- He's not helping him get up.

539
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:14,005
- Oh no!

540
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:15,394
- They're coming all the way around.

541
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:16,491

What is he doing?

That's gotta be illegal.

Look at the handle.

him back. Pull him back.

633
00:14:08,246 --> 00:14:09,711

Yeah sabotage your own teammate.

675
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:10,250
- You have to catch the ball

676
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,503
and score a touchdown
[men cheering in background]

00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:23,240
- Hey, when you hit a
touchdown, hit that griddy.

683
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,571
- I would pay to see Karl hit the griddy.

684
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:27,426

We're going no hands.

how confident we are.

He was out of bounds.

703
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,199
- No shot. No shot.

704
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,032

- Oh, let's go.

707
00:15:55,814 --> 00:15:57,241

708
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:59,149
'cause he definitely
stepped out like four times.

709
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:00,630
- Yo, that turtle's stuck.

710
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,458
Everybody make fun of that turtle.

[contestants chanting]

720
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:13,209

They ain't gonna stop him realistically.

724
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:17,966
- How long do you guys think

725
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:19,181
it's gonna take KSI to do this?

726
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:20,837
I think maybe five seconds.

727
00:16:20,837 --> 00:16:21,670
- JJ remember you can't,

728
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,365
we actually have to win this one, man.

729
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:24,781
- Guys, can you start from the 20?

730
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:26,938
- Hey, they want us to
start from the 20 yard line.

731
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:28,505
- Hey, how 'bout you suck my nut sack?

732
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:29,421
- Come on, JJ.

733
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,319
- Let's go, JJ.

734
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:31,152
[horn blowing]

735
00:16:31,152 --> 00:16:31,985
- Oh, god.
- He's off.

736
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:32,818
- Oh.

737
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:33,651
Oooh!

738
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:34,484
- He's overdoing it. He's overdoing it.

739
00:16:34,484 --> 00:16:35,550
He's overdoing it.

740
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,420
- Get him!
- He's overdoing it!

741
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,652
- No!

742
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:40,777
[contestants laughing]

743
00:16:40,777 --> 00:16:43,679
[contestants cheering]

744
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,884
- Yes!

745
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:45,821
What!

746
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:47,551
[grunting and yelling]

747
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:48,881
[contestants laughing]

748
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:49,792
[grunting]

749
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:50,625
- Alright.

750
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,458
- What do I do?

751
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,291
- Don't f*cking lose.

752
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,091
[contestants laughing]

753
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:55,710
- Okay guys, do me a favour.

754
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,906
Crunch this mutha f*cka.

755
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:58,878
- Dude, Nolan's gonna get destroyed.

756
00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:00,746
- Look at him. He just looks terrified.

757
00:17:00,746 --> 00:17:02,624
- Josh is really strategizing, by the way.

758
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:03,753
- Well, they got a formation.

759
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:05,524
- We have a very obvious weak side.

760
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,357
I'm just saying

761
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:08,604
when you have Josh, JJ, and
Harry in a line like that,

762
00:17:08,604 --> 00:17:11,381
and then you have Tobi, Vik,
and you can just run at them.

763
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:13,183
- What's wrong with Tobi and Vik?

764
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:14,420
- They're just very petite.

765
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,042
- What do you mean by that?

766
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:17,566
- Small, pequeno.

767
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:18,718
- Hey, what's wrong with petite?

768
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:19,551
- Yeah!

769
00:17:21,054 --> 00:17:22,174
- Don't let him through, boys.

770
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,435
Do not let him through.

771
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:24,297
[contestant yelling]

772
00:17:24,297 --> 00:17:25,203
- Come on, lads!

773
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:28,037
[chanting]
Come on, lads!

774
00:17:28,037 --> 00:17:29,812
- Do this buddy. [clapping]
- Wow, they're intimidating.

775
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:30,645
[horn blowing]

776
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:31,478
- All right.

777
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:33,585
[indistinct yelling]

778
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,968
- What is that run? Oh, no.

779
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:36,801
- Hold him back-
- Oh!

780
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:37,758
- Hold him, hold him.
[clapping and yelling]

781
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:38,591
[indistinct yelling]

782
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,424
- Oh, the Josh.

783
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:40,257
- Josh has got him.

784
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:41,090
[contestants laughing]

785
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,898
- You're not done. Get back in there, son.

786
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:43,731
- He's not done.

787
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,564
- He's still going.

788
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,503
- Keep going.

789
00:17:45,503 --> 00:17:46,566
- Go Josh.
- Go!

790
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,816
[contestants laughing]

791
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:53,328
- Josh really tried.

792
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:54,651
- Nolan just got man handled.

793
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:55,867
- I don't think I got 10 feet.

794
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,275
[contestants laughing]

795
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:58,108
- Two.

796
00:17:58,108 --> 00:17:58,941
- Got a win.

797
00:17:58,941 --> 00:17:59,937
- I want Harry to get one on his ass.

798
00:17:59,937 --> 00:18:01,327
Like I want him to push someone over.

799
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:02,288
- He doesn't even have pads on.

800
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:03,632
- Harry, are you ready?

801
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:04,465
- Come on, Beast.

802
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:05,572
- Come on, Harry.
- Let's go, Harry.

803
00:18:05,572 --> 00:18:06,405
- Let's go, Harry.

804
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:07,878
- Let's go, Harry, let's go.

805
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,305
[horn blowing]
- Go on now!

806
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,374
- Oh no.
- He's fumbled.

807
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:12,495
- Oh no.

808
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:13,445
- Go, go, go.

809
00:18:13,445 --> 00:18:15,612
- Oh no he's down.
- Oh no.

810
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,328
- Coach.

811
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:18,161
- Thanks for giving me the opportunity.

812
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:20,441
- Hey, I want to tell
you, boy, you can do it.

813
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:21,467
You're gonna go all the way to state.

814
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,270
- I ain't gonna say
much, but I am gonna say,

815
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,299
you either run or you're dead.

816
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:27,748
[Tobi yelling]
[horn blowing]

817
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:29,623
- Here we go, lads.

818
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:31,107
- Oh no.
- Nice. Nice.

819
00:18:31,107 --> 00:18:32,482
- Oh.
- Well, in the flip flop-

820
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:33,315
- You just gotta hold it.

821
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:34,148
You just gotta hold it-

822
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:35,214
- He's wearing flip flops.

823
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,208
[contestants laughing]
- Keep him there, man.

824
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,450
- They got speed, bro.

825
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,283
- Nice.

826
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:40,336
- Oh.

827
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,406
- Oh. Take him down boys.
[indistinct yelling]

828
00:18:42,406 --> 00:18:43,749
- You either run or you're dead.

829
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:44,902
- Run, Chan, run.

830
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:45,808
[contestants cheering]

831
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:46,725
- Get back up, get back up.

832
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,558
[contestants cheering]

833
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:48,391
- Oh, he's wearing flip flops.

834
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:49,456
Why don't we take that into consideration?

835
00:18:49,456 --> 00:18:50,360
- Let's go, boys.

836
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,693
[contestants cheering and laughing]

837
00:18:56,745 --> 00:18:57,820
- Yeah!

838
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,915
- Hey, he was in flip flops.

839
00:18:58,915 --> 00:19:00,654
In hindsight, not the best strategy.

840
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:01,562
- Come on, Tobi.

841
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:03,228
- Let's go, Tobi.
- Let's go.

842
00:19:03,228 --> 00:19:04,331
- Tobi!
- Let's go.

843
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:05,164
[contestants clapping and cheering]

844
00:19:05,164 --> 00:19:05,997
- His movement.

845
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:06,830
Watch.

846
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,663
- His movement's crazy.

847
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:08,748
- Yo, he's about to be here
without even realising it-

848
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:09,581
- He's gonna slide cancel.

849
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,530
- How many seconds you give him?

850
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,405
- I think he might do it in
like six seconds, you know.

851
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:13,238
- Really?

852
00:19:13,238 --> 00:19:14,071
- Come on, Tobi.

853
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:14,904
- Come on, Jizzle.

854
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:15,737
- Let's go!

855
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,570
[clapping]
- Tobi.

856
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,403
- Give 'em the jizz.

857
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:18,370
- Tobi. Tobi. Tobi-

858
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,722
[horn blowing]
Tobi. Tobi. Tobi.

859
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:20,567
[yelling]

860
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:21,400
- Come on, Beast.

861
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,474
- Oh, there's a gap here.

862
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:23,542
- Oh!

863
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:24,446
- Watch out for the wall.

864
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:25,919
- Oh!
- Tobi!

865
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,285
[contestants clapping and yelling]

866
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:31,118
- Yeah!

867
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:31,951
What, what!

868
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:33,431
[contestants grunting]

869
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:34,570
- And the winner of that challenge,

870
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,852
finally on the scoreboard...

871
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:37,119
- Yes.
- Yes!

872
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,508
- After so many challenges.

873
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:39,341
[contestants laughing]

874
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:40,322
- We felt, we felt bad.

875
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:41,155
- Yeah.

876
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:41,988
- Team Sidemen.

877
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:43,447
- Yeah!

878
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:44,960
- We had to give 'em one.
- Woo!

879
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,112
- I'm keeping the jersey.

880
00:19:46,112 --> 00:19:47,915
- Hey. Football is their thing.

881
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:49,505
If we beat them it
would've been embarrassing.

882
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:50,338
- I was gonna say,

883
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:51,926
the American sport is when
you finally showed up.

884
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:52,759
[contestants laughing]

885
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,592
What are you doing?

886
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,505
- Let's do baseball or basketball.

887
00:19:54,505 --> 00:19:56,021
- Oh no, no, no.
- Please no. Please no.

888
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:57,588
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

889
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:59,005
- With the score already being 3-1

890
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:01,260
to Mr. Beast's team, we
have to raise the stakes.

891
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,039
For this last round, whichever team wins,

892
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,372
wins the whole video.

893
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:05,952
- The first person to
stop in the right place,

894
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:08,321
exactly above the arrow,
wins for their team.

895
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:09,154
- If you don't go far enough,

896
00:20:09,154 --> 00:20:10,282
or you go too far,

897
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:12,019
you get dunked in the pool.

898
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:14,602
[upbeat music]

899
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:18,315
- I'm gonna show you boys
how this challenge is done.

900
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:19,415
- Go on, son.

901
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:20,982
- He's got the surfer in him.

902
00:20:20,982 --> 00:20:23,074
- Oh, whoa.
- Oh no.

903
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:24,918
[contestants yelling]

- I'd recommend going slower.

910
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:32,363

how freezing are you?

911
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:34,217

945
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:24,492

America to here just for this.

946
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,452
- Jimmy, how many centimetres

947
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,768
in between the start and the end?

948

and instead of coming
up, you just went down.

1013

00:24:56,776 --> 00:24:58,173
I hate all of you.

1085
00:24:58,173 --> 00:24:59,516
- I don't wanna be pushed
in by the other team.

1086
00:24:59,516 --> 00:25:00,647
- I just like torturing the boys.

1087
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:01,480
- This is horrible.

1088
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,153
- Here, help me push him over.

1089
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:04,317
[contestant screaming]

1090
00:25:04,317 --> 00:25:05,446
- This is why it's my job, Jimmy.

1091
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:06,523
[buzzer sounding]
[Simon groaning]

1092
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:07,356
[contestants clapping]

1093
00:25:07,356 --> 00:25:08,529
- I don't wanna do this.

1094
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:09,469
- I give that a 10.

1095
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:11,080
- Someone's gotta do this, man.

1096
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,571
- Alright, let's do this.

1097
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:14,181
- All right, Tareq. Let's see it.

1098
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,696
[board sliding]
- He's off.

1099
00:25:15,696 --> 00:25:17,126
[indistinct chattering]

1100
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:18,513
- I think he's done it.

1101
00:25:18,513 --> 00:25:19,486
- I think he did!

1102
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:22,951
[contestants screaming and clapping]

1103
00:25:22,951 --> 00:25:24,484
- Let's freaking go!

1104
00:25:24,484 --> 00:25:25,703
- Did we do it?

1105
00:25:25,703 --> 00:25:26,536
- I love you!

1106
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:27,369
- Even though we won,

1107
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:28,581
I think we should still push Tareq in.

1108
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:29,948
Come on, come one, come on.

1109
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:31,100
[contestants laughing]

1110
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,433
- Thumbnail this.

1111
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:33,266
- All right.

1112
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:36,030
- Wait, wait, don't hold this.
That your sh*t thumbnail.

1113
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,898
[water splashing]
[contestants laughing]
