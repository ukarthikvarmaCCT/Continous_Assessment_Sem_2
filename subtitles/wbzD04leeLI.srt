1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,150
- So, I saw this video in my suggested.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,710
It was about Ultra-Ever Dry

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,110
which is apparently as
good at repelling water

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,430
as I am women.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,950
Look at how water just runs off this paper

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,970
and how this tissue,

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,310
which I remind you should
be absorbing the water,

8
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,930
is instead playing God.

9
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,450
Instantly a million
questions flood in my mind.

10
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,470
Like what happens if you put this

11
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,030
on a boat and put the boat in water?

12
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,040
Or, can I put this on my
feet and walk on water?

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,350
These were just things I needed to know.

14
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,780
So, I went to Amazon and
I bought a couple gallons

15
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,910
of this stuff and this was the result.

16
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,830
So, like any logical person,

17
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,650
the first question I needed answered was

18
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,510
if I spray this stuff on my underwear

19
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,273
can I just pee in them all
the time and it stay dry?

20
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,781
Chris, some of my pee's
still on the underwear.

21
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:47,460
- You've got some pretty thick pee.

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,293
- What do we do?

23
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:49,353
Hey, it never happened.

24
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,710
Yeah, I don't think we sprayed both sides.

25
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:54,840
- Look at that.

26
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,760
- Next, I wanted to test a clip

27
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,413
EverDry had in their video.

28
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,440
- This shirt is covered in EverDry.

29
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,023
This designer Supreme shirt isn't.

30
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:12,010
- Ugh.

31
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,423
Thanks.

32
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:15,990
- Wait, no, they only did
the front of his shirt.

33
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,823
Not the back.

34
00:01:16,823 --> 00:01:18,360
I'm super disgusting.

35
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,193
Come up here.

36
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,420
- I have grass in me.

37
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,830
Why do I have grass in me?

38
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,000
You can see a clear difference.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,870
This is the front.

40
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,940
So, it's got the water drops
on, but they'll come off.

41
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,290
And then this is the back.

42
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,700
Look at my tie though.

43
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,260
My tie's spot on, here.

44
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,490
We'll just dunk the whole tie.

45
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,890
That actually is pretty cool

46
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,950
- Splash back 'cause I
think my mouth was open.

47
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,323
Paper towel covered
iEverDry versus ketchup.

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,850
It's not working like it did in the video.

49
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,310
I don't know what demonic
crap they're doing,

50
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,350
but my ever drive must be broke.

51
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,390
Now, if you guys have ever
used a paper towel before,

52
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,470
now, if you guys have ever
used to pay for towel before,

53
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,270
not quite sure why I thought some

54
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,490
of you have never used
a paper towel before.

55
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,190
Of course, they've fucking
used a paper towel before.

56
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,660
You know it absorbs water.

57
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,680
Look at this.

58
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,930
It's not absorbing water.

59
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,700
You can throw it.

60
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,923
This is a roll of paper towels.

61
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,240
Wow, it's actually not really that wet.

62
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,030
Waterproofing my underwear
worked so well that when I pee

63
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,190
in the middle of the night,
it just runs up my bedsheets.

64
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,253
So, of course, now we have
to waterproof my bedsheets.

65
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,650
In this clip, we covered
a cotton ball and EverDry

66
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,963
and I think Chris summed it up perfectly.

67
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,470
- That one's pretty cool.

68
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,750
- We then took a bagel, which oddly enough

69
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,760
looks like a butthole and waterproofed it.

70
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,593
- I feel like a bagel

71
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:53,429
would be kind of waterproof anyway.

72
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:55,320
- Yeah.

73
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,330
Afterwards we waterproof a wallet

74
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,030
and I just realized leather is waterproof,

75
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,770
so that was unnecessary.

76
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,390
Chris, you're fired.

77
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,700
I wanna dump this cinder
block in this water,

78
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,933
but it's really heavy.

79
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,703
- You rang?

80
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:11,880
- Yeah, that was my viking call.

81
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,800
Hey, can you dip this in
the water tank for me?

82
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,127
It's like, it's really heavy,
but you're like a big boy.

83
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,115
Ah!

84
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:21,063
Now we lift it out.

85
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,140
And look, that's the part with EverDry.

86
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,666
That's the part without it.

87
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,440
- Hm.
- All right, Mr. Viking,

88
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,273
you can go.

89
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:30,150
- Okay.
- Remember guys,

90
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,208
if you ever need a Viking, just go...

91
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,570
Then we waterproofed my
merch because apparently

92
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,630
I haven't plugged it in the
last five videos and yeah,

93
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,180
not plugging your merch equals no sales.

94
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,013
Yeah, that's been pretty rough.

95
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,560
- Did you miss?

96
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,810
- Hey, it worked.

97
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,250
- That's where the
EverDry is and look at it

98
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,860
just running down and
not sticking like it is.

99
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,009
Holy crap, the EverDry
comes all the way back here.

100
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:09,825
- Yeah.

101
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:11,592
- Jake, you got it on as Yeezys.

102
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:12,930
- No, did I really?
- Yeah.

103
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,210
- This is like the fifth time
you've hit me with an egg.

104
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,557
- Keep going, oh my God.

105
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:18,390
- Oh.

106
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,840
- I don't think the EverDry's working

107
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,740
on the side of the van.

108
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,023
- Here, let me try.

109
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,340
I missed.

110
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,950
- The EverDry's over there.
- Oh, it's where?

111
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,100
- It's in the back of the van.
- Oh, okay.

112
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,900
Ah, crap, I missed again.

113
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,663
- See right there?
- Oh.

114
00:04:35,663 --> 00:04:36,912
- It's not right there.
- Okay.

115
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:38,700
- It's not right there.
- Okay, okay.

116
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,680
- It's more like right there.
- Gotcha.

117
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,360
- And you were throwing like right there.

118
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,610
- Gotcha, gotcha.

119
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,350
So, I shouldn't be throwing right there.

120
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,930
Be throwing right here, right?

121
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,763
- Yeah.

122
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:55,320
Ah, crap, I got my pants wet.

123
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,700
Here, chris, can you give me that towel?

124
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,710
- You should have
waterproofed your pants, man.

125
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,543
- Yeah, I know.

126
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:00,376
Wait a minute.

127
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,426
This towel's waterproof.

128
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:04,770
How am I supposed to clean my pants,

129
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,270
but when the towel's waterproof?

130
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,320
It doesn't do anything.

131
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,270
Look, water just bounces off.

132
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,190
Well, I guess my pants will forever be wet

133
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,990
'cause every towel here is waterproof.

134
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,640
- I don't think your
hands waterproof either.

135
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,590
Your hand got more wet than the towel.

136
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,361
- Oh yeah, look at that.

137
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:20,550
Non-waterproof, look at that crappy hand.

138
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,380
There's nothing good
about this hand at all.

139
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,450
- In that clip, we were
talking about Chris's hand

140
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,220
which clearly meant we
were about to start talking

141
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,330
about him moisturizing.

142
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,650
And now I'm sitting here listening

143
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,930
to two grown men talking
about Chris moisturizing.

144
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,300
And I'm just wondering where
I went wrong with life.

145
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,460
So, in EverDry's official video

146
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,620
they did this thing where
they outlined their logo

147
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,600
in EverDry and then shot paint at it

148
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,500
and it looked really cool.

149
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,520
So, I thought I'd redo it

150
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,583
in my office by spelling out
shop MrBeast on the wall.

151
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,190
- Hey look, it worked.
- No, Chris, it didn't work.

152
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,740
Not quite sure what the
fuck you're looking at.

153
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,580
We then made the big mistake
of giving two man childs paint

154
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,783
and a hot dog.

155
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,183
- Flying wiener.

156
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,780
Stop playing "Fortnite."

157
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,650
We have to make videos.

158
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,600
- Dude, every YouTuber
makes "Fortnite" videos.

159
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,980
Just gimme a couple months to get good

160
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,327
and we'll be fine, way easier.

161
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:13,710
Way easier than what we currently do.

162
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,543
- I'm sick of it, dude.

163
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:15,376
You know what?
- I just wanna

164
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,323
be like every YouTuber.

165
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,630
Yeah, I knew you would do that.

166
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,610
That's why I waterproofed my keyboard.

167
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,513
Watch this.

168
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,770
- It's still like pretty **** up.

169
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,500
- Well darn, I guess I can't
play anymore "Fortnite."

170
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,000
- Now we have to go...

171
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,540
- All right, I guess I'll make videos.

172
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,000
I know a lot of you guys
out there are atheists

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,150
and for all of you atheists,
please explain this.

174
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,430
This is how a paper normally reacts

175
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,720
when it's hit with water.

176
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,040
Pretty stereotypical.

177
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,270
Now, watch this.

178
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,650
If it's a piece of paper

179
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,623
with PewDiePie on it, look how it reacts.

180
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,440
It just bounces right off of him.

181
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,783
So atheist out there, explain that.

182
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:58,530
- Hm.
- Explain it!

183
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,760
It's like it never happened.

184
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,193
This is how a burrito
normally reacts to water.

185
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,370
As you can see, it's just, yeah.

186
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,990
See, this is a terrible burrito.

187
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,893
This is how a Chipotle
burrito reacts to water.

188
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,070
- It's kind of the same.

189
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,680
- We waterproofed this right, guys?

190
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,623
Why, does waterproofing
not work on burritos?

191
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,630
Now we have burrito on the floor.

192
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,040
- There's so much rice everywhere.

193
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,242
- They ask you how you are

194
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,200
and you just have to say that you're fine.

195
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,210
And you're not really fine,
but you just can't get

196
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,700
into it because they
would never understand.

197
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,230
- A lot of you guys are really young.

198
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,520
So, here's a recommendation

199
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,920
for all you parents watching
with your young kids.

200
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,590
See, instead of changing
their diapers all the time,

201
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,780
just waterproof them and you can just use

202
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,163
the same diaper forever.

203
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,103
- Nice.

204
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,820
- Chris, my work gloves are kind of dry,

205
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,200
will you moisturize them for me?

206
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,940
- I'm a moisturizing expert.

207
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,040
- Yeah?
- Here we go.

208
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,467
- Okay, all right.
- There you go.

209
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:00,390
- Chris, the moisture, it just falls off.

210
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,670
It appears my gloves are waterproof

211
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,990
which means they're moisture proof.

212
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,823
What do we do?

213
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,150
- Moisturize the stress away.

214
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,700
- Give it to me, boss.
- Here.

215
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,560
- My gloves are still waterproof.

216
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,170
- My hands are covered in moisturizer.

217
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,330
- But mine aren't.
- I'm super moisturized.

218
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,540
- But I'm not, oh.

219
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,610
All right, that was dumb.

220
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,400
We then proceeded to
torture Alexa by dipping her

221
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,550
in water as punishment for
not reordering my wet wipes.

222
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,383
Oh, whoa!

223
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,620
- Yeah, all right, let's
see how long it stays on.

224
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,393
- Wait, Alexa's waterproof?
- No.

225
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,531
- Oh God.

226
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:40,816
This is not a good idea.

227
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,210
- That's pretty cool.

228
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:46,410
Dude.

229
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,700
Alexa, don't give up.

230
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,058
Bro.

231
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:49,891
- There's a reason Jeff Bezos

232
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:51,120
is the richest man in the world.

233
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,260
- Yeah.
- Google Home

234
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,540
on the other hand was
listening to a conversation

235
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,250
I had one time in my living room

236
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,200
and now I'm on the FBI watch list.

237
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,790
So, take this, Google Home.

238
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,380
- So, this one literally will not come on.

239
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,003
If we unplug it, plug this
back in, watch it, wait for it.

240
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,650
- Up next, we have a
metaphor for you guys.

241
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,080
These boots are the Beast Gang Paulers.

242
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,090
And this water is the haters.

243
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,190
The haters, they just brushed right off.

244
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,320
The haters can't touch
us, Beast Gang Paulers.

245
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,910
We just dab all over 'em.

246
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,700
We're the strongest, most
lit-est family on the internet.

247
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,533
We look at that.

248
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,070
The haters are trying
to touch us, bullock.

249
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,800
Even when the haters
pile up, we just do that.

250
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,803
Boom, they're gone.

251
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:33,870
- [ Those boots really don't

252
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,490
like Mountain Dew, do they?

253
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,323
- Nope.

254
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,170
Oh gosh.

255
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,760
While we have this sacrifice going,

256
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,650
I think it's time we replace our memes.

257
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,640
- Let's replace our memes.

258
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,990
Hiro.
- Let's burn

259
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,823
our old memes.

260
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:48,510
Donating to attractive Twitch streamers.

261
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,103
It's saying I was milking it.

262
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,953
Am I gonna die?

263
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,357
- Memes are fun to burn.

264
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:56,433
Oh.
- Yeah.

265
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,660
Our second meme that must
be burnt is PewDiePie.

266
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,760
- It says meme review in Japanese.

267
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,080
- Be gone, PewDiePie.

268
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,123
- It's smokey in here.

269
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:07,170
- I know, is our fire
alarm gonna, oh wait,

270
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,550
we don't have one.

271
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,780
- We disabled our fire alarm

272
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,530
'cause we do so many indoor videos.

273
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:15,900
- Record it.
- Our next meme is,

274
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,130
is this good content?

275
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,660
We all know it's good content.

276
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,910
Let's put the fire right
on PewDiePie's face.

277
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,730
Adding 'nt a word doesn't make it funny.

278
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,100
PewDiePie reviewed it which
means now the meme's dead.

279
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,700
So, this one really has to burn.

280
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,840
Trying not to breathe and die.

281
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,513
See, look guys, this tissue is waterproof.

282
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,573
- Look at that.

283
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:38,463
- We're gonna use the waterproof
tissue to put out the fire.

284
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,301
Oh, take that fire.

285
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:43,851
Okay, hand it to me.

286
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,740
Sorry, I'm not trying to die.

287
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,420
- Well this went from a normal video

288
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,270
to let's burn stuff indoors and yeah.

289
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,400
- The moment you've all been waiting for.

290
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,380
We put water repellent on the bottom

291
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,090
of these Dundee flip flops.

292
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,360
Millions of years of
evolution have led us to this.

293
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,210
Will water repellent on my
feet allow me to walk on water?

294
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,383
Aw.

295
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:05,700
- Maybe you should walk
out a little further.

296
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,380
Maybe it just needs to take-
- Maybe, yeah.

297
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,090
Oh God, I'm losing my foot.

298
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,350
Where'd it go?

299
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,220
Oh God.

300
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,540
Okay, all right.

301
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,580
Well I lost my flip flop.

302
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,140
Oh I lost that one.

303
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,973
All right.

304
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:19,572
Well I'm just gonna walk in defeat.

305
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:21,393
- Ha ha, da feet.
