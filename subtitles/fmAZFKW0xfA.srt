1
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,330
Param, you are behaving as if
it's Dussehra, on the day of Holi.

2
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,887
Are you high?

3
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:32,139
The hemp can slow done,
but I am permanently high.

4
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:57,912
If you stare so much,

5
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:00,469
you will come down from the
category of a lover to a goon.

6
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:03,710
Hey, look.

7
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,629
Oh, God. I died.

8
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:12,618
Sister-in-law.

9
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:29,524
Param, the next festival
after the monsoon,

10
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,502
is the festival of Raksha Bandhan.

11
00:02:32,092 --> 00:02:33,120
Shut up.
- Think about it.

12
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:34,660
Be positive.

13
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:37,206
But Gurpreet you are right.

14
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:39,675
Maybe I will keep staring
at the girls

15
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:41,861
during the festivals
and keep shying away

16
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:43,395
and finally I will be ashamed
in my life.

17
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:44,487
Do one thing,
- What?

18
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:45,839
Get me married.

19
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:49,556
You canít even love
and you want to marry.

20
00:02:49,646 --> 00:02:51,932
I am not talking of my wedding
but of someone elseís.

21
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:55,181
You are aware in Punjab, love
happens during otherís weddings.

22
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:57,318
And in your own wedding,
others are scheming.

23
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,383
The girl is Jasmeetís friend.

24
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:02,328
So the guy is ours.

25
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,355
So find out, who will sacrifice.
Find out.

26
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:07,899
No worries, I have a scheme.

27
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,512
Who will stop Gurpreet Singh
from sacrificing

28
00:03:09,602 --> 00:03:12,271
in this whole village? Tell me?

29
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:13,349
Correct.

30
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,590
No aunt, donít,
I have already eaten 12 ice-creams.

31
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,424
If I eat any more I will be frozen.

32
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,529
How is that,

33
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:38,041
you are young and hot blooded,
if you eat even the ice will melt.

34
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,080
This is only ice-cream.

35
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,212
No, I donít want, my stomach is full.

36
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:43,608
You have eaten 12 ice-creams?

37
00:03:44,046 --> 00:03:45,875
And I have not even had one.

38
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:48,155
We had called 15 people
from his house.

39
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,244
He has come alone.
He deserves to eat the ice-creams.

40
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:54,105
Aunt, feed her.
Assume I have eaten it.

41
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,407
No, thatís not done.

42
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:57,710
She isnít your wife.

43
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:00,633
That if she eats
and it will enter your body.

44
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:04,578
Okay, then feed his wife.

45
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:05,627
Stop.

46
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:08,178
I am not married.

47
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,341
Engaged?
- No, I myself have stopped.

48
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:18,550
You must have had an affair.
- No.

49
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:22,601
But I had fallen in love,
last Dussehra.

50
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,005
With the one,

51
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,587
whom you keep staring
at all the festivals?

52
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:31,712
The loafers stare,

53
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,954
the lovers, gaze.

54
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,194
It is not ringing in your dreams.

55
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,070
Itís coming from there.

56
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:50,961
Listen.
- Yes.

57
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:54,310
I am making an excuse
and going to bring ice-creams.

58
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:57,686
Itís an excuse of returning late.

59
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,555
So that you both can sit together
and converse.

60
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:04,367
No aunt, what are you saying?

61
00:05:04,457 --> 00:05:06,294
Your heart must be happy.

62
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:09,045
If you are not interested,

63
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:11,696
go and eat ice-cream
with your friends.

64
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:17,171
I am leaving my stole here and going.

65
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,989
Hear it is.

66
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:23,910
Ice-cream.

67
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:27,305
Thank you, aunt.

68
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:30,353
But, Param is playing with fire.

69
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:34,128
Jasmeetís grandfather
is a very orthodox man.

70
00:05:34,593 --> 00:05:36,187
If he comes to know,

71
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,523
he will get the girl
married elsewhere.

72
00:05:39,984 --> 00:05:41,495
Greeting, blessings.
- Bless you.

73
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:43,321
It was very nice meeting you.

74
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,692
Any progress?

75
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:52,908
Half. 50%

76
00:05:52,998 --> 00:05:53,971
Means?

77
00:05:56,728 --> 00:05:57,919
From my side.

78
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:02,656
75%.

79
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,076
It has to be 100%.

80
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:20,454
Father is coming in 2 hours.
By then set it up.

81
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:38,732
Is this a movie?

82
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:40,524
Go down and guard the gate.

83
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:51,171
Jasmeet.

84
00:06:51,572 --> 00:06:53,357
Should we inaugurate our love?

85
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:55,896
Yes.

86
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,246
But I have a condition.
- Condition?

87
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:01,514
I want to work after the wedding.

88
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,922
I am a Jewelry designer,
and want to keep doing it.

89
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:09,645
But grandfather and brother
will never allow this.

90
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,705
There is only one reason
for me to live

91
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:16,230
that my husband
will be understanding

92
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:19,081
and will let me do
what my heart wants.

93
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:25,397
I have no right to make a decision.

94
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:28,607
But if I have the right
then the decision

95
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:30,489
will be in your favor.

96
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:44,152
The girl can predict,

97
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,943
whether the boy has
passed or failed,

98
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,735
by the way the boy holds her hand.

99
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:51,731
What is my result?

100
00:07:56,973 --> 00:08:01,069
You have ranked. First class first.

101
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:05,205
Param, the danger of you
both getting caught is increasing.

102
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:06,756
Is it?
- Yes.

103
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:10,175
Then start thinking of new excuses
from tomorrow.

104
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:12,325
Done.

105
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:16,867
Hello.

106
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:19,179
Bless me grandfather,
I am Mitti speaking.

107
00:08:19,406 --> 00:08:20,542
Bless you, dear.

108
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:22,217
The boy is coming to see me,

109
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:25,287
if you could send Jasmeet,
then my life would be easier.

110
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,619
Why not? Definitely.

111
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:35,288
Grandfather if Jasmeet
could help me in History...

112
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:36,456
Yes, dear.

113
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:39,396
Grandfather,
if Jasmeet could teach me

114
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:41,374
how to cook desert...
- Sure, dear.

115
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,547
Grandfather,
the boy is coming to see me.

116
00:08:43,627 --> 00:08:44,650
Again?

117
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:47,785
Sure, dear.

118
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:49,097
Greetings, grandfather.

119
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:50,769
If Jasmeet could...

120
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,698
If Jasmeet could,
if she could teach me to stitch.

121
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:57,639
Yes, why not, dear.

122
00:08:58,357 --> 00:08:59,741
Grandfather, bless me.

123
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,086
Send Jasmeet,
the boy is coming to see me.

124
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:06,281
Why donít you try fasting?
Or else this is go on forever.

125
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:08,400
Yes, I will try that too.

126
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:10,817
Donít you have any other excuse?

127
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:12,136
There are not so many boys in Punjab,

128
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:13,103
the number of times
you have used this excuse.

129
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:14,195
Arenít you ashamed?

130
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,816
Who will find
new excuses every day?

131
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:17,049
If it can be used, let it be.

132
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,012
Hurry up.

133
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:22,625
Sit down.

134
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:26,499
The gate is locked,
now nobody can come in.

135
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,585
Brother has to do for his brother.

136
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:31,590
Starters are not ready.

137
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:34,066
Get two cottage cheese pancakes.
- Sure.

138
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:39,720
Wow, my favorite.
Is it the sweet one?

139
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,395
Last time there was lot of salt.

140
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,610
Drink.

141
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:45,374
You are sad.

142
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:47,666
What happened?

143
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,480
So my lover has reached that stage

144
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,077
where he can x-ray me with his eyes.

145
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,261
What kind of lover is he,
if he canít know her heart?

146
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:04,964
Come on, tell me.

147
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:10,662
After seeing my designs,

148
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:13,376
a jewelry designer from Amritsar
has called me.

149
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:16,057
For the job of a consultant.

150
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:17,635
Thatís amazing.

151
00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:19,538
They are paying me well too.

152
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:23,366
Then why are you sad?
You should be happy.

153
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:26,566
I canít understand girls.

154
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:27,908
You canít understand girls

155
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:29,593
because girls are not supposed
to be understood.

156
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:32,426
Itís thrice in a week.

157
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:35,929
Grandfather and brother
have blankly refused.

158
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:41,227
Because I am a girl.
Thatís why I am barred.

159
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:44,446
Sorry.

160
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:47,745
Grandfather and brother
are doing wrong by stopping me.

161
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:50,621
Then I too will cheat with them.

162
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:54,610
Will you drop me to Amritsar,
thrice a week?

163
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:56,177
Itís a matter of three days,

164
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:59,078
so will have three excuses to drop
and pick you from Amritsar.

165
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,254
Done.

166
00:11:10,814 --> 00:11:12,690
Donít hug me like this, girl.

167
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:17,537
You donít know,
what all thoughts, run in my heart.

168
00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:22,925
Param, statue.

169
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:31,411
Such expensive, glares?

170
00:11:31,978 --> 00:11:33,530
You spent your whole salary
on this or what?

171
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,183
Itís my salary,
I can spend on whoever I want.

172
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:38,811
Now, what is this?

173
00:11:38,994 --> 00:11:40,560
New clothes for you. Wear it.

174
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:42,365
Have you started taking loans?

175
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:45,082
No, this is from my bonus.

176
00:11:57,848 --> 00:11:58,842
Hey, buddy.

177
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:00,879
Yes, father.
- Son.

178
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,619
You have been wearing this
since a week.

179
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:05,151
Take it out.

180
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:08,550
Or the municipality guys
will throw you out.

181
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,980
Greetings, grandfather.

182
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:23,400
Send Jasmeet,
the boy is coming for alliance.

183
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:25,747
Do boys come every day to see you?

184
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:27,795
Not every day, thrice a week.

185
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,865
Has your father fixed this,

186
00:12:29,955 --> 00:12:31,277
or is it written outside
your house,

187
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:32,840
see the girl on this day only.

188
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,533
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, is good.

189
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:39,149
Have I ever called you on Saturday
or Sunday or Tuesday or Thursday?

190
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:41,743
That is true.
All right. Best of luck.

191
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:45,768
Keep the phone away sometimes,
everyone has equal share on it.

192
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:50,312
Greetings, grandfather.
Its baby shower.

193
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:51,702
Congratulations.

194
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:52,999
Greetings, grandfather.

195
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:55,722
The other girls are having
their baby showers.

196
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:57,477
You are still stuck
with the boys alliances.

197
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,459
Whatís the matter?

198
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,793
Lala.
- Yes.

199
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:21,128
What happened?
- What happened?

200
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:22,943
What about Mitti?

201
00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:24,557
What happened to Mitti?

202
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,673
Did Mittiís alliance work out?

203
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:29,016
What was supposed
to happen to Mitti?

204
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:31,324
Since 6 months, every week,

205
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:35,138
she is meeting boys thrice,
so at least 72 boys have seen her.

206
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:36,816
Then what happened?
- Listen,

207
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:39,278
you may be big built.

208
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:42,837
But I too have grown up
watching wrestlers.

209
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,326
Donít talk nonsense.

210
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,932
I was just enquiring,

211
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:50,918
you have seen so many boys,
and then do you like any of them?

212
00:13:51,141 --> 00:13:52,767
What are you talking?

213
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,646
Mittiís wedding
has been fixed a year ago.

214
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:57,317
With Amarnathís son, Kapil.

215
00:13:57,688 --> 00:13:59,321
Who told you all this?

216
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:05,685
You are working behind our backs?

217
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:09,349
You are travelling
to Amritsar alone.

218
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:13,112
What is so wrong in working,
grandfather?

219
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:15,730
It is wrong to go against
our wishes.

220
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:19,451
Why is there so much disparity
between brother and me?

221
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,958
Itís a manís duty to feed a woman.

222
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:26,486
And a womanís duty is
to give birth to his children,

223
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:27,915
and take care of them.

224
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:30,244
That is the difference.

225
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:32,417
Find a groom for her.

226
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:43,540
Jasmeet, everything will be fine.

227
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,077
The iron is hot now, strike it.

228
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,005
Even if the house changes,

229
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:52,563
the fate of the girls
doesnít change.

230
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:55,579
Chill. Once you come to my house.

231
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,126
Then how does his rule
and regulations matter?

232
00:15:03,432 --> 00:15:04,989
Please, eat.

233
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:12,787
What was the need
of writing a letter?

234
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:14,303
You could have just told.

235
00:15:14,817 --> 00:15:16,683
For the first time, I am talking
about the marriage proposal,

236
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:19,052
so was hesitant.
I wonít do it next time.

237
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:22,508
What nonsense I am talking.

238
00:15:22,598 --> 00:15:25,247
If I meet Jasmeetís grandfather
for you marriage proposal then...

239
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:26,717
What will I get?

240
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:27,819
You will have to spend now,

241
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:29,451
after 5 years a granddaughter
or son.

242
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,641
I am not asking for any investment
scheme, but grandchildren.

243
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:35,099
Five years?

244
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:37,042
Gave 3.
- No, 4.

245
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:38,470
Done deal at 3 and half.

246
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,903
Done.
- Done.

247
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:52,772
Congratulations.

248
00:15:55,108 --> 00:15:56,621
Congratulations.

249
00:15:57,334 --> 00:15:59,367
Congratulations.

250
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,383
Congratulations.

251
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:07,445
Jasmeet, come.

252
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:38,732
Jasmeet is going to become
the daughter-in-law of your family.

253
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:40,889
But I have one condition.

254
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:44,737
Food, and clothes,
will be according to your wishes.

255
00:16:45,927 --> 00:16:48,019
But you have to promise one thing.

256
00:16:48,868 --> 00:16:52,813
But after the wedding,
Jasmeet will not go out to work.

257
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,583
The world is changing.
Then it's Jasmeetís wish.

258
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:06,218
There is no limit
for wishes and desires.

259
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:08,090
But itís about our society.

260
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:10,228
The world is changing,

261
00:17:10,672 --> 00:17:12,232
then why hasnít
the society changed.

262
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:14,253
I am elder than you.

263
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,981
Then too I am folding my hands
and requesting you.

264
00:17:17,071 --> 00:17:19,727
Sir, you are elder,
donít do this.

265
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:22,737
Then promise.

266
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:24,530
Promise.

267
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:44,058
Sorry, girl.

268
00:17:45,828 --> 00:17:48,215
I know how much you wanted to work.

269
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,998
Itís not about working,
or doing a job.

270
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,233
Itís about having the independence
of making your own decision.

271
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,705
Which I never had, nor ever will.

272
00:18:06,672 --> 00:18:08,451
Forget it, everything will be fine.

273
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:10,199
Nothing will ever be fine.

274
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,785
You are a man,

275
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:17,124
you will not understand.

276
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,384
I donít understand your desire
to live independently?

277
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:25,523
Father respected your grandfather
and promised him.

278
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,351
If you want,

279
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:31,893
I can still break this relation.

280
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:37,394
I dream,

281
00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:39,576
but I am not mad.

282
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:47,785
I had two dreams,

283
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:54,023
one to live my life
on my own terms.

284
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,465
And other to marry you.

285
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,241
The first one will not be fulfilled.
- Hey.

286
00:19:05,331 --> 00:19:06,939
Let me complete the second wish.

287
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:17,321
Okay, so where will you take me
for our honeymoon?

288
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,130
Honeymoon will begin here.

289
00:19:22,153 --> 00:19:25,026
Because you know,
when you hug me like this,

290
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:29,841
then what all kinds
of thoughts run in my heart.

291
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:32,427
Param.
- Jasmeet.

292
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,038
Greetings.

293
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,676
God bless, son.

294
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:50,071
Everything is alright.

295
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:52,855
Welcome.

296
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:57,184
You have become a stranger
after getting married.

297
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:58,845
We donít get to see you.

298
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:02,011
She wants to go to Switzerland
for honeymoon.

299
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,310
Switzerland.
- Honeymoon.

300
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:05,825
Means setting is final.

301
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,332
Wow. Congratulations.

302
00:20:08,898 --> 00:20:10,336
Hey, get a beer.

303
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:10,904
Sure.

304
00:20:10,984 --> 00:20:12,433
No, beer.
- Why?

305
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:14,978
Itís not finalized.
Where is the visa?

306
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:18,472
All the property, papers, income,
is in fatherís name.

307
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:20,431
Then I canít get the visa.
How will I go?

308
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,171
Why are you tensed,
when Gurpreet is around?

309
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:24,338
Itís a shame then.

310
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:26,940
Listen, you give all the documents.

311
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:30,254
I will gift you the honeymoon visa
on your wedding.

312
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,534
When will father help?
You donít worry.

313
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:34,244
You have a beer. Bring the beer.

314
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,228
Make a large one for me.

315
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:52,052
Did you make a large peg?

316
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,398
It is so diluted.

317
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:57,797
Are you in your senses?

318
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:02,602
I have never touched it,
and you sprayed it on me.

319
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,389
The enlightened one,
impart your knowledge elsewhere.

320
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:12,419
It only fell on  your clothes,
not down your throat.

321
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:15,905
Fell on my clothes. Rubbish.

322
00:21:16,853 --> 00:21:18,031
Param.

323
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:19,286
Apologize.

324
00:21:19,523 --> 00:21:22,408
It's okay. He has no manners.

325
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:24,351
He is your friend, he is our guest.

326
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:25,646
Let it be.

327
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:27,317
I will forgive the guest.

328
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,699
But how can I forgive my friend.
- Param.

329
00:21:31,404 --> 00:21:32,835
He has to apologize. Shut up.
- Param.

330
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,640
He has to make it right.

331
00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:36,665
Apologize.
- Param, leave me.

332
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,082
Say sorry.
- Param.

333
00:21:38,271 --> 00:21:39,882
Param, let me go.

334
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:42,406
Param let it be.
- Param, let me go.

335
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,681
Param, let me go.

336
00:21:50,658 --> 00:21:52,961
Param, you have insulted me
in front of everyone.

337
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:55,751
Itís okay.

338
00:21:57,653 --> 00:21:59,714
You have exploited me a lot
in friendship.

339
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,897
Now you will come to know about
the losses due to enmity with me.

340
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:06,809
You are in a mood of going to
Switzerland for your honeymoon.

341
00:22:09,674 --> 00:22:11,416
I will not allow your visa
to be passed.

342
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:14,738
And if you get your visa,

343
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,874
deal with me.

344
00:22:17,964 --> 00:22:19,165
Get lost.

345
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:21,601
I will not get your visa done.

346
00:22:23,187 --> 00:22:24,336
Watch now.

347
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:49,654
Thank you.

348
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:53,607
Your lunch. My lunch, check.

349
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,221
Phone, check.

350
00:22:57,315 --> 00:22:59,089
Glares, check.

351
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:02,497
Okay, I am leaving. Bye.

352
00:23:02,577 --> 00:23:03,871
Keys, check.

353
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,958
You can drive without the keys?

354
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,132
Why do I have the feeling that

355
00:23:13,222 --> 00:23:15,296
I am not going to get
this key back for free?

356
00:23:15,878 --> 00:23:17,677
Because the Jat,
has a bad character.

357
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:19,221
And he will not give anything
for free.

358
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:22,945
Now, I am getting very late.

359
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:24,417
Come.

360
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:26,930
Come.

361
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,171
Take it.

362
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:33,395
Leave me. Leave.

363
00:23:35,078 --> 00:23:36,069
Leave me.

364
00:23:36,506 --> 00:23:37,796
Leave me.

365
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,061
Leave.

366
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:43,589
Girl.
- Yes.

367
00:23:43,985 --> 00:23:45,681
Return back from abroad.

368
00:23:52,462 --> 00:23:56,279
Gurpreet Singh has cancelled
so many times that,

369
00:23:57,003 --> 00:24:00,228
I have no other option
to go abroad, except in my dreams.

370
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:03,206
But you have a good scheme
to go abroad.

371
00:24:03,296 --> 00:24:06,117
Cheap, pretty and long lasting.

372
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:09,917
I get depressed every morning.

373
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:13,930
Today donít get depressed,
but impressed.

374
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,968
Have to meet grandfather today,
have to go to your house.

375
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:20,107
Yes, that it is.

376
00:24:20,656 --> 00:24:24,807
So we have another chance
to talk about the job.

377
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:28,771
Lovely, my life is made.

378
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:32,934
No, life is yet to be set.

379
00:24:33,726 --> 00:24:37,545
You know, my character is bad.

380
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:39,692
Nothing is free.

381
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:42,298
Get started. Please start.

382
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:45,674
Leave.
- Donít be shy.

383
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,298
You havenít even brushed.

384
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:54,721
After one year of the wedding
you are talking of brushing.

385
00:24:55,688 --> 00:24:57,786
After 3 years
you will talk of bathing.

386
00:24:58,602 --> 00:24:59,862
You talk a lot.

387
00:25:00,088 --> 00:25:03,003
Then seal my lips.

388
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:21,934
Why do you make
your lover chase you?

389
00:25:22,014 --> 00:25:24,128
If you donít make
your guy chase you,

390
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:26,027
then he will chase someone else.

391
00:25:26,117 --> 00:25:30,143
You can make me run here or there,

392
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:33,640
this lover will always be behind you.

393
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:37,002
Today, convince grandfather
for my job.

394
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:41,451
Such a petty request,
I can kill for this.

395
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:42,721
Murder.

396
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:48,528
Son, itís been a year
since you are married.

397
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:54,213
I want my grandchildren voice
to echo in this house now.

398
00:25:56,742 --> 00:25:58,580
Unlike the working women.

399
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:01,796
Who for years are
after their career?

400
00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:05,467
Then keep visiting various doctors
and ask for help.

401
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:07,845
Do you understand?

402
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:19,218
Hello.
- Param.

403
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:21,923
Have to take Bhavri
for an injection.

404
00:26:23,023 --> 00:26:24,232
Okay, dad.

405
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:33,996
Make her also sit behind.

406
00:26:34,086 --> 00:26:37,278
Itís good if she walks a bit,
she has put on a lot of weight,

407
00:26:37,368 --> 00:26:38,513
bull will divorce her.

408
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:44,384
Jasmeet.

409
00:26:45,963 --> 00:26:47,069
Harpreet.

410
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:49,255
Who is she?

411
00:26:49,345 --> 00:26:52,421
Harpreet, she was studying with me
in high school.

412
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:56,081
She failed in 8th grade
so she never came back to school.

413
00:26:56,827 --> 00:26:58,721
She had never travelled
outside Amritsar.

414
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,420
She is married in London.

415
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,087
Hi, Jas.

416
00:27:05,552 --> 00:27:09,767
We are very, very sweet, yo.

417
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:14,615
You are so cute, totally.

418
00:27:14,705 --> 00:27:16,855
How are you?
When did you come from London?

419
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:17,943
How is Sukhwinder?

420
00:27:18,023 --> 00:27:20,586
Busy, busy, busy. You know.
He doesnít get a leave.

421
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,427
He is at a high post,
so has severe headaches too.

422
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:25,256
But I told him, hello, excuse me.

423
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:29,229
Itís been 5 years. I am going
to India, at times I miss a lot.

424
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:32,464
I get so nostalgic sometimes, Jas.
- I know.

425
00:27:32,554 --> 00:27:33,554
Oh, so itís only been 5 years,

426
00:27:33,644 --> 00:27:35,624
since you have shifted to London?
- Yes.

427
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:37,400
After listening
to your fluent English

428
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,695
I thought you were born there.

429
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,609
This is my husband. Param.

430
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:45,364
Hi.
- Hello.

431
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,217
He jokes a lot.

432
00:27:47,297 --> 00:27:49,002
I am not a jockey, I am a farmer.

433
00:27:49,192 --> 00:27:51,083
I have done M.Sc.,
in agriculture sciences.

434
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:54,626
I meant you are very humorous.
Funny.

435
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,239
Thatís why I cracked this joke.

436
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:03,271
So what does your husband do
at London?

437
00:28:03,574 --> 00:28:05,317
At Londonís Heathrow airport.

438
00:28:05,454 --> 00:28:08,176
He has the responsibility
of keeping the airport,

439
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:09,711
eco-friendly on his strong shoulders.

440
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:10,664
Wow.

441
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:13,205
Come home along with me,
we will catch up over a cold drink.

442
00:28:14,256 --> 00:28:16,098
Okay, you go.
Catch up over a cold drink.

443
00:28:16,265 --> 00:28:17,334
I will get her injected.

444
00:28:17,424 --> 00:28:19,067
Injection? Is everything alright?

445
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:20,197
Yes, everything is good.

446
00:28:20,317 --> 00:28:21,455
You, see this buffalo,
she is preggers,

447
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:23,461
so I am just going to take her
for a shot. Nothing else.

448
00:28:24,257 --> 00:28:26,649
Wow, you speak English so well.

449
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,540
You should be in London.

450
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,749
You are wasting your talent
by giving shots to the buffaloes.

451
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:32,781
Frankly I am telling you.

452
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:34,104
Okay, letís go.

453
00:28:34,194 --> 00:28:36,473
It was good meeting you.
- Same here.

454
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:40,786
I was sweating in this heat.

455
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:44,045
If you are healthier than me,

456
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,476
but to go out here,
have to wear 8 meter cloth.

457
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:48,195
You know what I mean.

458
00:28:48,315 --> 00:28:50,946
Really, in London,
I can just go like this,

459
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:54,053
and whoever I meet, Indian
or others, hello, hi, greetings

460
00:28:54,143 --> 00:28:55,240
and will leave.

461
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,776
But here if I leave,

462
00:28:56,866 --> 00:28:59,171
then there will be my MMS made
called, fun sister-in-law.

463
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:01,642
Do you remember Chutki?

464
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:04,591
How had a faint moustache?

465
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:07,346
Yes, moustache suits her.

466
00:29:08,756 --> 00:29:10,388
She is the hero of the house.

467
00:29:10,908 --> 00:29:13,686
After having two kids,
she went to college

468
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:15,502
and now she is a lawyer for women.

469
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:18,238
You too has
reached heights, Harpreet.

470
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:20,097
Yes, look at me.

471
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:23,958
I am no longer a village belle,
I mean I have worked on myself.

472
00:29:24,285 --> 00:29:26,182
I went to a night school,
did a course of a beautician.

473
00:29:26,272 --> 00:29:27,878
I taught myself English.

474
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:33,820
Means, bank account, kids,
I can manage all kinds of work.

475
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,398
Itís great.

476
00:29:35,766 --> 00:29:38,006
But you tell me,

477
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:39,932
first class first.

478
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:43,169
You had showed us the dream
to prove ourselves.

479
00:29:43,713 --> 00:29:46,002
We are conquering forts

480
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:49,985
and you have become a housewife and
giving injection to the buffaloes.

481
00:29:51,768 --> 00:29:52,737
What do you think?

482
00:29:53,444 --> 00:29:55,320
Did I not see the dream
of doing something?

483
00:29:56,558 --> 00:29:57,873
But you are also aware,

484
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,656
here girls donít have
any freedom to do anything.

485
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:03,259
Yes, I know.

486
00:30:03,715 --> 00:30:06,141
Thatís why girls like me marry
and run away from here.

487
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:10,795
Dreams like ours can
only be fulfilled by going there.

488
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,052
My dream will never be fulfilled.

489
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:15,873
The reason is Gurpreet Singh Karon.

490
00:30:16,224 --> 00:30:20,072
He was rude to my father
during the wedding.

491
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:21,652
Param raised his hands on him.

492
00:30:22,332 --> 00:30:23,525
Param did the right thing,

493
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:26,956
but Gurpreet is very influential.

494
00:30:27,553 --> 00:30:29,352
After a lot of effort also,

495
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:31,416
Param is unable to get the visa.

496
00:30:32,753 --> 00:30:34,959
I have a solution to your problem.

497
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,302
Gurnaam Singh Visa.

498
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:51,676
But will your hero,
take the illegal path?

499
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:01,638
Look.

500
00:31:01,728 --> 00:31:03,223
Where do I see?

501
00:31:05,891 --> 00:31:08,333
Should I write the property
in your name on this paper?

502
00:31:09,653 --> 00:31:11,397
Please see carefully. Get up.

503
00:31:11,631 --> 00:31:15,106
I have seen you very carefully.

504
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:17,050
Look, for a minute.

505
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:20,032
Harpreet has given,
the number of Gurnaam Singh.

506
00:31:21,037 --> 00:31:23,261
This can help us in settling
in England.

507
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:26,661
So todayís idea of the
wedding night was of Harpreetís.

508
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,938
You keeps doing this
to your innocent husband.

509
00:31:31,815 --> 00:31:33,409
Idea was of Harpreet,

510
00:31:34,443 --> 00:31:36,017
but it was my wish.

511
00:31:37,405 --> 00:31:40,540
You have looted me by emotions,
come, my girl.

512
00:31:40,918 --> 00:31:43,096
Please, not now. Listen to me.

513
00:31:44,227 --> 00:31:45,974
I am sure after seeing Harpreet.

514
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:49,388
After going to London
all out troubles will end.

515
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,898
Okay.

516
00:31:54,507 --> 00:31:55,856
But have to talk to father.

517
00:31:59,189 --> 00:32:01,360
I will not go anywhere
without his permission.

518
00:32:04,637 --> 00:32:05,614
Yes.

519
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,630
Carefully.

520
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,717
Father.

521
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,227
Yes.

522
00:32:14,907 --> 00:32:16,481
I wanted to talk to you.

523
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:18,025
Speak.

524
00:32:19,923 --> 00:32:21,023
Father, I...

525
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:24,689
Father, I mean...

526
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,747
Father, Param is unable
to tell you that,

527
00:32:26,837 --> 00:32:28,262
he wants to settle down in London.

528
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:34,125
Half of Punjab is settled there.

529
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:36,086
You also go there.

530
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,977
Father, you are happy
with my decision?

531
00:32:42,636 --> 00:32:43,486
Look,

532
00:32:45,187 --> 00:32:46,576
when I had a heart attack.

533
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:51,122
Then you were into the fields
like the bulls.

534
00:32:52,656 --> 00:32:54,722
After studying so much at Amritsar.

535
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:57,942
You never wished to stay
in the city.

536
00:32:59,305 --> 00:33:01,262
You have given 5 years
to the family.

537
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:03,387
That is...

538
00:33:05,457 --> 00:33:08,008
Now itís the time for your family.

539
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,910
I will call you
as soon as I get settled.

540
00:33:12,787 --> 00:33:14,744
You have to teach my children too.

541
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:20,616
I will come and teach that,

542
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:26,182
like my son is,
they too have to be like that.

543
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:29,750
Be like him.

544
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:31,057
Yes, father.

545
00:33:54,143 --> 00:33:55,012
Take this.

546
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:56,809
Look after, I will be back.

547
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:05,206
Where?
- Over there.

548
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:13,066
"Dance with joy."

549
00:34:13,146 --> 00:34:17,228
"Come, talk to me."

550
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:21,314
"You have good mannerism."

551
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:26,330
"I've given my heart to you."

552
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:29,039
"Dance with joy."

553
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,298
Enough.

554
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:32,451
Enough of it, dear.

555
00:34:33,022 --> 00:34:35,594
Enough.

556
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:42,599
You are a big star.

557
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,153
When you will sing
and the world will hear,

558
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:48,678
then they will forget
Wadali brothers.

559
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:52,271
Wadali brothers are two,
he is alone.

560
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:58,598
If he calls himself as both,
then he will be called a star.

561
00:35:00,404 --> 00:35:02,037
Darling, what are you seeing,

562
00:35:02,245 --> 00:35:04,793
bring snacks and drinks,
for the star.

563
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:07,996
And listen.
Donít put ice in the butter milk.

564
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:10,886
Starís voice is a gold mine.

565
00:35:11,214 --> 00:35:13,317
If he will ice there will a flood.

566
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:15,333
Yes.

567
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:20,738
Okay darling, go to the next room,
fill up the form.

568
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,943
Have you got money from father?
Deposit it.

569
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,826
Donít go without
drinking the butter milk.

570
00:35:31,451 --> 00:35:32,975
Good morning.

571
00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:34,999
Donít worry, darling,

572
00:35:35,256 --> 00:35:39,224
not only visa, I will send you
to America without passport too.

573
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:42,186
Okay, donít want to say,
then hang up the phone.

574
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,298
Look darling,

575
00:35:45,029 --> 00:35:48,018
he is being tensed, even after
being a client of Gurnaam Singh.

576
00:35:48,218 --> 00:35:50,029
Is it the first time that
I am sending anyone overseas,

577
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,752
without the passport.

578
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:55,589
He isnít tensed about going,

579
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:57,860
but returning back
after being caught.

580
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:00,591
Darling, some people do get caught.

581
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:02,867
But so does an aircraft crashes
every year.

582
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,221
Does that mean that

583
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:06,759
people get scared and stop sitting
in the plane.

584
00:36:07,926 --> 00:36:10,651
Sir, you give very good examples.

585
00:36:11,665 --> 00:36:13,746
You give good examples,
or give visa too.

586
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:17,323
Who are you?

587
00:36:18,823 --> 00:36:19,568
Who is he?

588
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:21,629
Do you have an appointment
or disappointment?

589
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:25,147
I will be disappointed if you
donít get the England done for me.

590
00:36:25,796 --> 00:36:28,829
Harpreet said, you will surely
make me reach England.

591
00:36:29,093 --> 00:36:31,376
Param Singh,
who never gets his visa?

592
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,595
Listen,
for young Punjabis to get visa

593
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,968
is as difficult as terrorist
getting heaven.

594
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:39,888
But darling, you donít worry.

595
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,735
I will make you reach your heaven.

596
00:36:43,028 --> 00:36:45,232
Canít I go alive, with a visa.

597
00:36:45,976 --> 00:36:49,266
Darling Gurpreet Singh Karon,
is not giving you the visa.

598
00:36:49,612 --> 00:36:51,980
And I will not let you stay
in India.

599
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:54,486
Father will not let me go by,
trafficking.

600
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:56,979
Darling, you are grown up,

601
00:36:57,224 --> 00:36:58,467
and still you are still scared
of your father.

602
00:36:58,662 --> 00:37:00,100
I was never scared of him,
even in my childhood.

603
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:02,522
But I respect him from childhood.

604
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,657
You have won my heart.

605
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,407
And along with it visa too.

606
00:37:16,198 --> 00:37:17,776
So much respect for parents.

607
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:24,742
Look.

608
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:26,788
Oh, your parents.

609
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:27,825
No, darling.

610
00:37:28,418 --> 00:37:31,283
This is Yashpal Singh
in front of the rickshaw.

611
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,295
Same to same Yashpal
is standing next to BMW.

612
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:38,035
And to make him stand next to a BMW

613
00:37:38,203 --> 00:37:40,262
is Londonís lady Maya.

614
00:37:40,484 --> 00:37:43,438
She had mercy on him,
got married to him

615
00:37:43,518 --> 00:37:45,173
and took him to London
and went away.

616
00:37:45,701 --> 00:37:48,508
Darling, this is the only way.

617
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:55,585
Darling, go to London and laugh.

618
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:57,334
You have started
laughing here, itself.

619
00:37:59,686 --> 00:38:03,056
Gurnaam, you have done it
without the visa.

620
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,062
I just canít stop laughing.

621
00:38:08,424 --> 00:38:09,980
I was going to bash him.

622
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,047
Then I remembered,

623
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:14,632
already Gurpreet has taken away
all our visas.

624
00:38:15,104 --> 00:38:16,247
If I hit him,

625
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:18,226
I will not even be able to go
to Bangladesh in my life.

626
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:19,900
But what did he say?

627
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,658
I canít even repeat it. Let it be.

628
00:38:22,218 --> 00:38:22,939
If you were there and heard it,

629
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:24,355
you would have murdered him,
Jasmeet.

630
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:26,224
But what did he say?

631
00:38:26,424 --> 00:38:27,577
He said, darling...

632
00:38:27,657 --> 00:38:29,168
No need to be romantic.

633
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,706
He said 'darling'.
- Oh.

634
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,377
He calls everyone darling.

635
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:36,306
He said you marry a girl
from London.

636
00:38:36,652 --> 00:38:38,410
She will get you a visa and
take you along with her,

637
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,410
you will get residency
after a few days, then divorce her.

638
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,440
Then come back here and
get married to Jasmeet again

639
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,035
and then go back to London.

640
00:38:45,485 --> 00:38:46,373
He said this.

641
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,367
Jasmeet there is
no use of getting angry.

642
00:38:57,457 --> 00:38:59,068
Listen to me, leave it.

643
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:00,211
Please.

644
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:03,124
Leave it. Please.

645
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:06,507
Mr. Gurnaam.

646
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,904
Param Singh has come with his wife.

647
00:39:10,308 --> 00:39:11,317
Should I increase your security?

648
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:14,776
My security is in my head.

649
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:16,189
Let them come.

650
00:39:19,868 --> 00:39:22,912
Sister-in-law. Greetings.

651
00:39:23,496 --> 00:39:26,161
I know you are very upset with me.

652
00:39:26,372 --> 00:39:28,783
Anyone will flare up,
since when I have constrained her.

653
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:32,458
Sister-in-law, your husband
is very handsome.

654
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:35,433
And handsome men are very foolish.

655
00:39:36,102 --> 00:39:38,010
I want to explain to you.

656
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,860
This is only...

657
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,029
That this will only be acting.
I understand.

658
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:44,518
You are not at all handsome.

659
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:46,340
So I thought
you will be intelligent.

660
00:39:46,816 --> 00:39:48,035
And if you are smart,

661
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:49,429
then I could not understand

662
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:51,395
why you were unable
to make him understand.

663
00:39:52,168 --> 00:39:55,063
I was so stupid, I was not
able to understand your reaction.

664
00:39:55,455 --> 00:39:57,249
Sister-in-law, I did not know,

665
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:00,004
that before explaining to you,
I have to explain him.

666
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:01,593
Or else I would have
explained earlier.

667
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,626
Happy, sister-in-law is looking.

668
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:06,921
Bring sweet on this joyous occasion.

669
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,584
Sweets for what?
No need of any sweet.

670
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:11,534
Sit. Sit down.

671
00:40:11,855 --> 00:40:13,804
Why are you sitting?
- Please be seated.

672
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,824
Hey, Jasmeet.

673
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,629
Darling, you must be watching movies.

674
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,467
I do, so.

675
00:40:19,557 --> 00:40:23,834
So when Shahrukh acts like
the husband of Deepika.

676
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:27,243
Then he doesnít cry or blabber
in front of the director.

677
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:31,207
Director sir, I am married to Gauri.

678
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:33,509
How can I marry someone else?

679
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:37,505
I cannot do acting of love
and marriage. I canít do.

680
00:40:37,595 --> 00:40:39,708
But who will be the director there?

681
00:40:39,864 --> 00:40:41,436
There will only be the lady and me.

682
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:45,615
And Gauri too never
gets suspicious of Shahrukh.

683
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:50,052
Because she knows, that Shahrukh
is just acting for her and kids.

684
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:53,587
Sister-in-law, you explain
much better than me.

685
00:40:54,095 --> 00:40:56,678
You get it,
you have to become Shahrukh.

686
00:40:56,851 --> 00:40:58,440
But Shahrukh is acting,

687
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,937
not going to a government office and
marrying in the morning with Deepika,

688
00:41:01,027 --> 00:41:03,165
then divorcing her and night
and marrying Gauri again.

689
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:04,470
What are you saying?

690
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,220
Your role is lengthier and
better than Shahrukh, darling.

691
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:09,646
This is a moment of happiness.

692
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:12,127
Darling, get inspired by Shahrukh.

693
00:41:12,693 --> 00:41:15,124
Donít focus on the time
but on acting.

694
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:17,024
What if I get more inspired.

695
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,366
What if the naughty man inside me
gets instigated?

696
00:41:19,575 --> 00:41:21,468
What if the lady
starts over acting?

697
00:41:22,321 --> 00:41:25,207
Darling, I will manage the lady.

698
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,120
But sister-in-law, if the actor
doesnít have faith on his acting.

699
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,892
Then what can I do?

700
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:32,331
What rubbish.

701
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:33,614
I am saying with right means,

702
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:36,129
neither can you go to London
nor to Tata.

703
00:41:43,857 --> 00:41:44,916
Donít scare me.

704
00:41:45,413 --> 00:41:48,212
If you want to get angry on me,
then do it.

705
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,864
You taunted me? I will slap you.

706
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:53,445
Have you gone mad?
Have you lost it?

707
00:41:53,964 --> 00:41:55,022
What nonsense
were you saying there?

708
00:41:55,102 --> 00:41:56,523
I will get married to another woman
and go away

709
00:41:56,613 --> 00:41:57,555
and it wonít affect you?

710
00:41:57,687 --> 00:42:00,742
It is not a real wedding.
Itís just a compromise.

711
00:42:01,401 --> 00:42:05,250
After compromising so much in life,
it has stopped effecting me.

712
00:42:06,406 --> 00:42:08,087
After all this, once we go there,

713
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:09,765
all compromises
will come to an end.

714
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:11,292
Please, understand.

715
00:42:12,785 --> 00:42:15,689
You want to play such a gamble
for your independence in life.

716
00:42:16,505 --> 00:42:20,209
Not only me, but any girl
who is living my life will agree.

717
00:42:21,824 --> 00:42:25,122
They donít even have a chance
to live their life.

718
00:42:26,052 --> 00:42:29,565
I have, and the reason is you.

719
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,519
Param, I trust you more than
my own self.

720
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,861
I can make a mistake,
but you will not.

721
00:42:40,128 --> 00:42:42,328
Jasmeet it does not matter
where we stay.

722
00:42:44,788 --> 00:42:47,172
With whom we stay
and how much they love me.

723
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:48,527
That makes the difference.

724
00:42:48,965 --> 00:42:51,485
Give me my independence here,
I will not go.

725
00:42:53,543 --> 00:42:55,864
Is it so wrong to dream?

726
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,388
There is no harm in dreaming.

727
00:43:00,506 --> 00:43:02,246
To fulfill it in the wrong way is.

728
00:43:03,987 --> 00:43:06,420
By doing this,
you are gambling your marriage.

729
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:10,619
But I cannot do this.

730
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:28,728
Param, come.

731
00:43:29,578 --> 00:43:31,713
Today you thought of me
after your wedding?

732
00:43:31,854 --> 00:43:33,382
Come, dear.
- Gurpreet,

733
00:43:35,751 --> 00:43:36,913
I have come to apologize.

734
00:43:38,734 --> 00:43:40,305
If you want I will apologize

735
00:43:41,707 --> 00:43:43,622
in front of the whole village.

736
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,880
No need to say sorry.

737
00:43:46,129 --> 00:43:48,350
You are my friend. I forgive you.

738
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,292
Thank you.

739
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:53,873
But...

740
00:43:57,775 --> 00:43:59,713
on whose legs you had made me fall,

741
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,489
let him bow down to my legs.

742
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,180
Then it is equal.

743
00:44:18,024 --> 00:44:20,738
Sister-in-law.

744
00:44:22,424 --> 00:44:25,171
I was tensed searching for you.

745
00:44:26,306 --> 00:44:28,435
What are you thinking? Come, sit.

746
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:30,145
I will drop you to London.

747
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,303
Sister-in-law, I will send you
to London on a work visa.

748
00:44:34,845 --> 00:44:35,711
Come.

749
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:37,451
Param.

750
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:40,131
The trouble has come.
- Param.

751
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:41,213
What happened?

752
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,259
You will not believe what happened.

753
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:44,456
I will, tell me.

754
00:44:45,256 --> 00:44:48,173
I got a job in London.

755
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:51,065
And you will go?

756
00:44:52,937 --> 00:44:53,981
Leaving me.

757
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:56,802
Alone.

758
00:44:57,385 --> 00:44:59,228
But we had spoken about this.

759
00:45:01,137 --> 00:45:02,942
We had decided.

760
00:45:15,157 --> 00:45:18,336
But you had promised,
that she will not do a job.

761
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:23,402
Grandfather,
she is just going on a work visa.

762
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,255
She will stay at my friends place
and enjoy her holiday.

763
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:29,007
Gurpreet should hear this.

764
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,716
Then he will say that,
he is making his wife overseas.

765
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,227
He will spoil
my reputation much more.

766
00:45:33,307 --> 00:45:35,291
He will forget.
But what will happen by then.

767
00:45:35,381 --> 00:45:38,381
My friend will somehow
get a residency for Jasmeet.

768
00:45:38,996 --> 00:45:42,910
Once I get the visa for residency.
No law can separate a couple.

769
00:45:43,102 --> 00:45:46,236
Jaspreet will call me there
and Gurpreet cannot do anything.

770
00:45:47,613 --> 00:45:48,606
Itís a plan.

771
00:46:15,908 --> 00:46:18,910
This is not the place, girl.

772
00:46:20,164 --> 00:46:22,435
You know,
when you hug me like this,

773
00:46:22,525 --> 00:46:25,796
then so many naughty thoughts
run in my heart.

774
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:31,969
This is the departure lounge.

775
00:46:33,342 --> 00:46:37,330
We may be separated, but
we should get a room at least.

776
00:46:37,947 --> 00:46:40,845
Donít try to make me laugh,
I will cry.

777
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,917
Donít stop me
from talking nonsense.

778
00:46:47,925 --> 00:46:49,244
Or else I will cry.

779
00:46:57,752 --> 00:46:58,906
I have...

780
00:47:02,076 --> 00:47:03,741
I have hidden something from you.

781
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:06,289
Jasmeet, letís go.

782
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:15,666
I am marrying Samar
and going on a marriage visa.

783
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:18,119
I am sorry.

784
00:47:18,931 --> 00:47:20,829
I have done all this for us.

785
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:24,393
Trust me. Forgive me.

786
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:27,062
Take care of yourself.

787
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:28,878
I have to go.

788
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:02,177
Grandfather.

789
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:12,802
Jasmeet.

790
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:17,028
Bless me, grandfather.
- Live long, dear.

791
00:49:17,108 --> 00:49:21,646
Samar would have sweet talked
a lot to you.

792
00:49:22,122 --> 00:49:26,846
But he is a number one rogue,
government official.

793
00:49:39,603 --> 00:49:42,770
Whether anyone understand or not,
you surely will,

794
00:49:42,964 --> 00:49:44,591
thatís why I dared to do this.

795
00:49:53,225 --> 00:49:54,152
Sam.

796
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:57,147
Hey, guys.

797
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:58,972
How's it going?

798
00:49:59,052 --> 00:50:01,287
Alright, thank you so much.

799
00:50:03,972 --> 00:50:06,252
The literacy levels of UK
are going to fall.

800
00:50:06,502 --> 00:50:08,664
Sam has imported such a villager.

801
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,659
Hey Sam.
- Hello, darling, how have you been?

802
00:50:18,805 --> 00:50:21,605
Happily and married.
How did all this happen?

803
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:27,113
Wait, let me guess.
Lust at first sight.

804
00:50:28,297 --> 00:50:29,586
But without a wedding,

805
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,259
a Punjabi girl would
not have agreed.

806
00:50:32,632 --> 00:50:34,978
No, it will be in your case.

807
00:50:35,864 --> 00:50:37,353
Lust at first sight but,

808
00:50:38,748 --> 00:50:40,685
the rest you had agreed
without the wedding.

809
00:50:41,107 --> 00:50:41,981
So I was right,

810
00:50:42,071 --> 00:50:43,986
she dint agree so you married her
and got her.

811
00:50:44,066 --> 00:50:45,121
Excuse me.

812
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:47,928
And by the way, like this...

813
00:50:50,145 --> 00:50:51,902
Jasmeet, this is Alisha.
Alisha, this is Jasmeet.

814
00:50:51,992 --> 00:50:53,380
Hi.
- Hello.

815
00:50:55,776 --> 00:50:58,267
You know what,
he is my childhood friend.

816
00:50:58,411 --> 00:51:00,070
And a very big idiot.

817
00:51:00,913 --> 00:51:02,927
If he troubles you,
just let me know.

818
00:51:03,529 --> 00:51:05,941
I want to set him right.
Isnít it, Sam?

819
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:10,321
Excuse me.

820
00:51:27,253 --> 00:51:28,307
Hello.

821
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:30,358
Itís me Jasmeet.

822
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:33,718
Not so many days have passed
that you have to tell your name.

823
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,486
You are upset with me?

824
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:37,832
You hate me?

825
00:51:38,275 --> 00:51:39,491
I am trying my best.

826
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,999
Even after 8 beers,

827
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:46,753
I still miss you
and not feel anger.

828
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:48,664
Why are you so nice?

829
00:51:49,603 --> 00:51:50,642
Scold me.

830
00:51:51,524 --> 00:51:52,808
Abuse me.

831
00:51:53,648 --> 00:51:55,377
Why did I do? How did I do?

832
00:51:55,467 --> 00:51:57,381
At least ask me that much.

833
00:51:57,562 --> 00:51:58,891
You had written,

834
00:52:00,607 --> 00:52:04,611
whether anybody else understands
or not, I will understand.

835
00:52:07,335 --> 00:52:09,236
So then I have understood,
what is there to ask.

836
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,371
'Sister-in-law,
you watch pictures,

837
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:15,209
I will tell you story.'

838
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,827
'The pictures are of the heroes.'

839
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:20,385
'Samar Singh Sandu, alias, Sam.'

840
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:22,416
'He has lot of wealth.'

841
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:24,270
'But he just has a relative
a grandfather.'

842
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,451
'Who is unwell
and is 90 years old.'

843
00:52:27,298 --> 00:52:29,838
'And on top of that he has cancer.'

844
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:32,019
'I have many girlfriends
in London.'

845
00:52:33,324 --> 00:52:34,813
'I have a rocking social life.'

846
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:38,051
'But my grandfather feels that
if I donít marry an Indian girl.'

847
00:52:38,243 --> 00:52:40,183
'Then my life style
will destroy my life.'

848
00:52:40,473 --> 00:52:42,103
'So for his happiness,'

849
00:52:42,384 --> 00:52:46,958
'Sam is marrying a beautiful,
Punjabi girl.'

850
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,240
'But fake.'

851
00:52:50,135 --> 00:52:51,969
'There will be no relation
between us.'

852
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:54,870
'You will not even touch me.'

853
00:52:55,563 --> 00:52:57,305
'You are doing it
for your grandfather,

854
00:52:58,449 --> 00:53:01,595
and I am doing
for citizenship of UK.'

855
00:53:03,282 --> 00:53:06,816
'For both these things,
till we require to remain married,

856
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,179
we will.'

857
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:13,628
'Sister-in-law, donít let Sam know
that you are already married.'

858
00:53:14,115 --> 00:53:17,118
'Or else the deal will break.'

859
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,715
Itís okay
if the world says I am wrong.

860
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,703
Will you forgive me?

861
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:25,483
Then I donít care about the world.

862
00:53:26,947 --> 00:53:28,477
I had forgiven you at the airport.

863
00:53:30,034 --> 00:53:31,645
Or else you would
not have boarded the flight.

864
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,001
And I would not be at home,
but at the jail.

865
00:53:36,591 --> 00:53:40,583
Because you are so good,
I take advantage of you.

866
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:42,775
Getting married again
despite of being married,

867
00:53:42,865 --> 00:53:44,192
and you call it taking advantage?

868
00:53:44,475 --> 00:53:46,710
Param, this is not a marriage.

869
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:48,139
And our wedding?

870
00:53:49,401 --> 00:53:50,447
Does that remain a marriage?

871
00:53:50,537 --> 00:53:52,645
Remains, absolutely.

872
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:55,564
Even if you would have to London
then also it would have remained.

873
00:53:56,136 --> 00:53:58,633
I have come here,
then also it will remain.

874
00:53:59,288 --> 00:54:00,676
And will remain forever.

875
00:54:02,168 --> 00:54:06,114
You just wait for me to come
and fetch you here.

876
00:54:17,077 --> 00:54:21,888
Whether you are here or there,
you are good at waiting.

877
00:54:23,974 --> 00:54:25,162
Not I.

878
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,507
I want to go to London.

879
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:35,603
Legal, illegal. Everything is fine.

880
00:54:38,893 --> 00:54:41,338
Darling, before Gurpreet
comes to know,

881
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:42,688
you go along with my men,

882
00:54:42,778 --> 00:54:45,832
you cross Bengal
and enter Bangladesh.

883
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:48,672
From Dhaka, you take a small boat,
and in the middle of the ocean,

884
00:54:48,762 --> 00:54:51,426
you will be transferred
to a bigger boat.

885
00:54:51,635 --> 00:54:53,654
From where you will reach Brussels.

886
00:54:57,272 --> 00:54:59,255
What happened? Are you mad?

887
00:54:59,615 --> 00:55:01,474
There are more than 50 people here,

888
00:55:02,772 --> 00:55:07,301
and I thought that only my girl
is crazy after England.

889
00:55:08,112 --> 00:55:09,179
Jasmeet.

890
00:55:12,036 --> 00:55:14,155
We need to take some
new clothes for you. Letís go.

891
00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:17,993
New clothes? I have clothes.

892
00:55:18,998 --> 00:55:20,552
You canít wear
these kinds of clothes in my circle,

893
00:55:20,642 --> 00:55:21,867
to look like my wife.

894
00:55:22,371 --> 00:55:23,230
You need a makeover.

895
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:37,713
Jasmeet, hold on.
I am going to pay for it.

896
00:55:38,019 --> 00:55:40,118
No, I have money.

897
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,238
We will only do that much
for each other,

898
00:55:42,328 --> 00:55:44,301
what we had promised.

899
00:55:45,691 --> 00:55:46,590
Thank you.

900
00:55:53,732 --> 00:55:54,761
Awesome.

901
00:55:55,511 --> 00:55:57,565
Girl, bless you dear.

902
00:55:57,655 --> 00:55:59,818
You have brought me back
to my roots.

903
00:56:00,597 --> 00:56:02,436
Without the tickets.

904
00:56:03,732 --> 00:56:06,393
Even my accent has changed.

905
00:56:06,608 --> 00:56:10,127
I am saying,
tic kas instead of tickets.

906
00:56:14,068 --> 00:56:18,720
My dear, now I can
attain salvation definitely.

907
00:56:19,073 --> 00:56:22,490
That too without effort.

908
00:56:28,575 --> 00:56:30,266
Move aside.

909
00:56:32,229 --> 00:56:34,424
Give me some more.
Itís less for me.

910
00:56:34,514 --> 00:56:36,975
Here you will only get this much.
Old man. Move.

911
00:56:45,916 --> 00:56:49,242
What to do,
have to bear this much.

912
00:56:50,284 --> 00:56:52,785
Have left Punjab in search
of a job to get food.

913
00:56:55,818 --> 00:56:58,060
Grandfather, you can get food
at a Gurudwara too.

914
00:56:59,213 --> 00:57:01,497
You can get however much you want,
that too free.

915
00:57:06,296 --> 00:57:10,170
We go overseas for luxuries,
like bungalows and cars.

916
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,102
Not because of food.

917
00:57:12,397 --> 00:57:14,937
From Brussels you will go
to Paris via train.

918
00:57:15,174 --> 00:57:17,661
Because when once you enter Europe,

919
00:57:17,836 --> 00:57:19,937
then they donít check
your passport.

920
00:57:20,986 --> 00:57:23,826
The biggest danger
of the whole journey is

921
00:57:23,916 --> 00:57:25,259
at Clive check post.

922
00:57:25,459 --> 00:57:28,525
The check using carbon dioxide,

923
00:57:28,697 --> 00:57:30,368
if anyone is hidden
inside the truck.

924
00:57:30,794 --> 00:57:33,152
You have to cover your head
with a plastic bag.

925
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:36,081
And whatever happens,
even if you lose your life,

926
00:57:36,171 --> 00:57:38,473
the bag should not be taken out.
Remember it.

927
00:57:54,317 --> 00:57:55,756
London girl.

928
00:57:57,706 --> 00:58:01,164
If I wasnít married,
I would have surely married you.

929
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,110
What have you become?

930
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,125
Where are you staying?

931
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,590
Donít worry about me,
I have planned everything.

932
00:58:20,397 --> 00:58:22,148
I had told you in Punjab,

933
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:26,624
I had no problem, of you having
a fake wedding and coming here.

934
00:58:27,121 --> 00:58:28,917
Then why do you have a problem?

935
00:58:31,337 --> 00:58:32,604
I had also said there,

936
00:58:33,716 --> 00:58:35,233
that I donít have a problem,
in you coming here.

937
00:58:35,965 --> 00:58:38,122
Problem is of lies,
with this drama.

938
00:58:38,202 --> 00:58:40,176
I am doing this drama
for both of us.

939
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,543
For us to settle down here.

940
00:58:43,574 --> 00:58:47,308
Till we get a visa to stay.
I will do whatever possible.

941
00:58:48,363 --> 00:58:51,531
I will have to lie to Samar.
I will lie.

942
00:58:53,261 --> 00:58:56,435
I have taken such a big risk,
lowered myself in everyoneís eyes.

943
00:58:56,525 --> 00:58:57,923
And I have come here.

944
00:59:00,385 --> 00:59:04,039
Param, now I will not go back.
Whatever happens?

945
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:08,602
Your grandfather, your whole family
did wrong with you.

946
00:59:08,883 --> 00:59:11,874
For that you canít take revenge
from the whole world.

947
00:59:12,677 --> 00:59:14,648
The war is only fought,
where it belongs to.

948
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:19,806
I...

949
00:59:31,186 --> 00:59:32,710
Hello.
- Hey itís me.

950
00:59:33,787 --> 00:59:35,638
Listen we have to go
for the inauguration of Zaika.

951
00:59:36,148 --> 00:59:36,932
Zaika?

952
00:59:37,132 --> 00:59:38,123
Itís an Indian restaurant.

953
00:59:38,557 --> 00:59:40,878
You reach home,
we should be leaving soon.

954
00:59:41,824 --> 00:59:43,012
Okay, I coming.

955
00:59:48,387 --> 00:59:52,105
I have to go for the inauguration
of an Indian restaurant.

956
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:53,904
I have to go.

957
00:59:54,419 --> 00:59:56,562
You are just tasting this place
or have started working too?

958
00:59:58,354 --> 00:59:59,542
For which, you had come here.

959
01:00:03,759 --> 01:00:04,977
The job that I want to do,

960
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:07,541
I cannot do,
till I get my residency.

961
01:00:08,255 --> 01:00:09,644
Itís not possible legally.

962
01:00:11,801 --> 01:00:13,452
But I have prepared everything.

963
01:00:14,168 --> 01:00:16,525
Spoken to the Jewelers,
my designs are ready too.

964
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:17,778
Everything is ready.

965
01:00:18,677 --> 01:00:20,147
Once I get my residency.

966
01:00:21,509 --> 01:00:22,901
Nobody can stop me.

967
01:00:32,726 --> 01:00:35,223
Jasmeet I thought it was
your childishness.

968
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:39,866
But this city has become
your obsession.

969
01:00:43,629 --> 01:00:44,888
First time...

970
01:00:45,986 --> 01:00:48,797
I am witnessing a womanís affair
not with a man, but with a city.

971
01:00:53,564 --> 01:00:55,057
Since I have come already,

972
01:00:55,147 --> 01:00:56,452
let me see after all
what this city is about.

973
01:00:59,454 --> 01:01:00,930
But Girl, remember.

974
01:01:02,384 --> 01:01:03,586
I am a true lover.

975
01:01:05,259 --> 01:01:07,519
I will only be in peace

976
01:01:09,021 --> 01:01:11,594
after removing
this obsession from you.

977
01:01:21,508 --> 01:01:25,260
Finally after reaching London,
you will meet a man,

978
01:01:25,443 --> 01:01:28,572
whose name is Iqbal Khan,
from Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

979
01:01:29,021 --> 01:01:30,726
Darling, he will help you onwards.

980
01:01:32,663 --> 01:01:34,200
Param.
- Yes.

981
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:36,089
So you are an army man.

982
01:01:36,816 --> 01:01:38,939
I am a farmer. Doing M.SC.

983
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,816
A fresher from Punjab.

984
01:01:41,345 --> 01:01:43,523
Here illegal guys
are called army men.

985
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:44,906
Oh, thatís respect.

986
01:01:46,339 --> 01:01:49,302
In our country, an army man
expels the illegal guys.

987
01:01:50,523 --> 01:01:51,875
You are a jolly guy.

988
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:55,203
You come along me
to Buckingham Palace. Come on.

989
01:01:56,155 --> 01:01:58,212
This is your Buckingham Palace.

990
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:01,252
Only the queens donít live here,
only the kings.

991
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,757
This is Shyam.

992
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,223
And he is Murlidharan.

993
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:08,990
And thatís mine.

994
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:13,117
Illegal Asian tigerís versus
legal home department of England.

995
01:02:14,393 --> 01:02:16,043
Since 10 years the trophy
belongs to us.

996
01:02:16,186 --> 01:02:19,707
I will teach you the trick
of roaming freely as the army men.

997
01:02:21,636 --> 01:02:22,895
My bed?

998
01:02:25,343 --> 01:02:27,354
We wonít let you sleep
in the drawing room.

999
01:02:28,868 --> 01:02:31,320
This is your lavish bed room.

1000
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:32,830
This is the bathroom.

1001
01:02:33,701 --> 01:02:36,583
From morning 6 to night 10.

1002
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:38,686
After that,

1003
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:43,486
it turns into a bedroom.

1004
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:46,069
But you have to sleep
after 10 o clock.

1005
01:02:46,252 --> 01:02:48,350
Come, I will show you more.

1006
01:02:49,387 --> 01:02:51,067
Keep the empty boxes.

1007
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:55,024
She is my wife and,
she my daughter.

1008
01:02:55,615 --> 01:02:58,063
When I left home, she was still
in her motherís womb.

1009
01:03:00,731 --> 01:03:02,191
I saw her on video call.

1010
01:03:06,005 --> 01:03:09,006
But I could never pull her cheeks.

1011
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:13,399
Could never play with her
on my lap.

1012
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,297
This is the biggest problem
of the Punjabis.

1013
01:03:20,826 --> 01:03:23,604
Whenever we meet the other Punjabi
the flood of tears start flowing.

1014
01:03:24,773 --> 01:03:27,129
Oh, my kids, my wife.

1015
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:31,652
If we loved them so much,
then why did we leave our land?

1016
01:03:31,742 --> 01:03:33,201
And come to London to earn pounds.

1017
01:03:36,135 --> 01:03:38,313
But I have an answer for it.

1018
01:03:39,128 --> 01:03:41,987
Even if I am not there,
their lives are sorted.

1019
01:03:43,377 --> 01:03:44,414
Life is set.

1020
01:03:48,046 --> 01:03:49,926
This answer of yours is wrong.

1021
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:53,687
You are here, she is there.

1022
01:03:55,495 --> 01:03:56,765
How is their life sorted?

1023
01:03:59,073 --> 01:04:00,840
I started off, on the first day.

1024
01:04:01,473 --> 01:04:04,182
You enjoy. I will get beer.

1025
01:04:04,262 --> 01:04:07,024
Then will cry, I mean will talk.

1026
01:04:07,451 --> 01:04:08,342
Letís go.

1027
01:04:11,192 --> 01:04:12,695
Iqbal.
- Yes.

1028
01:04:12,775 --> 01:04:14,166
Show me an address?

1029
01:04:15,506 --> 01:04:17,352
Rest of the beer
I will drink there.

1030
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,151
Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1031
01:04:25,994 --> 01:04:26,977
Cheers.

1032
01:04:33,378 --> 01:04:34,478
This is for you.

1033
01:04:37,638 --> 01:04:38,878
What is this?

1034
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:41,752
For what you have done
for grandfather.

1035
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:43,921
This is nothing
in comparison of that.

1036
01:04:46,211 --> 01:04:48,947
A girl can make so much
of a difference in someoneís life.

1037
01:04:49,357 --> 01:04:50,580
I learnt, after meeting you.

1038
01:04:52,385 --> 01:04:53,397
Thank you for the lesson.

1039
01:04:56,568 --> 01:04:57,893
Trust me, itís a gift.

1040
01:04:58,535 --> 01:05:00,356
Please, no gifts.

1041
01:05:02,157 --> 01:05:03,533
I donít want to divorce you.

1042
01:05:05,227 --> 01:05:06,571
Because I really like you.

1043
01:05:07,757 --> 01:05:09,306
You are a fantastic person.

1044
01:05:09,713 --> 01:05:13,736
You are attractive,
and we are formally married too.

1045
01:05:13,816 --> 01:05:15,605
Jasmeet Malhotra.

1046
01:05:19,768 --> 01:05:21,790
Finally you reached London.

1047
01:05:22,027 --> 01:05:25,538
Wow,
thatís what I called a Desi Hunk.

1048
01:05:25,628 --> 01:05:28,027
Oh God, one more Indian.

1049
01:05:28,513 --> 01:05:31,356
UK, government
should ban these Indians.

1050
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:33,642
You speak another word about him.

1051
01:05:34,687 --> 01:05:36,492
And I am going to kill you.

1052
01:05:38,557 --> 01:05:41,271
Do you guys know each other?
Know each other?

1053
01:05:42,979 --> 01:05:44,822
We both marry...

1054
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:46,029
Wedding.

1055
01:05:48,526 --> 01:05:50,365
We both used to go
to the village weddings

1056
01:05:50,455 --> 01:05:54,301
and whack ice-creams
and sweets and deserts.

1057
01:05:54,391 --> 01:05:56,333
Thatís why our bodies
are like this.

1058
01:05:56,926 --> 01:05:58,696
You should have told.
- By the way, I am Sam.

1059
01:05:59,347 --> 01:06:00,528
Nice to meet you, man.

1060
01:06:01,174 --> 01:06:03,617
Actually Jasmeet will give
a better introduction of mine.

1061
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:05,090
Introduce me, Jasmeet.

1062
01:06:07,877 --> 01:06:10,740
He is Param Singh. My...

1063
01:06:12,623 --> 01:06:14,315
He is my...
- Neighbor.

1064
01:06:15,845 --> 01:06:17,996
You took so long to say neighbor.

1065
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:20,293
Your Hindi has become poor,
in London.

1066
01:06:20,383 --> 01:06:22,491
But donít worry,
I will improve your Hindi.

1067
01:06:22,581 --> 01:06:24,412
Sam we are neighbors.
- Okay.

1068
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:34,718
Hey gorgeous lovely people.

1069
01:06:34,808 --> 01:06:37,016
Ladies and gentleman,
we know that you.

1070
01:06:37,106 --> 01:06:39,534
All like to do a bit of Bhangra.

1071
01:06:39,813 --> 01:06:44,884
So girls and boys, get ready,
letís get some dancing.

1072
01:06:49,976 --> 01:06:51,328
Jasmeet, you were amazing.

1073
01:06:51,944 --> 01:06:53,539
You have hidden
a lot about yourself.

1074
01:06:53,619 --> 01:06:55,727
This is just the beginning. Sam.

1075
01:06:55,987 --> 01:07:00,221
She is a stock of surprises.
She has surprises in Kilos.

1076
01:07:00,852 --> 01:07:03,582
Look she doesnít get angry.

1077
01:07:04,182 --> 01:07:07,058
But when she rolls her eyes
that means it time to shut up.

1078
01:07:09,242 --> 01:07:10,478
Param, can I drop you somewhere?

1079
01:07:10,949 --> 01:07:12,625
I always get dropped by girls.

1080
01:07:13,598 --> 01:07:14,531
You too drop me.

1081
01:07:14,611 --> 01:07:16,352
Come, my car is right there,
see you guys.

1082
01:07:16,442 --> 01:07:17,775
Bye.
- Bye.

1083
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:20,344
It was nice meeting you, Sam.
- You too, Param.

1084
01:07:20,712 --> 01:07:21,800
I will see you soon.
- Yes, surely.

1085
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:24,557
Jasmeet, I will be there,
waiting for you. - Yeah.

1086
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:28,923
It was very nice
meeting you too, Jasmeet.

1087
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:29,870
We will dance again,

1088
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,604
I mean will meet again.

1089
01:07:33,338 --> 01:07:36,409
Yes, we have to meet.

1090
01:07:39,016 --> 01:07:42,238
Donít trouble Alisha much.

1091
01:07:42,508 --> 01:07:45,254
And donít let her trouble you also.

1092
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:49,124
I can take my guarantee, not hers.

1093
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,533
Alisha, where have you got me?

1094
01:07:58,681 --> 01:08:00,907
This seems like a hill station
in London.

1095
01:08:01,913 --> 01:08:03,323
How does it matter?

1096
01:08:05,989 --> 01:08:09,535
Donít bite, it will help me
in wearing spectacles in old age.

1097
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:19,196
Whatís wrong, Param?

1098
01:08:20,788 --> 01:08:22,031
You donít find me attractive?

1099
01:08:22,626 --> 01:08:24,039
Attractive?

1100
01:08:25,254 --> 01:08:26,790
If in Punjabi
we have a girl like you,

1101
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,810
then we call it Diwali Bumper.

1102
01:08:29,956 --> 01:08:31,577
Then why are you acting funny?

1103
01:08:33,675 --> 01:08:36,508
I hope you have a reason
to act like this?

1104
01:08:38,756 --> 01:08:39,930
Wedding.

1105
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:42,288
I am married man.

1106
01:08:45,124 --> 01:08:45,969
Param,

1107
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:49,099
I like experienced men.

1108
01:08:49,179 --> 01:08:50,649
I am married to Jasmeet.

1109
01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:53,248
And I have come to London for her.

1110
01:09:09,028 --> 01:09:10,815
Punjabi girl was looking so...

1111
01:09:11,612 --> 01:09:13,316
Sam, what are you doing?

1112
01:09:13,667 --> 01:09:14,606
What are you doing?

1113
01:09:14,856 --> 01:09:16,715
Helping you to decide.

1114
01:09:17,106 --> 01:09:18,976
Sam, please.

1115
01:09:21,009 --> 01:09:22,035
You know what,

1116
01:09:23,203 --> 01:09:24,792
I am not used to hearing a no.

1117
01:09:27,365 --> 01:09:29,581
We both had promised something
to one another.

1118
01:09:30,695 --> 01:09:32,727
I am abiding my promise.

1119
01:09:34,489 --> 01:09:35,797
You too abide.

1120
01:09:36,446 --> 01:09:37,960
What if I break my promise?

1121
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,008
What if I donít divorce you?

1122
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,384
Do you know,
if today I tell Jasmeet,

1123
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:00,782
that live in London without me?

1124
01:10:02,315 --> 01:10:04,131
Or come back to India with me.

1125
01:10:04,682 --> 01:10:06,561
She will come quietly come back
with me.

1126
01:10:07,018 --> 01:10:09,296
She loves me so much, mad girl.

1127
01:10:10,931 --> 01:10:14,402
But I donít want her to be helpless
and take this decision.

1128
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:17,818
I want her to take the decision
with her heart.

1129
01:10:19,245 --> 01:10:23,062
If there were more boys like you.
Then I too would have been married.

1130
01:10:24,857 --> 01:10:26,154
So, I will help you to stay.

1131
01:10:26,933 --> 01:10:27,666
Thank you.

1132
01:10:27,938 --> 01:10:29,448
But what is the point
of just staying.

1133
01:10:31,537 --> 01:10:33,732
I donít think, Jasmeet will go back
to India again.

1134
01:10:35,472 --> 01:10:39,825
In todayís world, marriage, love,
has no importance.

1135
01:10:39,905 --> 01:10:41,132
Has no value.

1136
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:44,104
Even today there is
only one thing left.

1137
01:10:45,223 --> 01:10:46,695
On which the whole world
is dependent.

1138
01:10:48,056 --> 01:10:49,242
Love.

1139
01:10:51,602 --> 01:10:55,152
My Jasmeet will surely come back,
and I know how.

1140
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:00,575
You get married to me.

1141
01:11:04,986 --> 01:11:05,902
Fake.

1142
01:11:10,511 --> 01:11:12,002
If she finds me making a mistake.

1143
01:11:12,857 --> 01:11:15,624
Maybe she herself
will realize her mistake.

1144
01:11:16,878 --> 01:11:18,766
Mad girl will understand.

1145
01:11:19,798 --> 01:11:23,581
To first hurt someone and then
search for happiness is stupidity.

1146
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,303
Itís stupid.

1147
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:28,182
Itís very profound.

1148
01:11:30,368 --> 01:11:32,575
And it sounds like fun. I must say.

1149
01:11:33,591 --> 01:11:34,564
Okay, I am ready.

1150
01:11:35,689 --> 01:11:36,823
But here is the deal.

1151
01:11:38,596 --> 01:11:40,083
Till the exact time of the wedding,

1152
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:42,823
if Jasmeet realizes her mistake,

1153
01:11:43,234 --> 01:11:45,191
and she is ready to go
to India with you.

1154
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:46,863
Then itís fine.

1155
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:49,331
But if it doesnít happen.

1156
01:11:50,315 --> 01:11:51,644
Then there will
surely be a wedding.

1157
01:11:53,137 --> 01:11:54,534
Not a drama but for real.

1158
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,345
Means.

1159
01:11:59,829 --> 01:12:01,602
You will not marry me otherwise,

1160
01:12:02,792 --> 01:12:04,863
this is my single chance
to marry you.

1161
01:12:07,181 --> 01:12:08,654
So are you ready for this bet.

1162
01:12:12,704 --> 01:12:14,105
I am serious, Param.

1163
01:12:15,569 --> 01:12:17,171
I know you are serious.

1164
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:21,488
Done.

1165
01:12:22,315 --> 01:12:24,238
I trust my Jasmeet completely.

1166
01:12:24,434 --> 01:12:25,782
And I believe this world.

1167
01:12:27,244 --> 01:12:28,433
Let see who wins.

1168
01:12:29,459 --> 01:12:30,735
The game starts tomorrow.

1169
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:48,831
What happened, guys?
Why arenít you all sleeping?

1170
01:12:49,557 --> 01:12:50,725
His daughter is unwell.

1171
01:12:56,013 --> 01:12:57,294
What happened?

1172
01:12:58,629 --> 01:13:00,051
Got a call from the hospital.

1173
01:13:01,905 --> 01:13:02,836
She is admitted there.

1174
01:13:07,213 --> 01:13:08,332
Have faith.

1175
01:13:09,796 --> 01:13:10,933
Everything will be fine.

1176
01:13:12,672 --> 01:13:13,746
I trust him only.

1177
01:13:15,028 --> 01:13:16,758
Otherwise, I have done
what my heart desired.

1178
01:13:38,012 --> 01:13:39,368
Alisha.

1179
01:13:41,082 --> 01:13:42,031
You look lovely.

1180
01:13:42,121 --> 01:13:44,499
Thank you. How are you?
- Very nice.

1181
01:13:45,341 --> 01:13:46,813
Hi, Jasmeet.
- Ht.

1182
01:13:47,904 --> 01:13:48,932
You look beautiful.

1183
01:13:49,894 --> 01:13:53,036
So, yesterday nightís dance,
and todayís surprise party?

1184
01:13:53,548 --> 01:13:55,073
Is there really a surprise or...?

1185
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:58,758
What will be the surprise
if I tell you?

1186
01:13:59,525 --> 01:14:02,264
I had told you, we will meet again.

1187
01:14:02,898 --> 01:14:05,551
I had told you, we had to meet.

1188
01:14:05,795 --> 01:14:08,563
But here, like this,
I had not imagined.

1189
01:14:09,406 --> 01:14:12,543
Oh brother is here too,
what a surprise.

1190
01:14:12,746 --> 01:14:13,844
What is surprising in this,

1191
01:14:13,934 --> 01:14:15,737
Jasmeetís husband
will be with Jasmeet.

1192
01:14:16,012 --> 01:14:17,007
Not necessary,

1193
01:14:17,201 --> 01:14:19,883
now a dayís many husbands
are not with their wives.

1194
01:14:20,217 --> 01:14:21,256
Isnít it, Jasmeet?

1195
01:14:21,612 --> 01:14:23,374
Anyways you guys carry on.
I will see you around.

1196
01:14:24,477 --> 01:14:26,359
You guys discuss your stories,
I will be back.

1197
01:14:26,942 --> 01:14:29,698
Param, will you look
after your friend.

1198
01:14:30,034 --> 01:14:32,139
If she allows me,
then I surely will.

1199
01:14:34,401 --> 01:14:35,930
Why has he come here?

1200
01:14:36,714 --> 01:14:37,679
I like him.

1201
01:14:37,769 --> 01:14:38,709
Yuck, Alisha.

1202
01:14:38,789 --> 01:14:39,844
Chill out, enjoy your party.

1203
01:14:39,924 --> 01:14:41,006
Hi guys, see you.

1204
01:14:41,096 --> 01:14:43,708
What is all this?
Why were you not picking up my phone?

1205
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:45,185
I was sleeping.

1206
01:14:45,766 --> 01:14:46,784
Where?

1207
01:14:47,102 --> 01:14:50,327
How does it matter?
Why are you asking this question?

1208
01:14:50,648 --> 01:14:52,291
Did she do something with you?

1209
01:14:52,994 --> 01:14:54,467
Till day I have not suspected Sam.

1210
01:14:54,691 --> 01:14:57,075
Then why are you suspecting Alisha.
Very bad.

1211
01:14:57,415 --> 01:14:58,879
Donít procrastinate, answer me.

1212
01:14:59,707 --> 01:15:02,366
You are asking questions
like wives do.

1213
01:15:02,907 --> 01:15:05,188
I am your wife.

1214
01:15:06,118 --> 01:15:08,611
Oh, you remember. Congratulations.

1215
01:15:08,701 --> 01:15:10,498
I thought you must have forgotten.

1216
01:15:11,501 --> 01:15:13,956
Couldnít you find anyone else,
to be friendly.

1217
01:15:14,518 --> 01:15:16,621
She is that type of a girl.

1218
01:15:16,711 --> 01:15:19,057
What are you saying?
She is a very good girl.

1219
01:15:19,372 --> 01:15:20,490
I canít find a girl like her
in Punjab.

1220
01:15:20,634 --> 01:15:23,382
Do you know, even while staying
in London, she is a vegetarian.

1221
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:26,895
So what if she doesnít eat meat.
She eats men.

1222
01:15:28,409 --> 01:15:31,501
She has slept with half
the people present in this party.

1223
01:15:31,912 --> 01:15:33,799
You remember,
Babli from my high school.

1224
01:15:33,998 --> 01:15:35,305
She is like that.

1225
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:38,028
If someone tells her to sit,
she will lie down.

1226
01:15:39,522 --> 01:15:41,366
If people know that
she is a naughty girl,

1227
01:15:41,456 --> 01:15:42,655
why do they tell her to sit?

1228
01:15:42,745 --> 01:15:45,960
When she is back, I will tell her,
Alisha donít sit, not at all.

1229
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:47,945
Whoever says anything donít sit.
- Param,

1230
01:15:48,874 --> 01:15:52,049
I donít like you getting friendly
with her.

1231
01:15:52,129 --> 01:15:53,696
Whether you do something or not.

1232
01:15:53,945 --> 01:15:55,372
What If I say the same thing?

1233
01:16:02,648 --> 01:16:03,864
You have no answer.

1234
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:08,204
Jasmeet you enjoy the party.
And let me also.

1235
01:16:09,253 --> 01:16:10,993
Where is the bar?

1236
01:16:16,702 --> 01:16:19,513
How are you? Are you enjoying?

1237
01:16:21,252 --> 01:16:24,244
Yes I was going to. You halted me.

1238
01:16:24,324 --> 01:16:28,083
Party with Londonís high society.

1239
01:16:28,788 --> 01:16:29,998
Everyone will enjoy.

1240
01:16:30,571 --> 01:16:32,393
Especially if he comes
from such a place,

1241
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:35,284
where there is nothing
except dust and dirt.

1242
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,664
By the face, you look
as if you are made of the same mud.

1243
01:16:38,873 --> 01:16:40,852
No, I am British.

1244
01:16:41,533 --> 01:16:42,523
I was born here.

1245
01:16:43,447 --> 01:16:44,135
I have never gone to India,

1246
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:47,306
And I donít like
to be called an Indian.

1247
01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:49,322
Mr. Trishanku,

1248
01:16:50,787 --> 01:16:52,463
you donít like being
called an Indian.

1249
01:16:53,252 --> 01:16:56,149
You are dying
to be called a British.

1250
01:16:56,776 --> 01:16:59,518
But if a British man finds you
even a kilometer away,

1251
01:16:59,608 --> 01:17:02,646
he will say,
look an Indian is coming.

1252
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,893
Excuse me.

1253
01:17:05,695 --> 01:17:06,659
What did you say?

1254
01:17:16,615 --> 01:17:18,745
So you hate being called an Indian.

1255
01:17:19,858 --> 01:17:22,221
Because we litter all around.

1256
01:17:22,614 --> 01:17:25,891
Spit betel leaves.
Break traffic signals.

1257
01:17:26,907 --> 01:17:28,630
We donít like to stand in queues.

1258
01:17:29,189 --> 01:17:30,886
We take bribe and also give bribe.

1259
01:17:32,713 --> 01:17:34,846
There are more pot holes
than roads.

1260
01:17:35,816 --> 01:17:37,354
More scams than the ministers.

1261
01:17:38,422 --> 01:17:39,728
Though we are like this,

1262
01:17:43,006 --> 01:17:44,401
we are different too.

1263
01:17:46,065 --> 01:17:48,126
We have been independent
since 70 years.

1264
01:17:48,778 --> 01:17:51,171
Take any young country around us.

1265
01:17:51,902 --> 01:17:53,955
There is still a question
on their identity?

1266
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:58,377
But we make everything ourselves,
from a needle to a rocket.

1267
01:17:59,372 --> 01:18:00,874
After attempting 20 times,

1268
01:18:00,964 --> 01:18:03,782
larger countries send satellite
to mars.

1269
01:18:04,895 --> 01:18:07,804
But we in the first attempt,
at the cost of a Rickshaw,

1270
01:18:07,894 --> 01:18:09,730
have sent satellite
after satellite to mars.

1271
01:18:09,944 --> 01:18:12,443
Because we are very influential.

1272
01:18:15,544 --> 01:18:18,985
We were not like this from before.

1273
01:18:20,084 --> 01:18:21,509
We were the golden birds.

1274
01:18:21,771 --> 01:18:24,874
The Kohinoor diamond which is in
the crown, at the tower of London.

1275
01:18:24,954 --> 01:18:26,872
It is not made in Bartaniya
like you.

1276
01:18:27,326 --> 01:18:28,739
But made in India.

1277
01:18:30,711 --> 01:18:33,273
But we have not stopped
in our old glory.

1278
01:18:34,591 --> 01:18:35,752
We are progressing.

1279
01:18:37,002 --> 01:18:37,967
We are changing.

1280
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:42,283
If we develop at this speed, and
keep fighting against corruption.

1281
01:18:42,363 --> 01:18:46,125
Then, in the next 50 years,
India will develop so much that,

1282
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:48,814
Americans and Britishís will say.

1283
01:18:49,044 --> 01:18:51,227
We too want to be known as Indian.

1284
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,729
Then donít change your side,
Mr. Trishanku.

1285
01:18:58,146 --> 01:19:00,887
Be happy with what you are.

1286
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:03,008
Donít find mistakes of the country.

1287
01:19:05,168 --> 01:19:06,668
Not your identity.

1288
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:21,634
She sat down.

1289
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:24,905
Param Singh. Will you marry me?

1290
01:19:25,151 --> 01:19:26,460
What?
- What?

1291
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:27,506
What?

1292
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:28,895
Will you marry me?

1293
01:19:29,552 --> 01:19:31,309
I know it looks a bit odd. But...

1294
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:33,047
Not bit, very odd.

1295
01:19:33,573 --> 01:19:37,420
Alisha, you donít even know Param.

1296
01:19:38,115 --> 01:19:39,291
I donít care.

1297
01:19:40,137 --> 01:19:42,785
I just know the girl
who will marry Param,

1298
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:45,136
will be luckiest girl in the world.

1299
01:19:45,412 --> 01:19:47,500
Alisha, please get up.

1300
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:50,677
Your knees must be paining.
He is anyway going to refuse.

1301
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:52,435
Yes, I am going back to India.

1302
01:19:52,515 --> 01:19:55,454
I am okay.
I will go along with you.

1303
01:19:55,683 --> 01:19:57,430
But you will not be
able to settle there.

1304
01:19:57,628 --> 01:19:59,340
You will feel suffocated.

1305
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:01,149
You will be entangled
in cooking chores.

1306
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:02,295
You will feel like
going for shopping,

1307
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:03,933
and you will have
to inject a buffalo.

1308
01:20:04,023 --> 01:20:05,472
You will not at all be
able to take up a job.

1309
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:09,667
Param Singh, for you,
I will take the bull or buffalo,

1310
01:20:09,985 --> 01:20:12,497
to get injected.
- Really?

1311
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:16,424
Alisha. You get up.
He cannot marry you?

1312
01:20:16,504 --> 01:20:18,352
Why canít he?
- Why canít he?

1313
01:20:19,423 --> 01:20:21,367
Because...
- Because?

1314
01:20:21,447 --> 01:20:22,714
He is already married.

1315
01:20:23,445 --> 01:20:24,584
You are already married?

1316
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:28,689
I was once upon a time but,
as I told you earlier,

1317
01:20:28,769 --> 01:20:30,836
husbands donít live
with their wives now a days.

1318
01:20:30,916 --> 01:20:36,179
So, now a days I am single
and ready to mingle.

1319
01:20:36,259 --> 01:20:37,967
I do.

1320
01:20:42,937 --> 01:20:45,992
You were going to follow me,
here, there all around the world.

1321
01:20:46,072 --> 01:20:47,363
Which path did you take now?

1322
01:20:48,342 --> 01:20:49,561
Was I upset at the airport?

1323
01:20:50,104 --> 01:20:51,288
Then why are you? Relax.

1324
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:52,816
I...

1325
01:20:53,304 --> 01:20:54,244
Ice-cream.

1326
01:20:54,472 --> 01:20:56,288
I have not married him in real.

1327
01:20:56,872 --> 01:21:00,386
Sam was not begging on his knees.
Sam was acting.

1328
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:02,249
Now the drama is over.

1329
01:21:02,893 --> 01:21:04,220
Why isnít he giving you
the divorce?

1330
01:21:05,152 --> 01:21:07,441
The long haired guy
has started liking his role.

1331
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:09,094
He is not going
to give you divorce,

1332
01:21:09,174 --> 01:21:10,940
it is written clearly on his face.

1333
01:21:11,422 --> 01:21:12,645
Do you know why?

1334
01:21:12,765 --> 01:21:14,477
Because he has fallen
in love with you.

1335
01:21:16,201 --> 01:21:19,513
Or you know that
he has fallen for you.

1336
01:21:19,603 --> 01:21:21,303
But you are hiding from me.

1337
01:21:21,811 --> 01:21:23,150
But I donít love him.

1338
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,528
So that means he does.

1339
01:21:24,827 --> 01:21:27,196
Irrespective of whether
he does or not, I donít, Param.

1340
01:21:27,286 --> 01:21:30,352
But I also donít
love Alisha, Jasmeet.

1341
01:21:30,697 --> 01:21:33,535
Then why are you marrying her.
- The way you did.

1342
01:21:36,104 --> 01:21:38,299
I know Sam
is not going to divorce you.

1343
01:21:39,801 --> 01:21:42,126
I will marry Alisha.
We will get residency here.

1344
01:21:42,472 --> 01:21:43,814
I will divorce her
after a few days.

1345
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:46,046
We will register
our marriage again.

1346
01:21:46,126 --> 01:21:48,364
You will be a resident here.

1347
01:21:48,851 --> 01:21:52,979
In between, Alisha may fall
in love with me and get emotional.

1348
01:21:53,059 --> 01:21:55,311
Her heart might break,
she may be destroyed.

1349
01:21:55,391 --> 01:21:57,398
How does it matter to us?
Right or wrong does not matter.

1350
01:21:57,478 --> 01:21:59,369
We just have
to get settled in London.

1351
01:22:10,504 --> 01:22:12,612
Enjoy the ice-cream.

1352
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:14,877
Where are you going?

1353
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,171
I am getting married after 4 days
on the 14th.

1354
01:22:17,251 --> 01:22:19,607
I have to do lot of preparations.
Bye.

1355
01:22:25,348 --> 01:22:26,556
Param.

1356
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,464
Param.
- Leave me.

1357
01:22:30,947 --> 01:22:31,815
Param.

1358
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:45,640
Harpreet. Harp.

1359
01:22:46,148 --> 01:22:48,647
Oh, my God. Param.

1360
01:22:48,727 --> 01:22:52,386
Oh, bloody Aaru, Greetings.
- Greetings.

1361
01:22:52,476 --> 01:22:53,420
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1362
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,322
You are in London.
You did not inform me.

1363
01:22:55,412 --> 01:22:58,409
It was worth keeping it a secret.
- What?

1364
01:22:58,581 --> 01:23:01,057
I mean,
everything happened quickly.

1365
01:23:01,137 --> 01:23:03,830
You smell of Punjab.

1366
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:06,579
Still? I have also have
had a bath after coming.

1367
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:08,620
He is such a funny guy.

1368
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:12,043
We really want to chat a lot,
but I have to drop him to work.

1369
01:23:12,133 --> 01:23:13,359
So, give me your number?

1370
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:15,391
Oh, very good,
we too will come along.

1371
01:23:15,471 --> 01:23:18,979
We will chat, will gossip,
Letís see, letís go, Heathrow.

1372
01:23:32,201 --> 01:23:34,603
If you donít mind,
can I tell you something?

1373
01:23:36,861 --> 01:23:39,656
I agree no work, is big or small.

1374
01:23:39,736 --> 01:23:42,926
But you have a land in the village.

1375
01:23:43,694 --> 01:23:45,269
Then also you are doing this.

1376
01:23:47,305 --> 01:23:49,105
If an uneducated man comes here,

1377
01:23:49,997 --> 01:23:51,829
then these people wonít make him
the president directly.

1378
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:55,799
So, have to do whatever job I get.

1379
01:24:00,787 --> 01:24:05,863
Means everyone who comes to London
doesnít have a story like this.

1380
01:24:07,349 --> 01:24:09,865
Yes, maybe better than this too.

1381
01:24:10,658 --> 01:24:12,250
Or worse than this too.

1382
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:16,019
But the bad story
does not reach our country.

1383
01:24:17,014 --> 01:24:19,345
Or people like Gurnaam
donít let them reach.

1384
01:24:27,166 --> 01:24:28,018
Hello.

1385
01:24:32,809 --> 01:24:33,851
Jasmeet, letís go.

1386
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:58,451
My daughter died. My daughter died.

1387
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,898
I am doing things for them,

1388
01:25:05,759 --> 01:25:08,483
for them whom I have
never seen them alive.

1389
01:25:09,834 --> 01:25:11,665
Are you worried about yourself?

1390
01:25:20,591 --> 01:25:23,124
If you are waiting for
one more bad news from home.

1391
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:24,632
No.

1392
01:25:26,451 --> 01:25:27,666
Iqbal,

1393
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:31,945
coming to London, working hard,
earning money.

1394
01:25:33,229 --> 01:25:34,758
There is nothing wrong in that.

1395
01:25:36,558 --> 01:25:38,921
This city respects people
who work hard.

1396
01:25:41,348 --> 01:25:43,652
But someone who has come illegally,

1397
01:25:45,077 --> 01:25:46,387
there is no respect anywhere.

1398
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,781
Nowhere.

1399
01:26:13,972 --> 01:26:15,854
Iqbal brother, donít look behind.

1400
01:26:16,592 --> 01:26:18,311
A real man is the one
who after everything

1401
01:26:18,401 --> 01:26:20,143
still has the courage
to walk ahead.

1402
01:26:21,446 --> 01:26:23,796
It's home coming not a farewell.

1403
01:26:25,176 --> 01:26:26,524
What is the use of the tears?

1404
01:27:01,155 --> 01:27:03,066
Param. Hi.

1405
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:05,322
You both are so happy to meet me

1406
01:27:05,442 --> 01:27:06,741
that you forgot
to invite me inside.

1407
01:27:06,970 --> 01:27:08,214
Sorry, come in.

1408
01:27:09,511 --> 01:27:11,541
Wow, what a house?

1409
01:27:12,042 --> 01:27:14,388
Sam, after seeing your house,
I can understand why,

1410
01:27:14,468 --> 01:27:17,282
people are desperate to come
to London.

1411
01:27:17,362 --> 01:27:19,834
I thought you will be busy
preparing for your wedding.

1412
01:27:19,914 --> 01:27:22,718
I will have to come to you
for the wedding.

1413
01:27:23,254 --> 01:27:24,390
Donít tell me,
she is the number one

1414
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,452
wedding planner of your village.

1415
01:27:25,882 --> 01:27:29,863
No, she played a very
important role in my first wedding.

1416
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:31,635
So, it must be for the second too.

1417
01:27:33,222 --> 01:27:36,810
I want my second wedding should be
as challenging as the first one.

1418
01:27:37,027 --> 01:27:37,778
What?

1419
01:27:37,868 --> 01:27:38,962
Can I sit?

1420
01:27:41,146 --> 01:27:42,711
You too sit, itís your own house.
You forgot?

1421
01:27:43,286 --> 01:27:44,172
Jasmeet.

1422
01:27:44,262 --> 01:27:45,843
Yes, Jasmeet sit.

1423
01:27:47,632 --> 01:27:49,136
Jasmeet, you remember my wedding.

1424
01:27:50,551 --> 01:27:52,833
The most beautiful day of my life.

1425
01:27:54,065 --> 01:27:57,692
The girl whom I loved 100%,
I was going to marry her.

1426
01:27:59,795 --> 01:28:01,605
I remember,
she was looking so beautiful.

1427
01:28:02,357 --> 01:28:03,658
Hold on, let me get this right.

1428
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:06,995
You want, your second marriage,

1429
01:28:07,535 --> 01:28:09,359
to remind you
of your first wedding?

1430
01:28:10,065 --> 01:28:11,665
My tomorrow is also a part of me.

1431
01:28:13,179 --> 01:28:16,226
Wherever I am today,
is because of tomorrow.

1432
01:28:17,222 --> 01:28:18,983
And I never want to forget that.

1433
01:28:20,973 --> 01:28:23,018
I want Alisha to look exactly
like my first bride.

1434
01:28:23,374 --> 01:28:25,093
Make her wear the same clothes.

1435
01:28:25,839 --> 01:28:27,313
The same ambience,
the same atmosphere.

1436
01:28:27,623 --> 01:28:29,123
The same invitation card.

1437
01:28:29,461 --> 01:28:32,991
The same feast.
Everything same to same.

1438
01:28:33,352 --> 01:28:34,890
You must have
remembered everything.

1439
01:28:36,726 --> 01:28:39,977
Sam, wonít you offer
a drink to Param.

1440
01:28:40,638 --> 01:28:41,992
Yes, of course. What will you have?

1441
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:44,599
Bring anything,
you have good taste.

1442
01:28:49,956 --> 01:28:51,872
If itís a drama,
then why all these preparations?

1443
01:28:53,405 --> 01:28:56,516
If it's drama, then why so much pain
in arranging all this.

1444
01:28:58,141 --> 01:28:59,017
Here you go.

1445
01:28:59,244 --> 01:29:00,550
Thank you.

1446
01:29:01,785 --> 01:29:03,158
Cheers.
- Cheers to a happy married life

1447
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:04,874
and this one being the last.

1448
01:29:10,336 --> 01:29:11,785
Okay, I am leaving.

1449
01:29:11,875 --> 01:29:13,899
Jasmeet, I will see you tomorrow.
Done.

1450
01:29:15,027 --> 01:29:16,478
Take care.
- Take care. See you, man.

1451
01:29:21,525 --> 01:29:25,049
Do you know Alisha, I did not wear
a suit on my first wedding.

1452
01:29:25,545 --> 01:29:27,195
God has fulfilled that desire.

1453
01:29:29,558 --> 01:29:31,973
Jasmeet, we will take black suit.

1454
01:29:32,195 --> 01:29:35,482
If she sees him in a suit then
will not divorce him for 7 years.

1455
01:29:36,347 --> 01:29:38,193
Silver, letís buy a silver one.

1456
01:29:38,273 --> 01:29:40,769
I want to like a groom
not a pomfret fish.

1457
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:42,917
If you donít approve of my choice,
then why did you call me?

1458
01:29:43,126 --> 01:29:45,453
But I want my groom in black.

1459
01:29:45,533 --> 01:29:46,628
Oh.

1460
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:48,845
You have got your groom in black.

1461
01:29:49,094 --> 01:29:51,908
This connection is called black.
Isnít it, Jasmeet?

1462
01:29:52,164 --> 01:29:53,951
Itís your wedding you should know.

1463
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:57,067
You must have had the experience.

1464
01:29:58,044 --> 01:30:01,025
I am buying a silver suit.
Donít waste my time by chatting.

1465
01:30:02,098 --> 01:30:04,839
Should I buy black shoes or
wear golden and become a mermaid.

1466
01:30:05,211 --> 01:30:06,311
Mermaid?

1467
01:30:06,563 --> 01:30:08,227
Mermaid baby.

1468
01:30:08,931 --> 01:30:11,621
You are so sweet.
- That I am.

1469
01:30:12,563 --> 01:30:14,383
You have to give me
a discount please.

1470
01:30:14,473 --> 01:30:15,662
Itís already discounted.

1471
01:30:15,752 --> 01:30:18,920
She is asking for a discount
on her husbandís wedding suit.

1472
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:21,991
She is looking nice.

1473
01:30:23,753 --> 01:30:25,313
But not like you.

1474
01:30:25,786 --> 01:30:29,218
No. 8 on 10.

1475
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:34,324
Is she your friend?

1476
01:30:34,608 --> 01:30:36,339
That you are rating her.
8 out of 10.

1477
01:30:36,419 --> 01:30:37,765
She is your rival.

1478
01:30:37,994 --> 01:30:40,009
What are you laughing for?
If you were a real Punjabi,

1479
01:30:40,099 --> 01:30:41,368
you would have jumped
on her by now.

1480
01:30:41,448 --> 01:30:43,250
Fighting with her,
pulling her hair.

1481
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:45,832
Tore her clothes. You are laughing?
- What happened?

1482
01:30:46,628 --> 01:30:47,994
Am I looking stupid?

1483
01:30:48,574 --> 01:30:49,887
No, not at all,

1484
01:30:50,109 --> 01:30:52,066
he keeps making me laugh
all the time.

1485
01:30:53,893 --> 01:30:55,259
She has gone in flash back.

1486
01:30:56,650 --> 01:30:58,204
Alisha, you look very pretty.

1487
01:30:58,294 --> 01:31:01,818
If my first wife was here
she would have given you 8 on 10.

1488
01:31:05,992 --> 01:31:07,505
Baby.
- Come, baby.

1489
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:08,320
Thank you.

1490
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:11,916
Actually not 8 out of 10,
you should get 10 on 10.

1491
01:31:22,413 --> 01:31:23,552
No, she isnít laughing.

1492
01:31:25,494 --> 01:31:27,843
But she isnít wrestling also.

1493
01:31:33,591 --> 01:31:34,578
This is good.

1494
01:31:34,834 --> 01:31:37,803
The card should be simple
at the second wedding.

1495
01:31:37,883 --> 01:31:39,873
Jasmeet, itís my first marriage.

1496
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:42,047
Yes.

1497
01:31:43,927 --> 01:31:49,041
The card should be exactly the way
it was on our first wedding.

1498
01:31:50,749 --> 01:31:52,813
I mean my first wedding.

1499
01:31:54,521 --> 01:31:57,386
You had made me write an oath
on that card, Jasmeet.

1500
01:32:00,024 --> 01:32:01,212
Do you remember the oath?

1501
01:32:02,921 --> 01:32:05,494
My husband,
my groom lives immortally.

1502
01:32:09,007 --> 01:32:13,052
Never ending.

1503
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:15,766
Never dying.

1504
01:32:18,004 --> 01:32:19,279
Beautiful.

1505
01:32:20,922 --> 01:32:22,321
What does that mean Jasmeet?

1506
01:32:24,997 --> 01:32:26,423
She just remembers the words.

1507
01:32:27,052 --> 01:32:28,953
She has forgotten
the meaning long ago.

1508
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:35,678
My husband,
my groom lives immortally.

1509
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:41,158
Never ending. Never dying.

1510
01:32:43,503 --> 01:32:45,090
The one who never abandons me.

1511
01:32:58,605 --> 01:33:00,018
Jasmeet.
- Sam.

1512
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:03,742
I can understand everything
that you are trying to do.

1513
01:33:04,346 --> 01:33:06,643
You think I am a simpleton
from some village

1514
01:33:06,723 --> 01:33:10,110
whom you will not give residency
and I will keep tolerating quietly.

1515
01:33:10,356 --> 01:33:12,335
And finally I will have
to obey you.

1516
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:15,937
You will get residency tomorrow.

1517
01:33:19,967 --> 01:33:21,345
There is an interview
at the home department.

1518
01:33:21,784 --> 01:33:24,052
After that you can stay here
as long as you want.

1519
01:33:24,778 --> 01:33:25,701
Alone.

1520
01:33:28,723 --> 01:33:30,577
Can I give you the flowers
and open champagne,

1521
01:33:30,667 --> 01:33:32,071
or you still want to scold me?

1522
01:33:34,647 --> 01:33:37,329
No, I want to make a call.

1523
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:44,039
'Oh, west minister abbey.'

1524
01:33:44,592 --> 01:33:45,622
'Should I tell you something?'

1525
01:33:45,712 --> 01:33:47,210
'Whenever I see this place,'

1526
01:33:47,403 --> 01:33:50,008
'I feel like going to London
and seeing this place with you.'

1527
01:33:54,851 --> 01:33:59,100
'The place where 2 real lovers
walk hand in hand.'

1528
01:34:13,758 --> 01:34:15,422
And now may I kiss the bride.

1529
01:34:33,985 --> 01:34:35,382
Param, stop this wedding.

1530
01:34:36,828 --> 01:34:38,686
I am getting
the residency tomorrow.

1531
01:34:39,811 --> 01:34:41,669
Now there is no need of this drama.

1532
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:48,767
Whether others understand or not,
I thought you would understand.

1533
01:34:48,847 --> 01:34:50,666
Why I am marrying, Jasmeet.

1534
01:34:51,834 --> 01:34:53,837
Param, the destination is very near.

1535
01:34:55,369 --> 01:34:56,439
Please, wait till tomorrow.

1536
01:34:59,239 --> 01:35:03,575
To harm each other today, thinking
that tomorrow will be better.

1537
01:35:07,294 --> 01:35:10,333
There canít be anything more stupid
in than this in the world, Jasmeet.

1538
01:35:10,569 --> 01:35:13,333
It canít be.
- "The heart is stubborn."

1539
01:35:14,597 --> 01:35:15,693
I am married.

1540
01:35:17,513 --> 01:35:20,809
Param and me.

1541
01:35:21,447 --> 01:35:22,639
I knew it.

1542
01:35:25,393 --> 01:35:26,542
Because if you weren't married,

1543
01:35:27,891 --> 01:35:29,599
then you could not have resisted
my charm.

1544
01:35:31,966 --> 01:35:33,264
Go, go to him.

1545
01:35:46,918 --> 01:35:49,076
Excuse me. Where is the wedding?

1546
01:35:50,595 --> 01:35:51,777
My wedding.

1547
01:35:55,741 --> 01:35:57,987
Did you really think,
Param would do something like this?

1548
01:35:59,882 --> 01:36:01,468
I know he is your husband.

1549
01:36:02,735 --> 01:36:05,740
He told me the day I met him.

1550
01:36:07,859 --> 01:36:09,366
Param can be duped,

1551
01:36:11,211 --> 01:36:12,372
but he canít dupe.

1552
01:36:13,048 --> 01:36:14,592
'I will fulfill my promise Alisha.'

1553
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:19,282
'I will just do the ceremony
but not the vows.'

1554
01:36:19,609 --> 01:36:21,197
'I will not be able to say them.'

1555
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:25,824
'Because my heart and life
is somewhere else.'

1556
01:36:27,103 --> 01:36:31,305
'Who will take second hand love
from such a loving person?'

1557
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:36,822
'Go, you are hers for 7 lives.'

1558
01:36:37,752 --> 01:36:40,650
'Then itís my chance. Promise.'

1559
01:36:41,665 --> 01:36:43,136
'And I will not let you break it
this time.'

1560
01:36:45,547 --> 01:36:46,865
'Thank you.'

1561
01:37:14,941 --> 01:37:17,848
'I never thought that one day
the city will win and I will lose.'

1562
01:37:18,790 --> 01:37:20,423
'But I was wrong.'

1563
01:37:21,805 --> 01:37:23,107
'I made one more mistake.'

1564
01:37:24,064 --> 01:37:25,538
'To come here illegally.'

1565
01:37:26,464 --> 01:37:28,377
'I am going to rectify
that Jasmeet.'

1566
01:37:29,458 --> 01:37:32,280
'I am going to Indian Embassy
and getting myself deported.'

1567
01:37:43,459 --> 01:37:44,380
Param.

1568
01:37:46,583 --> 01:37:49,074
Param, you havenít lost.
You never lost.

1569
01:37:49,795 --> 01:37:51,704
The minute I saw you, I realized

1570
01:37:51,794 --> 01:37:55,253
that I have made such a big mistake
of coming to London like this.

1571
01:37:56,096 --> 01:37:59,614
To cover up that mistake
I kept making more mistakes.

1572
01:37:59,704 --> 01:38:02,296
I felt when everything
will become alright,

1573
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:04,056
we will forget all this.

1574
01:38:05,609 --> 01:38:06,767
But...

1575
01:38:08,258 --> 01:38:10,199
But I was cracking from inside.

1576
01:38:12,074 --> 01:38:16,403
I cannot forget that
I am doing so wrong with you.

1577
01:38:17,652 --> 01:38:20,128
I was doing so wrong
to Sam and Alisha.

1578
01:38:20,841 --> 01:38:24,279
The country whose praises
I was happy to hear.

1579
01:38:25,241 --> 01:38:27,052
I was doing so wrong with it.

1580
01:38:30,170 --> 01:38:31,547
Param, I have realized.

1581
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:35,803
London is very nice.

1582
01:38:36,733 --> 01:38:40,937
But now London has
no meaning for me.

1583
01:38:43,824 --> 01:38:45,600
I want my, Param.

1584
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,170
I have understood

1585
01:38:50,613 --> 01:38:53,792
which city we live,
it makes no difference.

1586
01:38:55,553 --> 01:39:00,058
With whom we live,
and how much he loves us.

1587
01:39:00,885 --> 01:39:02,859
Only that matters.

1588
01:39:10,041 --> 01:39:11,727
What was the need to go so long.

1589
01:39:13,123 --> 01:39:14,572
You could have just hugged me
and said sorry.

1590
01:39:16,658 --> 01:39:17,549
You know that.

1591
01:39:18,009 --> 01:39:20,626
When you hug me,

1592
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:25,020
so many naughty, naughty thoughts
run in my mind, girl.

1593
01:39:25,858 --> 01:39:27,422
Come into my arms.

1594
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:34,363
'Girl, get ready.'

1595
01:39:35,047 --> 01:39:37,303
'We have a bigger war
to fight in Punjab.'

1596
01:39:38,095 --> 01:39:40,114
'We will fulfill your first dream.'

1597
01:39:41,674 --> 01:39:45,544
'I promise you,
I will surely convince grandfather.'
