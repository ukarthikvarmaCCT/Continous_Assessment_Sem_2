1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,680
You are Sundar, the sweets maker.
You are not Shabari,

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,680
whose half-eaten berries were
eaten by Lord Ram.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,760
And even if Lord Ram comes here,
he will not eat these 'laddus.'

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,480
Why? Have I made a mistake?

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,240
Mistake? How did you
forget to add almonds,

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,560
in the 'laddus' that are going to
be offered to Lord Ram?

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,600
She hasn't even
tasted the 'laddus' yet.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,960
How does she know that
there are no almonds in them?

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,080
From experience.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,160
Stop whispering to each other.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,680
As you already know,

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,880
that my ears, nose and eyes
are sharper than your brains.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,680
I've crossed 75 years.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,880
But I don't have any sickness, not
even in the nail of my last toe.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,800
I don't have any issues with BP,
Cholesterol or Sugar.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,720
My eyesight is as sharp as an eagle
and speed as fast as a cheetah.

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,920
And my clasp is so strong that
you won't be able to free yourself.

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,280
Janki Maa, only 10 minutes are
left in offering the sweets to God.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,720
How will I prepare a new batch
of 'laddus' in 10 minutes?

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,280
You won't be able to make them.

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,320
I will make them.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,680
I'll call Jyoti to help...

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,720
These old bones
are still strong enough

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,360
to prepare a feast for 100 people.

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,520
Grandma, your time starts now.

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,280
[harmonium playing]

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,840
Grandma.

[song playing]

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,240
"Ram will come"

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,560
There's still one minute left.

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,160
Starting today,

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,600
we will not get sweets for
Lord Ram, from your shop.

33
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,520
Janki Maa, please
give me one chance.

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
This is the first time
I've made a mistake.

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,600
The punishment has been given

36
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,040
to ensure that your
first mistake is the last.

37
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,360
If forgiveness is given,

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,240
making mistakes becomes a habit.

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,880
'Three things in Ujjain have
not changed in all these years.'

40
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,800
'The cry of devotion
for Lord Mahakal.'

41
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,920
'Janki Maa's character.'

42
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,360
'And the identity of this
house with the henna plant'

43
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,040
'That's me, Mehendi.'

44
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,160
'There was a time'

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,880
'when all the relationships
were adorned with my fragrance.'

46
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,400
'Every day was like
the festival of spring.'

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,600
'But then, it was shadowed
by the autumn season.'

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,080
'After many years, I'm
going on a new journey.'

49
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,800
'From Ujjain that sits on
the banks of River Shipra'

50
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,760
'to Mumbai, that dwells
by the ocean side.'

51
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,480
'I hope to bring back
colour into the lost relationships.'

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,920
'I don't know why,
but my heart says, '

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,360
'this girl will make
my hopes come true.'

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,680
'Yes, this girl.'

55
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,800
'The one who adorns her
hands with the colour of her love.'

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,880
Make sure to apply it well, Neha.

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
This 'mehendi' has the name
of my son, Manas, written on it.

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,960
- The colour should be intense.
- Yes.

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,880
Mauli, why are you crying?

[mellow music]

62
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,000
You've lived in this house
since you were a child.

63
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,280
And you have to live here
even after you get married.

64
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,800
Have you not heard
about tears of happiness?

65

[vocalisation]

66
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,280
After Mom and Dad passed away,

67
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,920
I had become an orphan.

68
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,400
When I was a child, I craved

69
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,240
for someone,

70
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,040
whom I could call as Dad,

71
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,960
whom I could call Mom.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,880
I wanted to have my own family.

73
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,000
When we don't have certain
relationships in our fate,

74
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,760
we look for them all our life, Neha.

75
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,920
Today...

76
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,920
Today, I'm being
blessed with everything.

77
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,240
[sighing deeply]

78
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,760
That is why I'm very happy.

79
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,120
Don't shed so many
tears of happiness,

80
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,320
that it dulls the colour
of your 'mehendi.'

00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,640
[shehnai playing]

82
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,080
Congratulations, Dr. Manoj.

83
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,720
You've found the
perfect wife for Manas.

84
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,760
Thank you.

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,720
Manas. Come!

88
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,880
Get your pictures clicked. Everyone
should know you're getting married.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,200
Just two minutes, Mom.

[giggling]

91
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,520
If you had told me this yesterday,
before I got married...

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
It wouldn't have
been so tough for me.

93
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,320
It's tough. But I have to do it.

94
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,960
I will make everything
right. Trust me.

96
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Mauli, what happened?

97
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,320
You're looking so tense
on your wedding day.

98
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,920
It's not written on your
prescription or my wedding card,

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,800
that you can forget

100
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,640
to take your medicines
on my wedding day.

101
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,440
You ask patients in the hospital
every day about their medicines.

102
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,000
But you always forget to take
your medicines.

103
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,600
Here you go.

104
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
You're trying to be my
doctor, aren't you?

105
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,400
No. I'm exercising
my right as a daughter.

106
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,000
Honestly, Mauli, whatever
you have done for me till today,

107
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,160
even my own daughter
would not have done so much.

108
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,480
What, Uncle? Is this
your love and friendship?

109
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,560
You're making me feel
like an outsider now.

110
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,200
Do you consider me as your own?

111
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,280
Then, don't call me Uncle.
Practice calling me Dad.

112
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,440
Yes, Dad.

Even if I used a surgical light,

let alone a lamp,

117
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,080
I would not find a
better partner for my son.

118
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,280
Go on, now.

119
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,920
One second. This is for you.

'Did you see that?
Manoj recognised it immediately.'

'It brought back long
lost memories in his mind.'

when his sister got married.'

'The entire family, '

125
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,080
'had a lot of fond memories
of the wedding.'

126
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,680
What do you mean you
want to break this marriage?

127
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,880
Manas, are you playing a joke on me
or making a fool of me?

128
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,160
I thought everything between
Ashna and I was finished.

129
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,240
But it's not over.

130
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,960
That is why I'm
taking this decision.

131
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,960
Manas, we were the
ones who got married.

132
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,440
How can you take
the decision all alone?

133
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,920
Because I cannot continue
this marriage with you.

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,040
Ashna is back in my life.
And I love her.

135
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,120
I'm going to her
for a couple of days.

136
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,760
Then, I will plan what to do next.

Manas!

141
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,360
How can you be so selfish?

142
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,400
She's better than
you in every aspect.

143
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,120
She's a doctor, which
you could never become.

144
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,560
She's kind-hearted.
She's beautiful.

145
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,640
She was ready to marry you,
just because I asked her to.

146
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,840
Dad, I can never be
what Mauli is to you.

147
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,200
You wanted me to
become a doctor. I failed.

148
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,960
But Mauli became a doctor.

149
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,480
An outsider became closer to
your heart than your own son.

150
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,840
Manas, decisions made
in haste are usually wrong.

151
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,360
Please, Mauli. It's better
if you stay out of this.

152
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,440
You know that I did
not want to marry you.

153
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,720
- Dad forced me...
- No, Manas.

154
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,440
You were not forced.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,480
You were asked about it.
And you had agreed.

156
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,760
Yes, I agree.

157
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,720
But Ashna is back in my life.
I will, naturally, go back to her.

158
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Manas.

159
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Manas, please think
with a calm mind.

160
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,080
- Please.
- Mom, at least you understand.

161
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,080
I cannot live with Mauli and torture
myself for the rest of my life.

162
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,360
There ends the matter.

163
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,040
Then let's finish this
once and for all, Manas.

164
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,720
You don't want anything
to do with Mauli, right?

165
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
I also don't want
anything to do with you.

166
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,560
There is no place
for him in this house.

167
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,600
Okay, fine. You can live with
your daughter in this happy family.

168
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,760
I'll fend for myself.

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,720
I've made a mistake
and I'm apologising for it.

170
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,120
But I cannot pay the price for
my mistake for the rest of my life.

171
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,840
[dramatic music]

172
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,720
Manas. Remember this.

173
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,800
Once you leave the house,

174
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,080
then it becomes

What have you done, Manoj?

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,360
You forced my son to
leave his own house and go.

180
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,880
He was apologising.

181
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,880
You also made the same
mistake when you were young.

You are the one who
has to be brave, Mauli.

00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,520
You were eight years old.

210
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
When your parents
died in an accident.

211
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,880
Manoj brought you home
and gave you a family.

212
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,920
He brought you up like his own.

213
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,160
Otherwise, you would
have remained an orphan.

214
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,080
He gave you a good education.

215
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,920
He made you a doctor.

216
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,360
Now it's your turn to
do something for Manoj.

217
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,120
You got married because
Manoj asked you to, right?

218

You've not lost anything.

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,720
You are like how you were before.

220
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,040
Manas left you on
your wedding night.

221
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,600
He has not even touched you.

222
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,800
So, please...

223
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,560
Don't make a big issue
that Manas has left you.

224
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,040
Because the more
fuel you add to this fire,

225
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
the longer it will take for
Manoj to recover.

- Mauli. - There is
a lot of damage to his heart.

happen to Dad.

And managing your
husband is another thing.

She was an orphan.

She had dreams of
having her own family.

nor could she have a family.

Ajar Hospital is the

I know about what
happened in your personal life.

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,560
Will you be able to do it?

285

200% commitment.

Yes, sir.

But...

00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,240
This job means a lot to me.

Before you sign the papers,

295
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,760
I want you to think it through.

296
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,000
It's an exclusive contract.

297
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,760
Once you sign this, you
cannot work anywhere else.

298
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,840
Nor can you get out of it.

299
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,280
There is no looking back.

300
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,200
And for some reason,
if you change your mind

301
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,280
or if there is a breach of contract,

302
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,480
then you will have to
face legal consequences.

303
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,920
There can be a ban on
your medical practice.

304
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
You have four days to join the job.

305
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,360
Sign this only if you're
fully prepared for the job.

I've thought about it, sir.
My dream is coming true.

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,560
I will not step back.

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,440
Welcome to Ajar's.

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,320
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

Dad, you've performed
so many surgeries.

314
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,160
Have you ever seen a patient smile,

315
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,880
while under anaesthesia?
I have seen it.

316
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,000
- Who is it?
- You.

When this leaf fell on you

318
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,880
you opened your eyes.

319
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,520
I know where this came from.

320
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,840
Where from?

321
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,920
From my childhood.

322
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,960
From my 'house of mehendi.'

323
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,400
'House of mehendi?'

324
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,960
Everyone who passed
by on our street, in Ujjain

325
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,880
they would automatically

326
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,360
bow down in front of

327
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,320
the idols of Ram and Sita.

328
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,920
It was not just a house,
but it was a temple.

329
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,280
Where we four brothers,

330
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,000
lived like Ram, Lakshman, Bharat

331
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,520
and Shatrughna.

332
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,760
The eldest among us is Ajay.

333
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,280
He is a devotee of Lord Hanuman.

334
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,600
He would lift a
mountain with one hand.

335
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,040
But he is extremely emotional.

336
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,320
The water would flow in the tap

337
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,960
only after water would
begin flowing from his eyes.

and then my brother.

'Here you go, Mannu.'

00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,120
'Why? Am I not the youngest?'

346
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,680
- 'Huh?
- Come on.'

347
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,480
'If Mannu wouldn't have come before
you, then how would you come?'

348
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,600
'Hmm.'

349
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,200
As dear as my brothers
Ajay and Vijay were to me,

350
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,680
even their wives
were very dear to me.

351
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,720

00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,840
was our only sister, Manisha.

355
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,960
Just like a magician's
soul is inside a parrot,

356
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,360
all our souls resided
inside Manisha.

357
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,520
'Oh, wow. There is
no need for make-up.'

358
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,000
'There is such a wonderful
glow on her face.'

359
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,320
'Don't make these funny faces.
You're not yet married.'

360
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,240
'Then your husband
will not take you with him.'

361
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,000
We were so happy
when she got married.

362
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,000
A big family with
a lot of happiness.

363
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,440
Do you know who was the head
of the department of our family?

364
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,240
My father's elder brother.

365
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,040
He had just Rs. 10 in his pocket
when he first came to Ujjain.

366
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,280
He was courageous and hard-working.

367
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,800
And he purchased a big shop.

368
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,080
'Agarwal Saree Emporium.'

369
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,280
He used to love everyone a lot.

370
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,240
But I was his favourite child.

371
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,680
I don't know how he must be today.

372
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,640
Our Mannu.

373
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,600
Nanhe, come and have a look.

374
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,400
My dad is referred to as 'Nanhe.'

375
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,040
He never disobeyed
anything that my Uncle said.

376
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,240
No.

377
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,440
I will not do as you say.

378
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,000
I don't want to see any photos.

379
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,560
Don't see Manoj's photos.

380
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,920
His son is getting married.

381
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,640
You can see those
photos and be happy.

382
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,560
Hari, when we see the photos
of our family members on the phone,

383
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,280
then it does not bring happiness.
It breaks our hearts.

384
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
Nanhe.

385
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,600
Why are you still holding on to
the bitter memories of the past?

386
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,880
My heart is not as
big as yours, Hari.

387
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,120
I won't be able to forget
how he cheated us.

388
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,840
He could have at least

389
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,440
thought about Janki Maa,

390
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,160
who looked after him,

391
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,800
after his mother passed away.

392
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,040
Janki Maa.

393
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,560
My Aunt.

394
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,520
There is no greater
medicine than her scolding.

395
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,960
She's the backbone of our house.

396
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,320
The entire household
runs on her shoulders.

397
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,040
The tea has turned into cold juice.

398
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,800
Please drink it. If you ask
me to heat it once again,

399
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,440
then I will heat it
and pour it over your phone.

400
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,480
[mellow music]

401
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,520
Dad, this letter.

402
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,800
Read what has been written.

403
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,360
'You must be worried'

404
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,440
'that everything was
scattered after you left.'

405
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,040
'But I'm happy to let you know'

406
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,480
'that nothing like that happened.'

407
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,080
'Everything worked out well.'

408
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
'The Earth, the Moon, the Sun, '

409
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,000
'all of these are
revolving as they were, '

410
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,440
'before you cheated us.'

411
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,440
'It did not make any difference.'

412
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,080
Read the rest, Mauli.

413
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,720
'Mini is getting married.'

414
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,160
'And we are having
a grand wedding.'

415
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,880
'I thought I should send you this
invitation on this joyous occasion.'

416
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,920
'Please don't think
that we are inviting you.'

417
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,360
'This is proof of the defeat'

418
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,160
'of your stubbornness
and arrogance.'

419
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,000
'Akshay, a stranger.'

420
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,880
Are you looking for something?

421
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,520
I sent Mini's wedding invitation

422
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,080
to Mumbai by courier.

423
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,160
Its receipt has fallen somewhere.

424
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,480
I'm not finding it at all.

425
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,760
[suspenseful music]

426
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,160
Oh, God. What if Janki Maa finds it?

427
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,320
I found it.

428
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,320
[dramatic music]

429
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,600
[metal clanking]

430
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,520
Nothing stays hidden
from Janki's eyes.

431
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,360
Akshay, Janki Maa, Dad

432
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,640
are all bitter because
of my mistake.

433
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,600
[flute playing]

434
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,360
You are suffering

435
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,920
the results of my deeds.

436
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,480
No, Dad. Please don't
blame yourself.

437
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,680
No, Mauli.

438
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,880
As long as I don't
rectify my mistakes,

439
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,160
I won't be able to
improve your life.

440
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,240
I must go back to my
'House of mehendi.'

441
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,400
I will fall at Janki Maa's feet
and ask for forgiveness.

442
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,960
I don't have the courage
to go alone.

443
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,800
Will you come along with me?

444
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,600
'This is not an easy
decision for Mauli to make.'

445
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,720
'This job is not just
helping Mauli balance her life, '

446
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,320
'but it is also her dream.'

447
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,520
'But on the other hand'

448
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,400
'Manoj's purpose in life
is to go to Ujjain, '

449
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,760
'and ask for forgiveness
from his family.'

450
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,200
'What will Mauli choose between her
Dad like Manoj's purpose in life'

451
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,120
'and her dream job?'
