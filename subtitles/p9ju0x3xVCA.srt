00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,128
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,128 --> 00:00:03,192
10 Million subscribers.

3
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:04,508
1 Crore people.

4
00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:06,817
It's such an unbelievable number

5
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:09,953
it's more than the population of countries like Switzerland or Norway.

6
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:13,056
First of all, a heartfelt thank you to all of you.

7
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:16,722
You made it possible,
you took us to this milestone.

8
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:20,413
Secondly, I decided to do something special for this occasion.

9
00:00:20,413 --> 00:00:24,197
In the history videos, we discussed several historical events.

10
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:27,482
So I decided to take you into my past.

11
00:00:27,482 --> 00:00:32,128
I wanted to show you my childhood videos,
and tell you stories from my childhood,

12
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:34,664
those that I have never shared before.

13
00:00:34,664 --> 00:00:37,518
Come, in this video, let me take you on a journey,

14
00:00:37,518 --> 00:00:39,436
into my life.

15
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:43,930
This story begins in October 1994.

16
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,568
I was born in Rohtak, Haryana

17
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:48,358
to a small, middle-class family.

18
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:51,531
My parents were quite young, about 24-25 years old.

19
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:53,781
My mother was a teacher,

20
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:55,532
and my father was an engineer.

21
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:58,678
Together, they earned about ₹4,000 per month.

22
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:01,134
There weren't many videos back then,

23
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:03,459
because video cameras were rare then.

24
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:05,330
There are some photos like these,

25
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,176
but I hid my parents' faces for privacy.

26
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:10,545
Friends, in my childhood, I got to travel a lot.

27
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:12,646
Though I don't remember any of it,

28
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:15,128
because I was a weaning infant.

29
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:17,648
But there are several photos

30
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:20,544
from the snow in Srinagar 
to Jaisalmer's desert.

31
00:01:20,544 --> 00:01:24,689
This is because my maternal grandfather worked in BSF.

32
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,040
You'd know that if a family member works in the army,

33
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,743
they are frequently posted in numerous places.

34
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:32,226
All across India.

35
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:36,057
This is why when my parents would go to meet my maternal grandparents,

36
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:38,727
they got to visit all these places.

37
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:41,606
Of course, I do not remember the first few years

38
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:44,420
My earliest memories are from Rohtak.

39
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,453
Playing in Rohtak's lake,

40
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:48,743
and playing at my paternal grandparents' home.

41
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:51,967
Some years later, my parents moved to Delhi

42
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,537
for better job opportunities.

43
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:56,717
My father was offered a better job at a better salary.

44
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,887
They told me that around 2002-2003,

45
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:03,059
their salary was around ₹17,000 per month.

46
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:05,979
There was a big turning point in life in 2003,

47
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:10,568
when my father was offered an even better job in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

48
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:13,491
And so he moved to Malaysia.

49
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:17,323
But my mother, my brother, and I didn't go there,

50
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:19,851
because though the salary offered was a lot,

51
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:22,753
but it wasn't enough for the entire family

52
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:25,035
with the increased living expenses,

53
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:26,600
it would've cancelled out the salary boost.

54
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,297
So we lived in Delhi, but once a year, we went to Malaysia.

55
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:32,635
So during the summer vacation,

56
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:35,467
I got the opportunity to visit abroad for the first time.

57
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:37,407
That was my first foreign trip.

58
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,980
We lived there for 1 month during the summer of 2003.

59
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,801
There were new experiences in the new country.

60
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:48,567
I remember eating a waffle with maple syrup for the first time.

61
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:49,760
I loved it.

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,689
And this was the first time I got to play with Lego.

63
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:57,018
Lego had a large impact on my life,

64
00:02:57,018 --> 00:02:58,946
as you'd see later in this story.

65
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:03,181
But it was in Malaysia that our family bought our first digital camera.

66
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:06,090
So there are some videos from then.

67
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,489
Like any other 8-9 year old child,

68
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,104
I had a lot of free time.

69
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,978
And friends, this was when I made my first video.  

70
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,461
Yup, that's right.

71
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:34,403
The first video was in 2003.

72
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:37,149
The thing is that we had a computer,

73
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:40,417
and we recently bought a new webcam for the computer.

74
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:44,023
You'd recall that the internet was very slow back then.

75
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:48,849
When my parents wanted to talk to each other from Malaysia to India,

76
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:51,410
they used Yahoo! Messenger.

77
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,143
The dial-up internet.

78
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:56,734
Video calling was a recent addition to it,

79
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:58,709
you could see the person you were talking to.

80
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,617
Though the internet was so slow,

81
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:02,893
that the video was heavily pixelated.

82
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:05,751
I don't know what was the resolution of the webcams back then,

83
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:07,775
perhaps it was around 240p.

84
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:10,076
But I learned one thing from this webcam,

85
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:11,697
perhaps my father taught me,

86
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:13,803
you could click on it and capture photos.

87
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:14,898
There was a button.

88
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:19,099
I learned that if 24 photos were placed one after another,

89
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:20,916
and played them successively,

90
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,625
it could create a video of 1 second.

91
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,084
I learned about the concept of frame rates.

92
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:28,125
What is 24fps?

93
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,381
Basically, in a 1-second long video, there are 24 photos.

94
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:33,713
This was a mindblowing fact for my young mind.

95
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:37,715
Because I realised that I could create animated films.

96
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:40,490
You remember playing with clay, right?

97
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,628
I created characters with that clay,

98
00:04:42,628 --> 00:04:45,459
and kept a white sheet as a background

99
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,997
and used the webcam to take a photo.

100
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:51,035
I moved the clay character a bit and took another photo.

101
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:52,883
Move a bit more, and took another photo.

102
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:56,400
And eventually, I took about 50-60 photos,

103
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,192
And created a 1-2 second long video.

104
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:01,496
In which these clay characters were seemingly moving on their own.

105
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:03,439
This is known as Claymation.

106
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,480
The video was like this.

107
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,744
You weren't expecting much, were you?

108
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,639
I was a child of 8-9 years.

109
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,042
What more could you expect?

110
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:18,612
Like other kids of that time, I enjoyed reading comics.

111
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:20,374
Specially Tinkle comics.

112
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:21,674
That was my favourite.

113
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:26,421
Of course, I enjoyed watching cartoons on TV back then.

114
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:30,725
"Mowgli is eating a banana here."

115
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:35,122
"Oh, no! Someone is setting the tail on fire."

116
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:37,547
"Oh! It is Mowgli."

117
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:38,787
"Who else could it be?"

118
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:41,380
Popeye was my favourite cartoon back then.

119
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,946
I'd say that my obsession with eating healthy stems from here.

120
00:05:44,946 --> 00:05:47,650
One should always have spinach and other vegetables.

121
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,158
It's unfortunate that the cartoons presented to children nowadays

122
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:53,898
often, unhealthy food is promoted in them.

123
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:56,395
A cartoon promoting laddoo.

124
00:05:56,395 --> 00:06:00,915
Fortunately, vegetables and spinach were promoted when I was young.

125
00:06:00,915 --> 00:06:06,439
You won't believe this, but since I was 12 years old, I haven't had any soft drinks.

126
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:10,770
I stopped drinking soft drinks like Pepsi and Coca-Cola at 12 years old,

127
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,875
because I was obsessed with eating healthy.

128
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,149
2008, when I was around 14-15 years old,

129
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,788
reading became a passion.

130
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:27,266
I loved reading books.

131
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:31,459
The credit lies solely with Satyajit Ray's books.

132
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,363
At this point in time, had you asked me,

133
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:35,433
what I wanted to be once I grew up,

134
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:39,389
I would have answered, "A criminal investigator or a detective."

135
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:42,719
This is because I loved the Feluda series.

136
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:46,373
I read these detective stories every single day.

137
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,518
And it kept playing in my head.

138
00:06:48,518 --> 00:06:50,231
Of course, soon I realised that

139
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:53,923
today, detectives weren't the same as depicted in novels.

140
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:56,378
After a little research on the internet, I found that

141
00:06:56,378 --> 00:06:59,308
most private detectives hired nowadays,

142
00:06:59,308 --> 00:07:03,095
were hired to catch cheating spouses.

143
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:05,889
And the serious investigators working with the police,

144
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:08,784
didn't work the same way as written in the books.

145
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:11,278
Overall, a terrible career option.

146
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:15,107
Around this time, I developed an interest in Mechanical Robots.

147
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:17,642
"You need to turn this to make it move."

148
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:20,540
"Light sensor."

149
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:23,347
"And the touch sensor is on the bumper."

150
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:26,907
"Press this here."

151
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,456
My parents had bought me this set that I absolutely loved.

152
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:34,847
These Lego blocks could be used to create robots

153
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:37,304
with touch sensors and light sensors.

154
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:39,685
They could be programmed.

155
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:41,916
I was so obsessed with it for hours that

156
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,493
I made my own robot, programmed it,

157
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,216
to carry a digital camera

158
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,070
so that whenever it hit something,

159
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,035
it would activate its touch sensor

160
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:52,278
and it would change direction and continue going forwards.

161
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:05,542
I wasn't born a genius.

162
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,320
neither was I a talented child.

163
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,026
If you see the marks I got at school,

164
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:12,000
I was an above-average student.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,286
I got about 70%-80% at school.

166
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,660
I believe that if any child is given such toys,

167
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,929
and if the child spends enough time with these,

168
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:21,554
anyone could build these things.

169
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:24,906
And thankfully, there weren't any social media to distract me.

170
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:26,307
Or to waste my time.

171
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:28,834
Which allowed me to spend time on these.

172
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:31,252
Fast forwarding 2 years, in 2010,

173
00:08:31,252 --> 00:08:35,304
In 2010, had you asked me what I wanted to be once I grew up,

174
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:40,567
I would have answered, "a host on National Geographic or Discovery Channel."

175
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:45,938
At this time, the programs on these channels were my favourites.

176
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:48,765
Like Bear Grills' Man vs Wild.

177
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:50,928
Or the shows on Travel and Living Channel

178
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:54,668
where new countries and hotels were explored.

179
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:58,478
Luckily, I'm doing something similar on my vlog channel now.

180
00:08:58,478 --> 00:09:01,782
I believe myself to be very fortunate to get this opportunity.

181
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:06,537
But back then, I had no idea about how to choose this career option.

182
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:09,928
How did one get to interview with the TV channels?

183
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:12,545
If one wanted to choose this career path, what was to be done?

184
00:09:12,545 --> 00:09:13,890
What should one study?

185
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,382
I had no idea.

186
00:09:15,382 --> 00:09:19,805
In December 2011, Anna Hazare, Arvind Kejriwal, and other social activists,

187
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:22,744
began protesting against rampant corruption all over the country.

188
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:26,172
Media gave a lot of positive coverage to these protests.

189
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:28,617
Something that is impossible to imagine nowadays.

190
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:31,076
Any protest getting such positive coverage. 

191
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:35,191
But friends, this began my interest in politics.

192
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,790
The sole reason.

193
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,071
Because friends, in my family, relatives,

194
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,688
even among the far-flung relatives,

195
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:42,672
there's not a single person

196
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:44,752
that has any connection to politics.

197
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,095
Zero political connection.

198
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:49,449
This is important for the people spreading misinformation about me,

199
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:51,949
that I have a connection with such and such political party,

200
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:54,514
or that so and so family member is in a political party,

201
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:55,563
they're lying.

202
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:58,912
Before 2011, I had zero interest in politics.

203
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:01,381
Traditionally, in most Haryanvi families,

204
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:03,257
2 professions have been the most common.

205
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:05,989
Begin in agricultural or armed forces.

206
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:08,466
You'd see this in my family too.

207
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:11,706
Three of my close relatives are in the Army.

208
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:14,008
My maternal grandfather and 2 uncles.

209
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:15,661
Several people are involved in agriculture.

210
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:19,452
In fact, it was rare for my father to be an engineer.

211
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,235
Anyway, getting back to my story,

212
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:25,086
After 2012-13, my interest in politics deepened.

213
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:27,894
When the AAP government was formed in Delhi for the first time.

214
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,757
Arvind Kejriwal's famous 49-day government was formed.

215
00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:34,637
And when Narendra Modi became the new Prime Minister in 2014,

216
00:10:34,637 --> 00:10:37,355
my interest in politics deepened further.

217
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:42,126
Like many people, I was delighted to see the Congress government lose power.

218
00:10:42,126 --> 00:10:47,549
A person who promised to bring back the black money within 100 days,

219
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:48,863
to end corruption,

220
00:10:48,863 --> 00:10:51,254
back then, my political ideology

221
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:53,203
was 100% anti-congress.

222
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:55,561
I hated the Congress party,

223
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:58,300
because that was the narrative set by the media and TV channels.

224
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,136
It was only later that I found out

225
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:03,570
the level to which the media could fall.

226
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,658
But even before that, it took me only a few months 

227
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:08,867
to realise the misdirections.

228
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,744
Black money wasn't going to come back.

229
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:13,145
In fact, RTI was going to be diluted.

230
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:16,753
Foreign funding for political parties was going to be legalised.

231
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:18,806
Corruption began at a larger scale,

232
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:20,335
but it would be hidden.

233
00:11:20,335 --> 00:11:21,978
Media would be bought.

234
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:24,841
Seeing it happen, in a bought of frustration,

235
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:27,883
I published the initial videos on YouTube.

236
00:11:27,883 --> 00:11:29,333
But enough about the politics.

237
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,096
But the very first video published on the channel

238
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:35,000
was a travel vlog in 2014.

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,988
To understand how that came to be

240
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,641
let's rewind to 2012.

241
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:42,964
That was the year I completed my 12th board.

242
00:11:42,964 --> 00:11:45,259
I got 85% on it.

243
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:48,430
My philosophy was always the 80-20 rule.

244
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,119
Though I didn't know about the 80-20 rule then,

245
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:54,156
but I always used this subconsciously.

246
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:58,503
I believed one should study only to get a good enough score.

247
00:11:58,503 --> 00:12:01,311
That would be sufficient to show people that

248
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:03,765
you're a good enough student.

249
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,591
But not to expect a topper.

250
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:10,913
I realised that if you had to study for 2 days to get 80% marks,

251
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:15,681
you had to study for 8 more days for the remaining 20%.

252
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:18,641
It means that it's quite easy to get 80%,

253
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:21,509
But it is increasingly difficult to take it to 100%.

254
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,118
It takes a lot more effort.

255
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,323
Why should I put in the extra effort?

256
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:26,008
I wasn't interested in being a topper.

257
00:12:26,008 --> 00:12:30,064
You'd say that it's important to get into good colleges,

258
00:12:30,064 --> 00:12:31,597
or else you won't get admission.

259
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:33,007
You're right, but

260
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:36,192
I wasn't very interested in going to top-notch colleges.

261
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:39,570
And thankfully, there wasn't any pressure from my parents for this.

262
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,384
My parents were content with me not being a topper

263
00:12:42,384 --> 00:12:44,046
because I was good enough at studies,

264
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:45,586
they believed I'd manage well.

265
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:48,982
Friends, I learned about the 80-20 Rule later,

266
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:50,977
and started applying it in my life.

267
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:52,422
This rule basically says that

268
00:12:52,422 --> 00:12:55,735
you do not need to be 100% perfect in everything.

269
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:58,988
Instead, put in the bare minimum efforts to be 80% perfect,

270
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:00,982
and for many things in life, that will be enough.

271
00:13:00,982 --> 00:13:03,508
Obviously, if you aim at being a topper,

272
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:06,344
you need to be 100% perfect at your studies.

273
00:13:06,344 --> 00:13:09,738
But this strategy can be used in all aspects of life.

274
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:13,081
I talked about this in detail in my course on Time Management.

275
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:14,765
If you haven't enrolled for the course

276
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:16,927
I recommend that you try it out,

277
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,534
if you are a student or work at a 9-5 job,

278
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:23,723
you can learn how you can maximise your time.

279
00:13:23,723 --> 00:13:25,618
I learned this from my experience.

280
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:31,630
How am I able to manage the channels and travel all at once?

281
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,590
I talk about all of it in this course.

282
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,392
I tell you practically

283
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:38,378
how you can use these techniques in your life,

284
00:13:38,378 --> 00:13:39,580
and improve yourself.

285
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,379
The link to this course is in the description below.

286
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:43,675
Honestly, those who have taken this course,

287
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:46,134
say that it has been life-changing for them. 

288
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:48,984
The first 500 people to buy this course

289
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:53,185
will get 50% off with the coupon code DR50.

290
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:55,070
Go join it ASAP.

291
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,512
Getting back to my story,

292
00:13:56,512 --> 00:13:59,400
you'd be wondering what I chose after the 12th.

293
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,212
I wanted to have all my options open.

294
00:14:01,212 --> 00:14:03,127
I took the admission tests for various colleges.

295
00:14:03,127 --> 00:14:06,422
Such as Manipal University, IIT, JEE,

296
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:07,974
Back then the two IIT and JEE were separate exams.

297
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:11,002
But unfortunately, none of the ranks was so good

298
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:12,664
that I could secure admission.

299
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:16,193
So yeah, the 80-20 philosophy isn't a good idea

300
00:14:16,193 --> 00:14:19,265
if you want to be a topper and secure admission to IIT.

301
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:21,517
Apart from these engineering exams,

302
00:14:21,517 --> 00:14:23,197
I sat for the NDA exam too.

303
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:26,881
Actually, to be honest, joining Indian Air Force or the Indian Army,

304
00:14:26,881 --> 00:14:30,591
was my first choice, 
instead of these engineering colleges.

305
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:32,090
There were 2 main reasons for this.

306
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,211
First, when I think about office jobs,

307
00:14:35,211 --> 00:14:36,789
it seems astoundingly boring to me.

308
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:40,445
A job with the Army is more physically challenging and adventurous.

309
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:42,715
Second, as I told you before,

310
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,261
several relatives were in the Army.

311
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:48,995
So I made sure to study really well for this exam,

312
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:50,871
because it was important to pass that.

313
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:53,611
Friends, there are 2 stages in the selection process of NDA.

314
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:55,087
First is the written test.

315
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:56,708
And the second is the SSB interview.

316
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:00,176
After passing the written test, I was called to Varanasi for the interview.

317
00:15:00,176 --> 00:15:02,486
I was very confident when I went to Varanasi,

318
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:05,341
because there are 2 stages in the interview stage.

319
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:06,851
One of which was the physical test.

320
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:10,084
I was confident that I would easily pass the physical test

321
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:12,560
because I considered myself to be very fit.

322
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,063
And then was the actual interview.

323
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:17,686
Friends, this was perhaps the most ironic event in my life.

324
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:20,988
In the interview process, candidates are given a topic,

325
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:23,801
and they are asked to discuss and debate it.

326
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:26,428
A group of 10-12 students are formed.

327
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:31,219
And the group is given a topic to debate on.

328
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:33,499
I was a part of such a group.

329
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,449
And when it was our turn, they gave us a topic,

330
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:37,614
And we were asked to start our debate.

331
00:15:37,614 --> 00:15:39,192
Before I could even think about it

332
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:43,169
some people started to debate it passionately. 

333
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:45,485
I looked to one and the others,

334
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:48,416
and could get in only a few sentences

335
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,033
about what I agreed with and what I disagreed with.

336
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,486
And within moments the debate ended.

337
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:57,093
Back then, I wasn't good at putting my point across.

338
00:15:57,093 --> 00:15:58,598
I talked slowly.

339
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:00,642
And in this interview, they were looking for people

340
00:16:00,642 --> 00:16:02,997
who could talk straightforwardly, loudly, and clearly.

341
00:16:02,997 --> 00:16:04,872
With a powerful voice.

342
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:06,270
And do you know how my speaking style was?

343
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,444
Like this.

344
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:09,401
"Integrated within the gearbox.

345
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,791
And now as a belt-driven system

346
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,643
for more flexibility

347
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:14,884
and shock-handling capability."

348
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:17,066
Obviously, I failed this interview

349
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:19,815
and then we began planning for what we could do next.

350
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:21,423
Which college we could choose.

351
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:25,116
Then my parents began looking at colleges outside of India

352
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:27,154
because they believed that better than

353
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:30,014
getting admission to any C-grade engineering college in India,

354
00:16:30,014 --> 00:16:32,058
was studying abroad.

355
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,339
And then we chose Germany.

356
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:36,325
You'd ask why Germany.

357
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:37,828
It was simple.

358
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:39,995
The other English-speaking developed countries

359
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:41,896
such as the USA, the UK, Australia, Canada

360
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:44,706
have high tuition fees.

361
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:47,281
Studying there would've been very expensive.

362
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:49,757
On the other hand, in Germany and other European countries

363
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:51,676
studying is almost free

364
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,332
because there're no tuition fees.

365
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:56,336
Especially if you study in their local languages.

366
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:58,860
Obviously, there would still be living expenses.

367
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,145
The living costs are quite expensive.

368
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,984
For that, my parents took out an education loan.

369
00:17:03,984 --> 00:17:06,583
The applications were sent to several colleges and universities.

370
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,564
And the acceptance came from 2 places.

371
00:17:08,564 --> 00:17:11,305
First was the Eindhoven University in the Netherlands.

372
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:14,487
And the second was Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

373
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:19,104
We saw that they were among the well respected and high-ranking universities in the world.

374
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,840
How did I secure admission without being a topper?

375
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,009
All I can say about this is that

376
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,970
perhaps, it was luck to a large extent

377
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,496
because back then in 2012, not many people went abroad to study,

378
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:34,944
and the number of foreigners applying to these universities wasn't large.

379
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:36,369
So there wasn't a lot of competition.

380
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:38,915
The other reason that might have played a role in it was perhaps

381
00:17:38,915 --> 00:17:43,939
that the foreign universities don't focus much on marks.

382
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:48,079
They focus on other skills, hobbies, and experiences.

383
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,413
Perhaps when I showed my interest in Lego robots,

384
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:53,784
and mentioned it on the application,

385
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:55,426
that might have played a role.

386
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:58,040
Because the course I applied for was

387
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,775
In August 2012, at 17 years old,

388
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:05,590
I moved from India to Germany.

389
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,922
Here, if you ask me why I chose Mechanical Engineering

390
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,128
one of the reasons was that

391
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:15,303
the interest in robotics and technology that I had since early childhood,

392
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,953
but the second but bigger reason was that

393
00:18:17,953 --> 00:18:21,870
at 17 years, which child knows what they should do?

394
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,692
Most of my friends and classmates were choosing engineering

395
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:26,810
and back then, it was often said that

396
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,096
if you don't know what you should do,

397
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:32,081
you should do engineering and then decide what you really want to do.

398
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:34,975
So even though I wasn't 100% sure,

399
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:36,250
about what I wanted to do,

400
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,716
engineering seemed like a good option,

401
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:39,933
so I chose to do that.

402
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,453
Later, I found it quite interesting. 

403
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:46,615
And I completed the Bachelor's course in 2015

404
00:18:46,615 --> 00:18:49,884
after which I did my Master's in Renewable Engineering

405
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:52,999
from the same university at Karlsruhe.

406
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,861
This university, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology,

407
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:59,218
I made a vlog on the university tour.

408
00:18:59,218 --> 00:19:02,178
In case you haven't watched it,
the link to it is in the description below.

409
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:04,521
Interestingly, in 2014,

410
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:06,466
during an internship,

411
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:08,215
I move out of the University

412
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,322
for an internship at the office of a company,

413
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:12,066
It was a bit away from the main city.

414
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:14,961
About a 1-hour trip daily by tram.

415
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:18,909
On this tram, I met a girl, Juli.

416
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,509
We took the same tram every day

417
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:24,562
Juli would be on her to her school,
and I'd be going for the internship.

418
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:27,530
Exactly 7.5 years after this,

419
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,057
we got married.

420
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,572
2014 was the year when I uploaded my first video on YouTube.

421
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:42,129
This happened a few months after meeting Juli.

422
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:47,027
This was the time when my fascination with YouTube began.

423
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:51,308
I discovered the existence of such a platform.

424
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:54,526
I was interested in making videos since my childhood,

425
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,006
so I started using this platform.

426
00:19:57,006 --> 00:20:00,378
And eventually began uploading videos regularly.

427
00:20:00,378 --> 00:20:03,908
We crossed the 50,000 subscriber mark in 2017,

428
00:20:03,908 --> 00:20:08,350
but my parents didn't think that it could be a career option.

429
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,659
On top of it, I believed that even if it did become a career option,

430
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:15,010
perhaps this wouldn't generate a respectable amount of income.

431
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,264
So I decided to continue with my studies.

432
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:19,401
And then in 2018,

433
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,135
I got my Master's degree.

434
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,928
And another Bachelor's

435
00:20:22,928 --> 00:20:25,129
on Economics and Business Management.

436
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:28,243
But this was purely out of interest.

437
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:31,581
So that I could make better videos.

438
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:34,045
So that I could do this better.

439
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:38,691
After 2017-18, I put YouTube as the #1 priority,

440
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:40,819
and kept education on #2.

441
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:42,808
Because this was my passion.

442
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,775
I started believing that this was possible.

443
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:49,417
That I could definitely do something that was never done before.

444
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:50,693
And that was it, friends.

445
00:20:50,693 --> 00:20:52,618
When one is passionate about something,

446
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:55,156
when you truly enjoy doing something,

447
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:59,089
It is easy to bring consistency and discipline into it.

448
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:01,358
I won't say that it's entirely easy,

449
00:21:01,358 --> 00:21:04,715
you still need to put in your efforts and hard work.

450
00:21:04,715 --> 00:21:07,299
But to a large extent, it is comparatively easier.

451
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,145
Remember that dialogue in 3 Idiots?

452
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:11,618
You should study to be capable, not successful. 

453
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,060
"A great man once said,

454
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,877
"Study not to be successful, but to be capable." 

455
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:17,543
Don't chase success.

456
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,770
Excellence, chase excellence.

457
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,549
And success will follow you."

458
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:22,753
Remember this.

459
00:21:22,753 --> 00:21:27,506
I never focused on reaching a certain number of subscribers.

460
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:30,352
Throughout my YouTube career, I focused on

461
00:21:30,352 --> 00:21:32,345
how I could keep improving myself.

462
00:21:32,345 --> 00:21:35,984
On how I could improve the quality of the videos I produce.

463
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:40,742
And how I could better deliver my message to you.

464
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:45,073
I simply hope that you keep enjoying future videos.

465
00:21:45,073 --> 00:21:47,044
If you want to ask me anything,

466
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:48,732
you can ask your questions in the comment section,

467
00:21:48,732 --> 00:21:53,886
Since this is a special video, I will try to answer as many questions as I can.

468
00:21:53,886 --> 00:21:55,026
And I'll see you in the next video.

469
00:21:55,026 --> 00:21:56,390

And what inspired you to invent this game?

I joined 2 games and got this idea.

But where did you get this idea?

488
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:49,684
That's a football and this is a hockey stick,

you get Hockey-Football.
