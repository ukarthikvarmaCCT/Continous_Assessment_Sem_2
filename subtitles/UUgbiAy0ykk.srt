1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:07,299
 This boy

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,907
 this truck

3
00:00:08,907 --> 00:00:10,995
 this girl

4
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:12,809
 this car

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,101
 Look at these four words

6
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:18,001
 With all these nouns

7
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,729
 we used only one demonstrative adjective

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,453
 that is 'this'

9
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:25,787
 If you look at the first two words,

10
00:00:25,787 --> 00:00:29,343
 I'm sure you know their French equivalents

11
00:00:29,344 --> 00:00:31,680
because we've already learned them.

12
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:39,656
 but what about 'this girl' and 'this car'?

13
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,044
 No......

14
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,279
 Here, 'ce' won't do

15
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:48,806
 but what will?

16
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:50,965
 cette

17
00:00:50,965 --> 00:00:54,001
 So, tell me, what should we say here?

18
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:01,912
 So now, can you tell me,

19
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:06,676
 I used 'ce' with the first two words

20
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:11,623
 And I used 'cette' with the last two words

21
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:13,083
 Whay?

22
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,974
 I'll tell you why

23
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:18,599
 The word 'fille' is a feminine noun

24
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,000
 That's why I used 'cette' there

25
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:23,856
 The next word is 'voiture' (car)

26
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:27,327
 'Car' is also a feminine noun in French

27
00:01:27,327 --> 00:01:30,262
 and 'voiture' is the French word for 'car'

28
00:01:30,262 --> 00:01:33,361
 So I used 'cette' with 'car'

29
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:36,409
 I already told you that 'voiture' is a feminine  noun

30
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,766
 and hence 'cette' with this nou

31
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:42,276
 Let's try some more examples...

32
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,977
 If 'this girl' is 'cette fille',

33
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:13,605
 then what about 'that girl'?

34
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:16,991
 In order to say 'that',

35
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:18,936
 there is no special word in French.

36
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:21,916
 So, there also you can use 'ce/cette'

37
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,787
 Okay' let's do one thing.

38
00:02:23,787 --> 00:02:26,265
 Let's make some more sentences

39
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:28,404
 and practice further with them.

40
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:54,439
 We'll meet again in the next video

41
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,313
 until then,  bye

42
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:58,073
 ma'm, wait ma'm

43
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:01,236
 Oh, what happened?

44
00:03:01,236 --> 00:03:03,529
 We need  more sentences ma'm

45
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:08,343
 Oh, you're saying you need more sentences?

46
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:10,366
 Do I Need to say this? that...

47
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:13,026
 go to the description box and practice

48
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,232
 Bye!
