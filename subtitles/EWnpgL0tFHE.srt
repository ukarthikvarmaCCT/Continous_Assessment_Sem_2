1
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:14,766
Good morning, sir.

2
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,566
I'm your new assistant..

3
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:18,686
Is the boss not here?

4
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:31,086
No matter what it is

5
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:33,806
my boss doesn't let others
take control of him.

6
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:12,606
Good morning, sir.

7
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:24,646
I never knew he could smile.

8
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:27,206
He does smile.

9
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:28,406
But the thing is..

10
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:31,366
He only smiles for his siblings
Sonu and Karthik.

11
00:01:31,406 --> 00:01:32,406
Oh!

12
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:35,606
'Brother, please decide
a lehenga for me!'

13
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,446
'Okay. - Which one do you
like among these?'

14
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:40,046
'Or this..'

15
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:41,086
'Oh, my God!
Look at this one.'

16
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,606
'This?'

17
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:44,446
'Brother,
they're so beautiful.'

18
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:48,086
'There are too many of them.'

19
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:50,606
'Brother, please!'

20
00:01:50,926 --> 00:01:52,126
'You have no idea about'

21
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,246
'how sentimental girls
are about the lehengas.'

22
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:55,566
'That's true.'

23
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,806
'That is always mentioned
in a girl's CV.'

24
00:01:57,886 --> 00:01:59,486
'They can wear it
like professionals.'

25
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,606
'Why are you jealous?'

26
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:04,766
'You should buy
this simple one.'

27
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:07,806
'Brother, I'm buying a lehenga
for my engagement'

28
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:09,526
'and not to take my dog
on a walk.'

29
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:11,566
'Select again.'

30
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:14,006
'You could've bought
a new house for that money.'

31
00:02:14,206 --> 00:02:16,966
'Yes, but I can't wear
a house, right?'

32
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,766
'Guys!'

33
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:21,926
'I have a meeting now.'

34
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,246
'I'll come home
and choose one.'

35
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:25,082
'Brother, that will too late.'

36
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:27,282
'I can't select anything
without selecting the lehenga.'

37
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:29,442
'Neither the earrings
nor the necklace.'

38
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:30,642
Excuse me, sir.

39
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:32,322
You have a meeting
with Mr. Mehta

40
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:34,162
in the cafe in 15 minutes.

41
00:02:58,842 --> 00:03:00,242
What the heck!

42
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:22,002
Hi!

43
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:24,082
I have to deal
with a big problem.

44
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,442
Can you please give me
a lift?

45
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:26,802
Please help me.

46
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:31,362
I'm saying the truth.

47
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,642
You can see it on my face.

48
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:36,282
Look at me.

49
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,202
Look closer.

50
00:03:57,562 --> 00:03:58,642
Hurry up!
Get in the car.

51
00:03:58,682 --> 00:04:00,162
He has agreed.
Get in!

52
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:01,162
The driver.

53
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:13,322
Drive towards CP.

54
00:04:20,922 --> 00:04:22,002
What are you looking at?

55
00:04:22,522 --> 00:04:23,402
Let's go.

56
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:53,962
People don't get
their desired username

57
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:55,842
but you got your desired spouse

58
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,242
because of me!

59
00:04:57,482 --> 00:04:58,962
Couldn't you have put
in a little effort?

60
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:00,802
Why were running
in the same place?

61
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:03,682
Thank God we found this guy.

62
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,882
'This guy..'

63
00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:08,762
Your families would've
caught you otherwise!

64
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:10,922
Were families after you?

65
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:13,322
Joint families!
Two of them!

66
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:16,802
Aunts, brothers-in-law,
grandmothers, children..

67
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:20,002
Kids.. One of them followed
us on a tricycle.

68
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:22,722
Why were they following you?

69
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:26,002
I got them eloped and married.

70
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:28,042
And..

71
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:33,562
What..

72
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:35,122
What's up with him?

73
00:05:36,522 --> 00:05:37,482
Out.

74
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:38,842
I said, get out!

75
00:05:43,122 --> 00:05:44,282
Why, though?

76
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:46,322
I can't have a girl who gets
people eloped

77
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:48,842
and married
and hurts their families.

78
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:52,442
All right!

79
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:54,042
It's fine if you put me out.

80
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:56,922
Drop these two..
- They have to get out as well.

81
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:58,842
Why won't you listen to me..

82
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:00,322
You two, out.

83
00:06:01,642 --> 00:06:02,842
Those people will come soon!

84
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:04,002
You don't understand..
- Shut up!

85
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:06,082
And you two..

86
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:08,042
What's wrong with you guys?

87
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:10,642
Family is everything!

88
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:14,042
But youngsters these days
don't understand family values.

89
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:17,602
Do you have any idea how bad
your families must be feeling

90
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:19,202
because of what you've done?

91
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:23,242
What's the girl's age?

92
00:06:24,882 --> 00:06:26,282
Is she legally adult?

93
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:29,842
Oh, God!

94
00:06:31,322 --> 00:06:32,362
Show me your face.

95
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:43,242
She doesn't look
it but she's legally adult.

96
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:01,362
Don't.
- I'm sorry

97
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:02,922
but it's an emergency.

98
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:17,482
What's up with him?

99
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,722
It's my effect.

100
00:07:19,362 --> 00:07:20,402
I don't mess with hearts

101
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:22,162
but directly with minds.

102
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:28,482
Sir..

103
00:07:28,602 --> 00:07:29,442
Your car?

104
00:07:29,722 --> 00:07:30,802
It was stolen.

105
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:33,882
It's not a problem, sir!

106
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:35,962
We can do this!

107
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,962
We can get into this car..

108
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:41,802
And go..

109
00:07:54,162 --> 00:07:56,242
Feed sweets to each other.

110
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,562
Ishki, thank you.

111
00:08:15,282 --> 00:08:17,162
You took such a huge
risk for our sake..

112
00:08:17,282 --> 00:08:18,202
Sir

113
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:20,082
you have to take risks for love.

114
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:21,522
Such a huge one..

115
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:23,842
You stole a man's car.

116
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,082
There's a limit to risks.

117
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:28,762
That's the point!

118
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:30,362
There are no limits
when love is concerned!

119
00:08:31,202 --> 00:08:33,162
Love is the most valuable
thing in this world.

120
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:35,042
Even if life is lost

121
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:37,442
in its pursuit, it can be
considered a good bargain.

122
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:47,922
You've lucky

123
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,042
to have love.

124
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:53,162
Don't lose it.

125
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:56,122
Also

126
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:58,242
just because someone
will fast for your long life

127
00:08:58,282 --> 00:09:00,602
doesn't mean you can neglect
taking medicines.

128
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:23,362
I've heard a lot about you.

129
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:25,842
The great Veer Malhotra.

130
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:27,482
I'd heard that
you're very punctual.

131
00:09:27,522 --> 00:09:28,762
You're whole five minutes late.

132
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:31,762
You don't know
the value of time.

133
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,082
I'm sorry, sir.

134
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,002
Increase the price.

135
00:09:42,122 --> 00:09:44,282
That's because the rate
has jumped

136
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:47,402
to Rs. 5 crores. - But we'd
a deal for Rs. 4 crores.

137
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:50,482
Verbal commitments
can always change.

138
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:21,442
Darn!

139
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,442
Excuse me, sir.

140
00:10:33,722 --> 00:10:35,922
Why did you two come here?
Why?

141
00:10:37,922 --> 00:10:40,522
Brother, it's high time
you finalise her dress.

142
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:43,042
Guys, I'm in a meeting!
- I'm sorry, Brother.

143
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,209
I can't shop till my dress
is finalised. Please pick one!

144
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:49,089
Look.

145
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:57,562
Hurry up!

146
00:10:58,802 --> 00:11:00,802
This one.
- Thank you, Brother!

147
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:02,882
You're the best!

148
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:06,762
Why did you close your ears?
- This dress is loud.

149
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:09,802
Stop criticising!
- I can't help it.

150
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:11,522
Guys!

151
00:11:18,322 --> 00:11:19,802
I'm extremely sorry, sir.

152
00:11:20,522 --> 00:11:22,562
Actually, my sister
is getting engaged tomorrow.

153
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:24,602
And family is everything
to me.

154
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:28,322
What did you decide?

155
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:45,042
It is Rs. 5 crores
or consider the deal cancelled.

156
00:11:45,802 --> 00:11:47,762
Not with you

157
00:11:47,802 --> 00:11:51,042
I'm talking to your dad.
- He has gone old.

158
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:53,402
So, talk to me.

159
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:57,962
Either it is 5 crores
or get out of here.

160
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:12,722
Sir, family runs on two things.

161
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:15,922
Love and discipline.

162
00:12:17,282 --> 00:12:21,882
When youngsters doesn't respect
their elders, problem arises.

163
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,202
This cheque is worth
Rs. 6 crores.

164
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:30,282
Twice, your son spoke
rudely with you in front of me.

165
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:32,962
Punish him like a father..

166
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:37,202
And this cheque is yours.

167
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:49,842
You..

168
00:12:57,922 --> 00:13:00,722
Hey!
Stop provoking my haggard dad.

169
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:02,842
Stop picking up
topics on family.

170
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,562
Everybody knows
about your family.

171
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:10,402
Your mom ran away..

172
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:13,802
And you teach us
about family values.

173
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:46,884
The way your mom ran away,
your sister will follow suite.

174
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:45,343
I'm not able to do it.
You help me.

175
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:55,943
Not like that!

176
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,663
Give me the cotton.

177
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:05,149
Since childhood,
we'd to bear the embarrassment.

178
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:07,429
We'd to put up to taunts.

179
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:10,709
Why did mom take
that step, Brother?

180
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:14,429
No mother leaves
their children in the lurch.

181
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,069
How long will we have
to bear this insults?

182
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:25,909
Forever.

183
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:32,189
A mother leaves behind memories
for her children.

184
00:16:33,669 --> 00:16:35,509
But our mother left

185
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:39,709
only shame and embarrassment.

186
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:44,029
No wonder when I hear her name..

187
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:55,509
I'm sorry.

188
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:11,789
I lost control.

189
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:15,629
I'm your elder brother.

190
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:21,429
My duty is to protect our family

191
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:24,149
and its values.

192
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:27,709
Not to create a scene.

193
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:35,509
I'm really sorry.

194
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:40,029
'I won't let any harm
come to my family.'

195
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,669
I need to return the car, too.

196
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:46,589
How do I find the address?

197
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:02,789
'Ahaan Veer Malhotra'..

198
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,709
The name doesn't suit him
at all.

199
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:12,149
Sonu, is it true that
your in-laws don't wear shorts?

200
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:15,149
Why? - Because they live
in a penthouse.

201
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:20,029
Brother, don't laugh
and encourage his jokes.

202
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:23,869
I've got such strange brothers.
One can even die for me

203
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:26,749
and the other won't even
pass me the TV remote.

204
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:29,189
W-Why can't you be like brother?

205
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,189
It's so tough for even him
to be himself.

206
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:32,749
Then how can I?

207
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:34,629
But I can be like you.

208
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:37,829
And talk all the time
about marriage! - So what?

209
00:18:38,229 --> 00:18:40,829
Everyone has a dream.
So do I!

210
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:43,389
To marry a nice man
and settle down.

211
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:45,349
Don't steal my dream!

212
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:47,829
Do you want to marry
a nice man, too?

213
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:50,029
Very funny!
- I know.

214
00:18:50,469 --> 00:18:52,789
I want to marry a working woman
and settle down.

215
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:55,829
When we have kids
we'll share responsibilities.

216
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:58,349
It's responsibilities.

217
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:01,629
Not some property
to share so excitedly!

218
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,509
I want no responsibilities
at all.

219
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:07,509
After marriage
there'll be no restrictions!

220
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:10,949
Full freedom!
Everyone here always tells me

221
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:14,669
'do it after marriage'.
Finally I'm getting married!

222
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:18,069
Oh, my!
Happily ever after!

223
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:20,829
Brother's life is good, too.

224
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,429
Even his dreams are decent
like U certified films.

225
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:26,989
Where his wife appears
and only cooks for him.

226
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:33,029
Very funny!

227
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:35,229
You're laughing because
you think..

228
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:39,149
Cooking food, home making..
- Is a petty thing.

229
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:41,149
But not for me.
It's important to me.

230
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:44,749
So I want a good homemaker.
- Why not a working woman?

231
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:47,749
I've no problems,
but I need a housewife.

232
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,509
Things are fine
when people are a couple

233
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:54,029
but when they form a family
the dynamics change.

234
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:57,149
And three things are needed
to run that family.

235
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:00,789
Money, love and morals.

236
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:04,189
Oh, no!
Not the morals again! - Yes.

237
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:08,149
Earning money is
the husband's duty.

238
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:10,589
Love is that of both
and morals, that of the wife.

239
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:13,029
Brother, I really wish
you were my laptop.

240
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,869
At least I could upgrade you!

241
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:19,789
Brother, it's 2021,
not 1921!

242
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:22,469
Everything has changed!
- Nothing has changed.

243
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,549
Things have changed on surface,
it's still the same inside.

244
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:26,509
Family, family values..

245
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:29,309
Husband handles worldly matters
and the wife, home.

246
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:31,909
And your opinion
won't change anything.

247
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,069
This is the grammar
of relationships.

248
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:37,949
My plan is simple.
I just want a girl

249
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:40,109
providing for whom
will be my priority

250
00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:43,669
and my family and their respect
will be hers.

251
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,749
Hail the preacher!
- Hail the preacher!

252
00:20:49,709 --> 00:20:51,149
I must warn you.

253
00:20:51,469 --> 00:20:53,949
Both your expectations
about a working wife

254
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:55,349
and a homemaker

255
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:56,869
can be ruined by one thing.

256
00:20:58,229 --> 00:21:00,029
What?
- Love!

257
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:03,549
Oh!

258
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,669
It sounds so comforting!

259
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,749
The 'v' sound in the end!

260
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:10,829
'Love'..

261
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:12,309
Oh!

262
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:14,549
Oh, my God!
Tell me something.

263
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:17,309
What if you both
fall in love with a girl

264
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:19,069
of a different type?
- No way.

265
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:22,549
I just need a good homemaker.
- And me, a working woman.

266
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:24,949
We won't fall for anyone else.

267
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,189
Right, Brother?
- Really!

268
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,149
I think you guys have not heard.

269
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:32,589
There's no control over love.
- Control.

270
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:35,669
That's what I said.

271
00:21:35,949 --> 00:21:37,309
There's no control over love.

272
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:40,149
There's no control over love.

273
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:42,429
Did you see that?
I made you say it.

274
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,749
Did you hear that?
- Oh, nice!

275
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:49,189
Kids, where are you?

276
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:54,469
I knew that the three of you
would be here itself.

277
00:22:03,749 --> 00:22:04,949
Is the beer cold?

278
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:10,429
People consider beer
as 'shikhanji' these days.

279
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:15,349
They open the bottle
the moment summer sets in.

280
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,229
It's very hot today, right?

281
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:31,789
Aunt.

282
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:39,109
No, I'm not in a mood.
- Okay.

283
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:42,109
I'll have it if you are
forcing me so much.

284
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:45,949
Kids.

285
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:53,829
Did your aunt come here?

286
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,629
Oh!

287
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:08,909
You guys are drinking beer.

288
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:14,989
God knows that I stay away
from all this.

289
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:18,349
I drank only once

290
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:21,269
on the day of my 'roka'.

291
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:25,189
It is Sonu's 'roka' tomorrow.

292
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:29,309
She'll be heartbroken
if I don't drink.

293
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:36,189
Come on, open one bottle.

294
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:43,269
Wait.
Give it to me.

295
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:55,229
Kids, where are you?

296
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:06,829
You guys are sitting here.
I..

297
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:10,149
Oh, wow!
Beer?

298
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:13,029
Come on, open one bottle for me.

299
00:24:13,189 --> 00:24:15,789
It is Sonu's 'roka'.
I should drink one bottle.

300
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,829
Oh, wow!
Chilled beer.

301
00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:21,909
It's fun to drink with the kids.

302
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:28,309
What's happening in this house?

303
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:30,549
Nobody will hide anywhere now.

304
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:33,229
What do you mean?
Who else is hiding?

305
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:46,469
It is our Sonu's 'roka'
tomorrow.

306
00:24:46,629 --> 00:24:48,269
Let's celebrate together.

307
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:51,229
Come on, all of you say cheers.

308
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:00,789
Cheers!

309
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:08,629
The house will become empty
after Sonu leaves.

310
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:10,189
Oh, please, Aunt!

311
00:25:10,949 --> 00:25:13,509
The IQ level of this house
will increase after she leaves.

312
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:15,389
The level of noise will reduce.

313
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:17,549
We'll get an extra room too.

314
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:21,469
I will be so happy

315
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:23,349
that I'll start crying
as I'm laughing.

316
00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:30,549
I'll start crying.

317
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:54,669
You look ugly when you cry.
Yuck!

318
00:25:55,749 --> 00:25:57,949
He doesn't look like Tom Cruise
when smiling either.

319
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:05,549
Let's save our tears
for the farewell ceremony.

320
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:08,069
We'll only celebrate today.

321
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,360
What?
- A girl wants to meet you.

322
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:11,571
Huh?

323
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:13,411
What girl?

324
00:26:17,491 --> 00:26:19,331
One who's very special to you.

325
00:26:20,731 --> 00:26:21,691
What nonsense!

326
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:29,011
She brought a letter.
She must be special.

327
00:26:30,571 --> 00:26:31,811
I ever served her sweets.

328
00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:40,571
Did she bring the letter
for Aahan?

329
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:41,971
Yes.

330
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:44,691
I wonder what's in the letter.

331
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:45,971
Grandma, it probably
says

332
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,051
'My sweet Aahan'

333
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:49,971
'I have no ambitions'.

334
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:53,851
'The idea of a job
makes me dizzy'.

335
00:26:55,851 --> 00:26:59,211
'Making cauliflower parathas
for you in my dream'.

336
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:04,611
I'm absolutely sure

337
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,611
that the letter won't have
a single hug or a kiss.

338
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:08,571
Sonu!

339
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:10,171
Brother is too cultured.

340
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:12,171
Those come in the letters after
the marriage. - Guys, shut up!

341
00:27:14,771 --> 00:27:15,851
Who is this girl?

342
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:18,638
You're that car thief!
