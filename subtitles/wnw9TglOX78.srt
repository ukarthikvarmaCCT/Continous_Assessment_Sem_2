00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,500
Welcome everybody to Chai pe Charch... Chai with Sai.

2
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,360
Where I will be giving my heavily biased opinions on mildly interesting topics.

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,460
So our first topic of the day is Amit Bhadana's new music video 'Parichay'.

4
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,940
Amit Bhadana is the biggest Indian Youtuber with over 13M subscribers.

5
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,020
Now Im not going to forcefully roast Amit Bhadana just for the sake of it.

6
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,200
The music was good and the production quality was amazing.

7
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,960
It's one of the most well-produced videos in Indian Youtube.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,740
But the lyrics were a bit repetitive.

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,840
Who gives an introduction for 7 minutes? It doesnt take 7 minutes for an introduction.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,640
This is not a roast, this is more like a 'Saute'. Im just going to share my opinions.

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:15,700
The most interesting visual I found in the music video was when a hater is holding a phone and seeing a photo of Amit Bhadana hospitalised, and laughing on it.

12
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:22,100
So he is trying to show that his haters make fun of him being hospitalised.

13
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,040
That's not true. Your haters make fun of you because of your content.

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,640
Please dont be so arrogant.
But the music video was good.

15
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:40,140
And just in case, you din't realise that Amit Bhadana has worked hard, he makes sure you know that.

16
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,180
"I have worked hard."

17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,760
Wow nice everyone should work hard.

18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,660
"I have worked hard."

19
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,080
I got the point you have worked hard. No doubt.

20
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,800
"I have worked hard"

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:03,360
Okay I got that you worked hard, everyone works hard. What is your point?

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,660
"I have worked hard"

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,560
To hell with your 'Parichay'

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,420
On this music video, CarryMinati's response was this.

25
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,320
"Yes Amit Bhadana's 'Parichay' song is great. He has worked hard."

26
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,940
And BB ki Vines said this:
"Very good. He has worked hard."

27
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,440
This is just my personal opinion Im not saying that this is the truth.

28
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:41,640
Looking at this reaction it feels that this is the kind of reaction you give when you don't like something but you still give a diplomatic compliment so that the person asking it doesn't feel bad.

29
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,040
You have worked hard, nobody's denying that.

30
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,360
But even Amir Khan worked very hard to make 'Thugs of Hindustan'.

31
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,880
This video has the 'humble brag' feels throughout. Jake Paul will be proud.

32
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,720
Its a really good music video.
I will not roast just for the sake of roasting.

33
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,260
But it was a bit narcissistic. I wont deny that.

34
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,960
More than an introduction, it was more like a CV, that Amit Bhadana made for Bollywood.

35
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,680
Because few weeks ago he uploaded a 40 min long sketch.

36
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,100
Looking at that it seems like he is telling Bollywood that see, I can make films as well as songs.

37
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,840
I sincerely hope, that Amit Bhadana makes it into Bollywood.

38
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,200
But it will be a very sad day for the Indian Youtube if that happens. Indian comedy Youtube scene will die.

39
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,040
"I made children and parents laugh. I made family friendly content."

40
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:57,680
Also credit where it is due, in Amit Bhadana's recent videos, he has reduced the amount of misogynistic content. So I will apprecitate that.

41
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,080
Maybe he saw my roast video, maybe not,
but that doesnt matter.

42
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,580
What matters is that he is improving.

43
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:09,420
But nobody can deny Amit Bhadana's success. You can question his content, but you can't deny his smartness.

44
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,260
That music video got 1M Likes in just one day.

45
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,860
Congratulations to Amit Bhadana,
lets move on to our next topic.

46
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,280
I always forget to announce this...

47
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,960
I have made a subreddit of mine. r/SaimanSays

48
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:34,060
So please submit memes, funny videos and other mildly interesting stuff, so that I dont have to struggle to find content.

49
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,640
Our next topic everybody, Technical Guruji exposed.

50
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,760
Now I respect Tehcnical Guruji a lot, because he uploads 2 videos a day.

51
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,960
And he is doing that since the past 2-3 (years).

52
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:57,640
But a Youtuber called TechStar Shahrukh has exposed Technical Guruj, saying that he is biased.

53
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:06,200
Technical Guruji is the leading Hindi technology channel and he uploaded a video where he did a bend test of the phone Redmi Note 7.

54
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:16,940
So the things about a bend test is that you have to apply pressure to the center of the phone,
to test the durability of the phone.

55
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,760
What Technical Guruji did is that he applied pressure to the edge of the phone.

56
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,600
"This phone is breaking into 2 pieces.
This is not a strong device."

57
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,740
The funny thing about this is that he applied so much pressure, that the bench shakes.

58
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:51,020
Youtuber TechStar Shahrukh says that Tehcnical Guruji did this bend test and broke the phone, as a revenge to Xiaomi's MD's tweet.

59
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:59,020
People are saying that this tweet by Manu Kumar Jain, who is the MD of Xiaomi was indirectly targeted to Technical Guruji.

60
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:08,580
And Technical Guruji did not like this, and that is why he did such an extreme bend test om Redmi Note 7 which is owned by Xiaomi.

61
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:20,580
TG is saying that the reason why he did such a harsh bend test on this phone is because this phone claimed that is is that tough.

62
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:28,420
"If any Youtuber does this test (bend test), there is a simple answer for that, and that's a publicity stunt."

63
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,700
Breaking a phone is easy, anyone can do that."

64
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:39,020
"Not necessary that if the phone is strong you cant break it. A man has a alot of strength."

65
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,900
"If you have decided to show that the phone breaks in the video, you can do it"

66
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,500
"You can make this video,
and then this video can go viral"

67
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,800
A lot of people are saying that technical guruji has sold out, and he is biased towards Samsung.

68
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,880
If Technical Guruji's channel gets shut down then who will say "Chaliye Shuru Karte Hai"??? (Let's Start)

69
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,120
Then we will have to "Chaliye band karte hai" (Lets stop)... Im not ready for that...

70
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,540
Please TG, I hope you have a good explanation.
Im rooting for you.

71
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
This tea gets cold very quickly in winter.

72
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:30,400
So our next topic is Pewdiepie vs T-series. Wow it feels like December again. I havent spoken about this topic since a long time.

73
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,520
SuperBowl is one of the biggest sporting events in the world, and definitely America's biggest sporting event.

74
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,800
And there was a lot of hype that Mr. Beast is going to advertise Pewdiepie on that show.

75
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,000
The SuperBowl show happened yesterday and Mr.Beast somehow promoted Pewdiepie, but people were underwhelmed.

76
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,800
Mr Beast and his team went to SuperBowl and they wore T-Shirts saying Subscribe to Pewdiepie.
That was funny but...

77
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,200
A lot of people thought that Mr Beast was going to buy billboards, or a TV commercial during the broadcast.

78
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,440
In my opinion it wasnt that bad because ESPN tweeted this picture. I dont know who Stephen Gostkowski is.

79
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,400
But in the picture you can clearly see Sub To Pewdiepie t-shirts in the audience.

80
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:20,440
And im pretty sure that ESPN tweeted this picture just because it had Sub to Pewdiepie in it.

81
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,600
So i guess in the end this strategy definitely worked. Mr Beast is smart.

82
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:32,680
Also the subgap was 29000 yesterday and most of the Indians were very excited that T-Series is finally going to take over Pewdiepie.

83
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,000
But as it always happends, the sub gap increased to almost 150000.

84
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,600
Mainly because Pewdiepie did a livestream playing Fortnite, which he hasnt done before.

85
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,020
and also VoiceOverPete and KeemStar did a livestream, which might have helped a bit.

86
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:57,040
I think this battle is going to go on forever.
And Im a proud insider/infiltrator, whatever my post is,
in the 9 YO army.

87
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,000
Also when popular Indian rapper Raftaar was asked who does he support between T-Series vs Pewdiepie...

88
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,460
He said that he supports Salil Jamdaar.

89
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:18,100
So Salil Jamdar made a disstrack on Carryminati, Pewdiepie and T-series. His diss on T-series is really damn good.

90
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:29,800
And Raftaar said he supports Salil Jamdar. Im happy that a superstar like Raftaar, is not being a sheep, and supporting Tseries because 'Patriotism'.

91
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,000
And of course, Amit Bhadana, Harsh Beniwal and Ashish Chanchlani have been promoting T-Series on their Social Medias.

92
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,100
"T-Series is very close to becoming India's No.1 channel, and I want everyone to subscribe to them"

93
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:04,340
"I have worked with them they are great people. T-Series values artists, they respect artists."

94
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:15,200
"You messages and comments have been telling me that T-Series is going to be the world's biggest channel"

95
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:26,520
"So subscribe to T-Series, so that when someone asks which is the highest subscribed channel in the world, people will say T-Series."

96
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:33,740
"Then people will ask that where is it from, people will say India. So that will be a proud moment for us."

97
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:42,700
I hope after few years when Youtube is dominated by corporations, these individual Indian Youtubers will realise, that they are digging their own grave.

98
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,060
If you keep supporting companies like this, in a few years no one will care about individual creators.

99
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,900
Also ending this video with a very wholesome news which happened on reddit.

100
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,080
So there is this subreddit called r/RoastMe

101
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,800
On that, one 17 year old Russian teenager posted this photo.

102
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:15,600
So the concept of this subreddit is that people post their pictures holding a card which says 'roast me'.

103
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:23,320
They get roasted pretty badly, but when this guys posted his picture, things were different.

104
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:37,560
If you see this photo, normally people are very enthusiastic in their photos, but this guy looks very sad.

105
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,160
Its really very sad, but people realised that.
