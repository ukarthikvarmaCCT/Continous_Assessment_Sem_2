1
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:28,175
Atreya!

2
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:32,256
Atreya!

3
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:35,824
Atreya!

4
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:39,364
Atreya! Open the door.

5
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:43,040
Atreya, call for you.

6
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:45,419
Hello.
- Hello.

7
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,892
Yes, uncle.
- Sheenu.

8
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,162
What do you want to say?

9
00:00:49,242 --> 00:00:51,041
You've to come home at the earliest.

10
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:55,297
In four hours a bus will
leave from Bhopal for Tirupati.

11
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:56,716
Get down at Nellore.

12
00:00:57,135 --> 00:00:58,906
Be brave. Take care.

13
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,515
What has happened, uncle?

14
00:01:14,028 --> 00:01:15,569
How did this happen, uncle?

15
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:30,285
When did it happen, uncle?

16
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:25,190
This is the most important
scene in this film.

17
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:26,718
Can you see that man sitting on the chair?

18
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:28,826
He's Kayzer Soze.

19
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:31,272
He's the mastermind behind all the crimes.

20
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:32,867
No way. Is it true?

21
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:35,732
Yes! I was also shocked
when I watched it the first time.

22
00:02:35,812 --> 00:02:39,475
When I watched the film for the second
time I knew that he was the criminal.

23
00:02:40,948 --> 00:02:43,867
Look. Look at his innocent face.

24
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:46,529
The character who appears
to be innocent and..

25
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:50,962
..incapable of committing any
crime should be the first crime suspect.

26
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:51,800
Watch it.

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,002
He's cooking up stories after
seeing the objects in the room.

28
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:09,286
Stop! Stop!

29
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:11,448
He was in which building?
- 344.

30
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:12,854
In which building was he supposed to go?

31
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:13,638
314.

32
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:16,543
How does he know?

33
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,746
This proves that DiCaprio is the police.

34
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:22,799
No way. Is this true?
- Yes.

35
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:26,029
Don't act melodramatic all the time.
Once is enough.

36
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:29,056
Even if the plan is perfect
the criminal panics and makes a mistake.

37
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:30,082
We need to notice it.

38
00:03:30,298 --> 00:03:31,231
Play it.

39
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:48,191
DiCaprio.

40
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:51,718
Do you like DiCaprio?

41
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:53,934
He's my favourite, sir.
- Really?

42
00:03:54,664 --> 00:03:56,029
Would you like to marry him?

43
00:03:56,678 --> 00:03:58,353
Of course, if I get the chance.

44
00:03:59,557 --> 00:04:02,827
No. You got bowled out by my googly.

45
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:04,976
Detectives don't have a personal life.

46
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:07,571
When you're investigating a case,
your concentration should be on it.

47
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:08,854
Okay?
- Hmm..

48
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:10,503
Sorry, sir.

49
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,747
Tell me something..

50
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:14,774
Do you like DiCaprio?
- He's disgusting.

51
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:17,247
That's good.

52
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:21,112
Did Tom Hanks come?
- Yes.

53
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:22,734
Did he meet DiCaprio?
- Yes.

54
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:24,180
Did he go to the hotel?
- Yes.

55
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,531
Did he give the wallet?
- Yes.

56
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:26,747
What do you think is in the wallet?

57
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,125
It has only a blank paper inside.

58
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:33,436
Even an experienced detective
like Tom Hanks was fooled.

59
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:35,112
Wait.

60
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:45,178
Agent Atreya.

61
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:50,030
Shirish, tell me.

62
00:04:52,597 --> 00:04:54,895
Okay. Okay. Right.

63
00:04:57,368 --> 00:04:58,503
Yes! Yes!

64
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,124
What happened, sir? Any good news?

65
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:02,705
A dead body has been found
near Gandhiji's statue in Nellore.

66
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:04,611
Somebody is dead.
- Huh?

67
00:05:06,152 --> 00:05:08,544
I mean.. we've got the case.

68
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:10,381
It's not yet clear if
it's a suicide or murder.

69
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:11,300
Oh!

70
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,503
I've to go there.

71
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:17,152
Did you see how detectives are?

72
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:19,220
You've to become like them.

73
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,882
An ordinary life is boring.

74
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:24,707
But, a detective's life
should be unique and interesting.

75
00:05:24,787 --> 00:05:28,436
Whatever we do should be done in style.

76
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,166
What if your styling
efforts bite the dust?

77
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:35,166
Look there.

78
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,585
If that happens make
sure that nobody is watching.

79
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:40,639
Oh!

80
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:41,545
Let's go.

81
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:43,734
To solve a crime..
Hold on.

82
00:05:44,558 --> 00:05:46,774
What are you doing?
- Sir, light, fan, TV..

83
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:49,382
No. We need to leave
immediately when we get a case.

84
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:52,842
Keep the TV on, the fan will keep moving..

85
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:55,680
..the light will be on,
and the shutter will be kept open.

86
00:05:56,991 --> 00:06:02,153
While visiting the crime scene it's
important to carry a coffee mug in hand.

87
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:04,829
Keep sipping the coffee.
C'mon, let's go.

88
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:46,368
Onions for 20 rupees per kilo.

89
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,245
Good quality onions. Buy it.

90
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,772
Oh God! They've spoilt my look.

91
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:58,935
Ignore this insult.
It's not yet over for us.

92
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:00,383
Tell me something.

93
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,540
Why did you suddenly
want to become a detective?

94
00:07:03,736 --> 00:07:05,325
It was not a rash decision.

95
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:06,596
We were taught..

96
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,622
..'The Hound of the Bhaskarvilles'
in our English class in school.

97
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:14,178
It's not 'Bhaskar' it's 'Basker',
Hound of Bhaskarvilles.

98
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:15,973
That's our car.

99
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:17,390
Go and open the door quickly.

100
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:20,059
Hey tomato seller.

101
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:21,162
Get lost from here.

102
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:22,405
You're disturbing me doing business hours.

103
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:25,692
Have you been squashed?

104
00:07:25,772 --> 00:07:26,621
I told you to open the door.

105
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:27,962
Sorry, sir.
- Take some fresh tomatoes.

106
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:28,989
Hey! Good joke.

107
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:33,734
I told you to open this door.

108
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:36,113
Sorry, sir.
- Get in.

109
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,642
Where's the driver?

110
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:43,864
Has he gone out to have a cup of tea?

111
00:07:45,571 --> 00:07:46,912
Call him.

112
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:50,977
Who'll drive if the driver doesn't come?

113
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:57,345
Shall we go now, sir?
- Yes, start.

114
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,231
Sneha..
- Yes, sir.

115
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:14,090
I'll prescribe the
dose for the next ten days.

116
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,458
You must watch 'The Shawshank
Redemption' daily in empty stomach.

117
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,605
In breakfast you must watch
'The Silence of the Lambs'.

118
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:22,653
And half an hour before lunch watch 'L.A.
Confidential'.

119
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:24,145
And 'Shutter Island' after dinner.

120
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:26,665
Follow this diet for ten days.

121
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:30,123
When we'll watch thriller
and suspense movies next month..

122
00:08:30,203 --> 00:08:32,091
..you'll have to guess the murderer
within first ten minutes of the film..

123
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:33,962
This is your homework.
- Hmm.

124
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:35,443
Good.
- Okay, sir.

125
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:39,043
Where are we going?

126
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:39,950
I heard somebody died.

127
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,675
Sshh.. don't discuss crime inside the ar.

128
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:44,761
We'll discuss it after
we get out of the car.

129
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,491
Have casual conversation inside the car.
- Okay.

130
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:49,215
We'll start discussing the
crime as soon as we get out of the car.

131
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:50,134
Stay casual now.

132
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:53,529
Very good. Good.

133
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:54,880
What's up?

134
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,821
Look around.

135
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:57,875
Did you have breakfast?

136
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:00,145
I had idli and medu vada
for breakfast today.

137
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:02,059
Medu vada is my favourite.

138
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:04,956
I travel long distances
to eat delicious food.

139
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:08,004
A street food vendor sets up his stall
outside Murli Hotel near Gandhiji's statue.

140
00:09:08,253 --> 00:09:11,842
He makes delicious medu vadas. Fantastic!

141
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:14,199
I also know this place.
- Really?

142
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:17,485
My friends and I would spend our
entire day there when we were in college.

143
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:21,906
The vendor came everyday at
4 pm and I was his first customer.

144
00:09:22,123 --> 00:09:23,150
Do you know what happened once?

145
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:25,940
Once my friends and I bunked
class and went to have medu vada.

146
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,874
But, I met my uncle there.

147
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,690
What happened after that?
Your uncle thrashed you?

148
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,652
The girl's name is Sanjana.

149
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,149
It's believed that she
committed suicide at night.

150
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:40,587
I told you that we'll have
a casual conversation inside the car.

151
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,966
But, the moment we step out
of the car we'll discuss the case.

152
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:44,112
Let's go.

153
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,360
Brother, what are you doing here?
- FBI.

154
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,312
FBI?
- FBI?

155
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:43,801
It's a well-planned murder.

156
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:45,725
How can you be sure, sir?

157
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:48,536
Look at the suicide note on the table.
It's kept on the left.

158
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:51,001
While other books and
notes are kept on the right.

159
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:52,827
The pen is on the left
side of the notebook.

160
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:56,450
The table lamp is on the right
and the food items, phone, cold drink.

161
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,941
Chocolates are on the left.

162
00:10:58,612 --> 00:10:59,725
She was left handed.

163
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:01,217
Then why did she hold
the gun in the right hand?

164
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:03,985
The girl done all her
work with the left hand.

165
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:07,844
Then why did she shoot
herself with her right hand?

166
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,292
Point number two.

167
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:11,259
She may have shot herself
with her right hand.

168
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,313
Why didn't the gun fall
down from her hand when she fell?

169
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:16,351
She might have held the gun
tightly as she was in a state of shock.

170
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:17,756
In that case the finger
should be on the trigger.

171
00:11:17,983 --> 00:11:19,475
The pistol has been placed on her hand.

172
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:21,529
Point number three.

173
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:26,200
Smokers have the habit of throwing
away the butt only after finishing it.

174
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,227
Especially the depressed people.

175
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,049
But this girl shot herself
after finishing half the cigarette.

176
00:11:30,276 --> 00:11:32,398
She may have shot herself after
smoking only half the cigarette..

177
00:11:32,478 --> 00:11:34,181
..but in that case the cigarette
would've got burnt by now.

178
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,046
But, it didn't.

179
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:36,646
She still has a cigarette in her hand.

180
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,236
This means somebody else was smoking and..

181
00:11:38,316 --> 00:11:40,636
..it was placed on her
hand after she was killed.

182
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,343
The most interesting point
is that she is not a smoker.

183
00:11:45,144 --> 00:11:46,787
This is the only cigarette in the house.

184
00:11:47,262 --> 00:11:48,657
There isn't a single cigarette
anywhere in the house.

185
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:51,338
Check the dustbin,
there are no cigarette butts, no ash tray.

186
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:52,420
There's no smell of cigarette.

187
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,015
Every room is clean except this room.

188
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,237
Point number four.

189
00:11:56,593 --> 00:11:58,031
The ills for depression kept on the table.

190
00:11:58,111 --> 00:11:59,847
The medicines have expired a year ago.

191
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:02,345
If a middle class girl
wanted to commit suicide then..

192
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:03,685
..why didn't she hang herself by the fan?

193
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:05,740
Why did she buy a pistol?

194
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,854
The pistol, anti-depressant pills,
cigarette, this dirty room.

195
00:12:10,934 --> 00:12:13,503
The suicide note,
all these have been kept here..

196
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,746
..to make everybody believe
that she was depressed and..

197
00:12:14,826 --> 00:12:15,892
..she committed suicide.

198
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:20,789
This is not a suicide.
It is a cold blooded murder.

199
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:23,070
Sir, you're a genius.

200
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:26,822
Hello, sir.

201
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:28,022
Who are you?

202
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:30,346
Sir, this looks like a suicide
but it's actually a murder.

203
00:12:30,426 --> 00:12:31,405
Come, I'll explain.

204
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,552
Don't act smart.

205
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:36,336
We also know that this is a murder case.

206
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,833
Her friend has confessed
that he killed her for money.

207
00:12:38,913 --> 00:12:40,195
You must've thrashed the
suspect and made him confess.

208
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:41,893
But, I guessed everything
by inspecting the crime scene.

209
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:46,281
Tell me something.

210
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:47,406
How did you come inside?

211
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:49,384
We didn't invite anybody for inauguration.

212
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,297
But, you cut the ribbon and came inside.

213
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,757
Look at your hat, overcoat and clothes.

214
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:58,584
It seems as if you've
come here for interrogation.

215
00:12:58,664 --> 00:13:02,044
Who are you?
- FBI.

216
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:04,303
FBI? But, that's in America.

217
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,665
They copied the name from me.

218
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:07,676
Fatima Bureau of Investigation.

219
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,908
Fatima was my first girlfriend.

220
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:16,021
I named my bureau Fatima
Bureau of Investigation after her.

221
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:18,291
It was a long name
so I like to call it FBI.

222
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:19,750
It sounds very impressive.

223
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,426
When you go to America and
hear about FBI you can say that..

224
00:13:21,506 --> 00:13:23,944
..there's FBI in Nellore.

225
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:26,161
I give discount to policemen.

226
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,668
Where shall I put in my card?

227
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:30,063
Forget it.

228
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,031
Let's go.

229
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,593
We solved the case together.

230
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:36,506
This calls for a selfie.

231
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:40,549
Nice #MurderSolved,
feeling excited.

232
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:41,792
Sir, are you on social media?

233
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:42,960
Shall I tag you?

234
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,214
I would've fallen down.

235
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,479
Do you still need to fall down after this?

236
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,122
You've already fallen down.
- Okay.

237
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:01,651
Do you want coffee?

238
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:07,414
I didn't fall down, I was about to fall.

239
00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:20,657
Did they thrash you badly, sir?

240
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:24,192
When we were eating
medu vada uncle caught us.

241
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:28,775
Oh! Okay. So, uncle caught you that day.
- Yes.

242
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:31,239
What happened after that?
- What else?

243
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:33,931
He tied me to a tree
and thrashed me badly.

244
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:35,585
So, you're used to getting thrashed.

245
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:41,649
Focus on the road.

246
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:46,611
Hey! Watch out, blind fellow.

247
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,580
Look.. look at them.

248
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,239
They fooled a detective like Tom Hanks.

249
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,001
These things are common
in a detective's life.

250
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:07,315
They get betrayed and also thrashed.

251
00:15:07,395 --> 00:15:08,602
The way you were thrashed today.

252
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:09,596
What did you say?

253
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,061
Got it, sir.
- What?

254
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:13,629
Whatever you were explaining.

255
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,710
Don't act smart.
It's my job to act smart. Got it?

256
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:18,310
What kind of clothes are these?

257
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,164
Why are you wearing these specs?

258
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:20,299
I don't want you to dress
like this from tomorrow.

259
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:22,667
I told you that detective
should be stylish.

260
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:25,348
Hat, coat,
band aid on the forehead are necessary.

261
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:27,596
Do you've an account in social media?
- Yes.

262
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:32,472
Do something.
Login and find my page FBI Nellore.

263
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:33,650
Like the page.

264
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:36,266
Sir, only two people have liked your page.

265
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:40,373
One is you and other
one is Sherlock Holmes.

266
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:41,368
Yes!

267
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,616
I made a fake account in Sherlock
Holmes' name and liked the page.

268
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:47,151
He's God for us.

269
00:15:47,422 --> 00:15:49,627
Our reputation will improve
if he likes our page.

270
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:50,633
Oh!

271
00:15:50,713 --> 00:15:51,930
Do you've a passport size photo?

272
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,487
Yes sir.
- Bring it tomorrow.

273
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:55,270
I'll make FBI ID card for you.

274
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:57,594
You'll join work from tomorrow.
- Okay, sir.

275
00:15:57,811 --> 00:15:58,751
Let's go.

276
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:01,628
Sir.. sir.. I want to ask you something.

277
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:02,287
What do you want to know?

278
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:03,855
Can we put a tube-light here?

279
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:05,639
The place will look brighter and nice.

280
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:07,801
No, a dark place suits our profession.

281
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:10,201
We should not only work hard
but maintain the office environment.

282
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:11,672
Oh! What a logic!

283
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,061
Remember one more thing.
- What is it, sir?

284
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,488
Don't irritate me by
calling me sir all the time.

285
00:16:15,568 --> 00:16:17,034
Then how shall I address you, sir?

286
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:47,725
'This shutter, my house, my abode.'

287
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:49,195
Agent.
- Yes.

288
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,817
I've brought home made snacks for you.

289
00:16:50,897 --> 00:16:51,465
Keep it there.

290
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,389
I'll have it after I finish work.
- You can work later.

291
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:55,843
What's our plan today?

292
00:16:56,805 --> 00:16:58,254
Plan?
- Yes.

293
00:16:58,492 --> 00:16:59,444
We're a new company.

294
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:01,076
We aren't going to get cases every day.

295
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,979
We didn't have a case even yesterday.

296
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:04,373
We barged inside the crime scene.

297
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,751
What did you say?
- Nothing, sir.

298
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,698
We'll soon get a big case.

299
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:10,904
Let's solve some ordinary cases till then.

300
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,623
We'll have regular income.

301
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:14,504
What do you mean by ordinary cases?

302
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:15,682
We've got one.

303
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:16,547
Pass the box quickly.

304
00:17:16,627 --> 00:17:17,855
Shut up! I'll thrash you.

305
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:18,687
Sir, I'm speaking the truth.

306
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:19,530
Hello, sir.

307
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,962
Agent, what's up?
- Everything is fine by your grace.

308
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:22,937
Take a seat. What's the case?

309
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:25,802
A theft has taken place in
the temple in the neighbourhood.

310
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:28,591
The priest saw these two
fellows roaming around the temple.

311
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:30,884
He's blaming him and vice versa.

312
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:32,840
I want to know who the real thief is.

313
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:34,343
Don't worry, sir. It's simple case.

314
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,214
Who stole from the temple?

315
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:38,192
Sir, I didn't steal. He is the thief.

316
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:41,240
Sir, he's the thief.
- Okay.

317
00:17:42,754 --> 00:17:43,867
Take this. Don't open this now.

318
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:45,435
Do something.

319
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:47,976
Choose one finger.

320
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:50,592
One finger is for the thief
and the other one for the innocent.

321
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:52,593
The one who chooses the
finger of the thief is the thief.

322
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,528
You're in great hurry.

323
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,269
You've chosen the finger of the thief.

324
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:57,663
Why did you steal?

325
00:17:57,858 --> 00:17:58,842
Sir, I didn't steal.

326
00:17:58,922 --> 00:18:00,419
Sir, he's the thief.
- No sir, I didn't steal.

327
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:02,679
He's in hurry because he's nervous.

328
00:18:02,906 --> 00:18:04,852
He thought that he would hold
the finger first as it would give him..

329
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,506
..the chance to escape.

330
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:08,236
So, he chose the finger quickly.

331
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:11,403
The innocent doesn't
know what he should choose.

332
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:13,565
The story is really impressive.

333
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:16,246
I went to the temple
last night to offer prayers.

334
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:18,603
But, you announced that I'm the
thief just because I hold your finger.

335
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:20,711
You're right.

336
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:24,149
I don't know why I feel
that you're speaking the truth.

337
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:26,786
You don't look like a thief.

338
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,570
I think I saw you outside
Leela Mahal theatre.

339
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,975
Did you go there last night?
- Yes, sir.

340
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:33,294
Did you go there to watch a film?
- Yes, sir.

341
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:34,505
You booked a balcony seat. Right?
- Yes, sir.

342
00:18:34,585 --> 00:18:35,856
You parked the vehicle in
the basement and went up. Right?

343
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:36,633
Yes, sir.

344
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:38,104
I told you that I didn't steal.

345
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,266
Sir, he's the thief.
- Sir..

346
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,984
Leela Mahal theatre has been
shut down for weeks for renovation.

347
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:46,925
What were you doing there?
- Sir.. well..

348
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:49,381
Did you go there to watch a
film on the cell phones of the workers?

349
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,618
Yes, sir.

350
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:54,385
These shameless people
steal inside a temple.

351
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:55,542
Sir, arrest him. He's the thief.

352
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:56,915
You can go.
- Sir..

353
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:58,699
I'll teach you a good lesson.
- Sir..

354
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,466
Come with me.
- Sir, I've solved the case.

355
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:02,515
Let's take a selfie.

356
00:19:02,595 --> 00:19:03,445
This calls for a selfie.

357
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:05,002
You also join us.

358
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:08,256
Why are you smiling?

359
00:19:08,472 --> 00:19:10,007
Make a face like that of a thief,
shameless fellow.

360
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:13,790
Okay, sir.
- Yes.

361
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,272
Thank you.
- Thank you.

362
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:18,147
Sir, payment?
- How much?

363
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:21,326
The theft took place in
the temple so give me 1100 rupees.

364
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:23,121
But, he stole 500 rupees.

365
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:26,817
Take 11 rupees.
It's considered a lucky number.

366
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,146
Come on.
- Sir..

367
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:30,362
Get some important cases for me.
You always bring trivial cases.

368
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:32,114
I got this case after much difficulty.

369
00:19:32,194 --> 00:19:34,103
Sir, leave me. I will give you money.
- How much?

370
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:35,801
I gave you a chit of paper. Right?
- Hmm..

371
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:36,958
Open it.

372
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:39,704
How?

373
00:19:39,784 --> 00:19:41,271
I knew it.

374
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,958
A criminal maybe confident but
he's always scared of getting caught.

375
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,741
The fear reflects in
the eyes of the criminal.

376
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:49,260
Not everybody can hide it,
he also couldn't.

377
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:50,925
Can't the criminals hide it?

378
00:19:51,996 --> 00:19:54,547
Do you think criminals
are very smart and intelligent?

379
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:56,590
Most of them are stupid.

380
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:59,498
You just need to read their thoughts.

381
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:01,185
How was the crime committed?

382
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,580
What are they afraid of?

383
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:06,623
If you can find the answers to
these questions you can solve any case.

384
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:10,277
Agent!

385
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:13,337
Hey Shirish!
- Sir.

386
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,509
How are you?
- Superb!

387
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:18,255
I haven't met you for years.

388
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:21,401
The crime reporter's job is so stressful.

389
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:23,443
I'm always busy writing articles.

390
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:25,606
When I get some time..

391
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:27,811
Do you remember my Guru at the NGO?

392
00:20:28,114 --> 00:20:29,736
I go there.
- Oh!

393
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,255
Today the NGO is closed
so I came to meet you.

394
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:33,617
Lucky me.

395
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,017
Shall we go out for a coffee.
- Let's go.

396
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:37,812
Anna, serve me coffee in this.

397
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:40,514
How's life?
- The same routine life. Busy life.

398
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:44,384
What are you doing these days?
Any interesting case?

399
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:45,336
It's also the usual life for me.

400
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,314
Hey Shirish! I met you after a long time.

401
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:48,190
What are you doing these days?

402
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,531
I am a bit busy.

403
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:50,774
What are you doing in my locality?

404
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:52,190
I came here to meet my friend.

405
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,773
Agent Sai Srinivas Atreya.
- Hello, sir.

406
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:56,914
Agent? Are you a LIC agent?

407
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:58,979
I've heard about a
good life insurance policy.

408
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,395
What do you suggest? Should I opt for it?

409
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:04,838
He's not a LIC agent,
he's a detective agent.

410
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:07,346
He's a detective?
- Yes, a detective.

411
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:08,287
What do you exactly mean?
- Well..

412
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,217
I'll explain.

413
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:12,536
Sir, has the construction
work in your house over or not?

414
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:14,849
What do you mean?
- Don't say that, sir.

415
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:19,033
Sir, don't you park your
green scooter AP262473 here?

416
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:22,514
You buy a newspaper and take
the 10:30 bus from that stop..

417
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:23,390
..and go to office.

418
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,374
You're going to office at 11 am
which means you're a government employee.

419
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:29,844
There's only one government
office in this bus route. PWD.

420
00:21:30,384 --> 00:21:32,190
You've a pen in your pocket
along with a calculator.

421
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:34,470
Are you accounts supervisor at PWD?

422
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:36,816
You get a salary of 15000
but you own two cell phones and..

423
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,433
..one of them is an iPhone which
you've hidden in your back pocket.

424
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,114
You're taking a lot of bribes these days.

425
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:44,644
You leave your work
incomplete and come back..

426
00:21:44,724 --> 00:21:46,309
..to this bus stand sharp at 6 pm.

427
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,449
You disappear somewhere between 6-8 pm.

428
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:50,460
When you come back to
this shop again at 8 pm..

429
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,438
..there's dust and mud from
construction site on your shoes.

430
00:21:52,518 --> 00:21:56,038
You order a tea and a smoke
and call your wife to tell her..

431
00:21:56,118 --> 00:21:57,973
'Okay, darling.
I'm stuck in my office work.'

432
00:21:58,053 --> 00:21:59,130
'I'll be home in half an hour.'

433
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,362
Sir, madam doesn't know
about the construction site.

434
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:06,189
You're building a second home.
You have a second phone.

435
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:09,627
But, you take your scooter
from the parking, buy flowers..

436
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:11,670
..and go back home as a loving husband.

437
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,503
Am I right, sir?

438
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,330
How do you know all this?

439
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:16,427
Sir, don't you drink tea here every day?

440
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:18,373
Bro, do you know him?
- No, I don't.

441
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:19,486
Do you know why?
- Why?

442
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:21,075
That's because he runs a tea stall.

443
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:24,286
You buy newspaper from
this stall daily. Right?

444
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:27,281
Grandpa, do you know him?
- I don't know him.

445
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:29,443
Why?
- That's because he sells newspaper.

446
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:31,681
But, how do I know everything about you?

447
00:22:31,854 --> 00:22:33,573
That's because you're a detective.

448
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:37,680
I hope now you know
what kind of agent I am.

449
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,643
Yes, sir.

450
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,193
Get lost. The 10:30 bus has come.

451
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:54,102
Sir..
- Yes.

452
00:22:54,383 --> 00:22:58,620
From your appearance I
think that you're an atheist.

453
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,355
Somebody has kept lemons on the road.
Be careful.

454
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:05,539
Convey my greetings to madam.
Bye, sir. Go.

455
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:08,112
He won't board the bus
from here from tomorrow.

456
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:10,176
Forget it.
I meet such people daily.

457
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,640
I came here to seek your help.

458
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,613
For what?

459
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:16,716
We need information
about unidentified bodies.

460
00:23:17,192 --> 00:23:19,938
At least five such dead
bodies are found in Nellore daily.

461
00:23:20,414 --> 00:23:22,316
Nobody can identify the bodies.

462
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:24,803
We don't know if they were
murdered or committed suicide.

463
00:23:25,743 --> 00:23:28,316
The bodies don't match with
the ones in missing complaints.

464
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:32,478
There's a section for
unclaimed dead bodies.

465
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:33,905
They kept the bodies there for a week.

466
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:35,858
It's okay of anybody
identifies the bodies.

467
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:38,517
Or else they follow the
rules of a government hospital..

468
00:23:38,597 --> 00:23:41,967
..and perform autopsy on
the body and they're cremated.

469
00:23:47,274 --> 00:23:50,247
Actually, I want to find
the truth of these cases.

470
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:53,382
But unfortunately I'm
not getting time for this work.

471
00:23:55,004 --> 00:23:55,912
Are you interested in this case?

472
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:57,609
Inform me when you find such a body again.

473
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:00,268
You know that I'm
interested in such cases.

474
00:24:01,112 --> 00:24:02,560
Call me.
- Okay.

475
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,939
Sister, are you fine?
- Yes, Seenu. I'm fine.

476
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:08,398
What else? Everything okay?

477
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:13,760
Hello.

478
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:17,824
I'll reach in fifteen minutes.

479
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:19,186
Okay. Thanks.

480
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:20,732
I'll leave now.
- What happened?

481
00:24:20,812 --> 00:24:22,430
See you soon. It's a murder case.

482
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:27,522
Listen, the lights and fan
in the office are switched on.

483
00:24:27,602 --> 00:24:28,862
Put down the shutters at least.

484
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:34,982
He's strange.

485
00:24:44,431 --> 00:24:46,236
Has a theft taken place in your home?

486
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:48,744
Is your husband involved
in an extra marital affair?

487
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:49,923
Do you suspect him?

488
00:24:50,003 --> 00:24:51,826
Has anybody in your family been kidnapped?

00:24:51,906 --> 00:24:54,063

497
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:12,797

What do you say, Sneha?

506

Sneha!

507
00:25:36,357 --> 00:25:37,044
We'll edit this part.

508
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:40,720
Agent Sai Srinivas Atreya.

509
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,920
Sir, take this. Call me.

510
00:25:45,412 --> 00:25:46,234
FBI.

511
00:25:48,104 --> 00:25:49,293
FBI, Nellore.

512
00:25:56,428 --> 00:25:57,055
Hi.

513
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:59,876
Stop it. I'm tired.
Look behind, there's a pigeon.

514
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:01,607
Hey!

515
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,045
Stop! Stop!

516
00:26:17,899 --> 00:26:18,904
Stop!

517
00:26:19,218 --> 00:26:19,986
What are you doing?

518
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:25,045
It's very interesting.

519
00:26:26,374 --> 00:26:27,088
Do it.

520
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:31,001
Stop!

521
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:32,439
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

522
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,180
Come and do it.

523
00:27:03,228 --> 00:27:06,169
Uncle, where is mom?

524
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,665
I performed the final
rite in the afternoon.

525
00:27:18,124 --> 00:27:19,995
An ominous time was to start soon.

526
00:27:20,935 --> 00:27:26,254
It's ominous for the family to
perform final rites during this period.

527
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,222
So, I had to cremate her quickly.

528
00:27:28,302 --> 00:27:29,941
Why didn't you wait for me, uncle?

529
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,741
You performed her final
rites in my absence.

530
00:27:32,968 --> 00:27:34,709
Seenu, I didn't want to do it.

531
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:38,428
You know how the villagers
are and their customs.

532
00:27:38,508 --> 00:27:41,498
I couldn't meet my mother for
the last time because of their customs.

533
00:27:41,704 --> 00:27:44,699
You've to divide this number
with this number. Okay? Do it.

534
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:46,818
I'll divide this number with this number.

535
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:52,212
How did this happen?

536
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:58,061
Last week she went to attend
the Adi Mahotsav as she does every year.

537
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:00,926
You know the custom there.

538
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,948
Scared lines are chanted and coconut
is broken on the head of the devotees.

539
00:28:06,321 --> 00:28:08,278
She was fine after that incident.

540
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:11,521
One day she fainted in the house.

541
00:28:12,115 --> 00:28:15,132
The doctor said that the
nerves in her brain were damaged..

542
00:28:15,424 --> 00:28:17,251
..and she went into coma.

543
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:25,728
She expired within two
hours after slipping into coma.

544
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,350
Why did you let her go there?

545
00:28:35,242 --> 00:28:36,020
Leave me.

546
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:38,745
Mom..

547
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:44,853
Mom has left us.

548
00:28:50,281 --> 00:28:52,670
Stop! Where are you running? Stop!

549
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:57,297
Oh mom!
- Look you've got hurt.

550
00:28:57,377 --> 00:28:59,437
This is the reason why
I was trying to stop you.

551
00:29:30,528 --> 00:29:31,252
Yes, Shirish.

552
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:36,117
A dead body has been found
near Venkatachalam bridge near Nellore.

553
00:29:36,613 --> 00:29:37,370
What are you saying?

554
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,213
Come quickly.

555
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:40,311
Yes, I'm coming. Thanks.
- Okay, bye.

556
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:06,783
What are you doing here?

557
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:08,696
Who are you?

558
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:11,064
I hope you didn't murder this person.

559
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:13,583
Why will I kill him, sir?

560
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:15,367
I got a call and so I..

561
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:17,075
Were you sent to dispose the body?

562
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:18,848
Sir, I'm a detective.

563
00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:20,945
Arrest him.
- Hey! Corrupt policeman.

564
00:31:21,025 --> 00:31:21,951
I told you everything.

565
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:25,800
Sir, tell him that it's not
easy to arrest a famous detective.

566
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,291
I hope you know it.
- No, I don't. Arrest him.

567
00:31:31,983 --> 00:31:32,740
Sir..

568
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,810
Sir, I've checked the file.

569
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,189
Sir..
- If you want to go through it you can.

570
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:38,664
What a style! Wonderful!

571
00:31:38,744 --> 00:31:40,989
A burger in one hand
and snacks in the other.

572
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:44,103
Sir, the sound of the wafers
is like the music of Rehman.

573
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:46,352
Can you hear it? Great!

574
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,206
What nonsense is he speaking, sir?

575
00:31:47,286 --> 00:31:49,789
What a height! What an uniform!

576
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:51,033
Has he gone mad?

577
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:52,189
An inspector straight out of the films.

578
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:53,033
Sir, shall I go inside
and teach him a lesson?

579
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:53,898
Mr. Police.

580
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:54,730
I think he's mad.

581
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,492
Send this file to this address.
- Sir, I'm a detective.

582
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,508
Please..
- Okay, sir.

583
00:31:57,588 --> 00:31:58,676
Hey Shirish! What's this?

584
00:31:58,756 --> 00:32:01,984
I can't possibly tell you how
disappointed I am on your late arrival.

585
00:32:02,064 --> 00:32:04,470
Please do the needful
to get me out of this prison.

586
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,508
Thank you so, so much.

587
00:32:05,588 --> 00:32:06,870
What a bloody brilliant day!

588
00:32:07,065 --> 00:32:10,967
Sir, I'm a crime reporter.
- So what?

589
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,816
Atreya, the man you've
arrested is my friend.

590
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:16,600
Your friend has become
a friend of the other prisoners.

591
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:17,930
Do you also want to get inside with him?

592
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:22,362
Sir, he's a famous detective.

593
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:24,308
You've made a mistake.

594
00:32:24,388 --> 00:32:25,767
He must be famous in his house.

595
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:27,443
Nobody knows him except the vendors.

596
00:32:27,523 --> 00:32:28,340
How can he be famous?

597
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,383
He went there because
I gave him the information.

598
00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:31,885
So, you're a crime reporter?

599
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:33,226
I'll explain everything in your language.

600
00:32:33,421 --> 00:32:36,707
The objects found at the
crime scene are the evidence.

601
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:40,458
And the people who are present
at the crime scene like your friend..

602
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:41,810
..are suspects for me.

603
00:32:42,102 --> 00:32:44,178
I won't release him.

604
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:46,275
Get bail for him and take him with you.

605
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:47,508
The court is closed today.

606
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:48,794
We won't get a bail before tomorrow.

607
00:32:48,874 --> 00:32:50,081
Let him stay here tonight.

608
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:51,962
Don't worry, we'll take good care of him.

609
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:53,670
If he wants water we'll give him milk.

610
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,443
We'll treat him well.

611
00:32:55,637 --> 00:32:56,999
I know how to get him out.

612
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:57,713
Sneha, let's go.

613
00:32:57,793 --> 00:33:00,610
Do what you can.
Why are you disturbing me?

614
00:33:00,793 --> 00:33:02,945
Atreya, I'll be back soon.
- Do something quickly.

615
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:05,669
'The number is not reachable.'

616
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,886
Hello.
- 'The number is not reachable.'

617
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,480
It's okay.
Just one day. Right? I'll be fine.

618
00:33:17,183 --> 00:33:19,118
It's considered auspicious
if a detective gets arrested.

619
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:22,134
When a biopic will be made
on my life this jail episode..

620
00:33:22,214 --> 00:33:23,431
..will be an emotional one.

621
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:26,394
I'll try to get bail tomorrow at 10 am.

622
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:29,139
Don't worry. Everything is fine here.

623
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:30,685
Only problem is that
this person snores a lot.

624
00:33:31,755 --> 00:33:33,279
Don't worry. I'll get out
in style after I get bail tomorrow.

625
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,944
Unfortunately, your meeting time is over.

626
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:35,733
Get out of here.

627
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,150
Your biopic will also be a flop.

628
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,004
If a biopic is made on him,
he'll have to play all the characters.

629
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:41,441
Sir, that's a fact.

630
00:33:42,944 --> 00:33:45,279
How long will you lie to me?

631
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:47,863
I've gone bankrupt paying your fees.

632
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,155
When will u get bail?
- I'm trying my best.

633
00:33:50,235 --> 00:33:52,706
I'll get you bailed out in a week.
Trust me.

634
00:33:52,889 --> 00:33:55,214
I don't know when that day will come.

635
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:56,479
What happened, bro?

636
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,506
Nothing, bro.

637
00:33:57,586 --> 00:33:59,635
There was a theft
in my village last month.

638
00:33:59,715 --> 00:34:01,733
The thief escaped and I was caught.

639
00:34:01,926 --> 00:34:03,224
They put me behind the bars.

640
00:34:03,304 --> 00:34:05,040
I didn't steal.

641
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,127
I asked the lawyer to get bail for me.

642
00:34:07,207 --> 00:34:09,592
He comes every week and
asks me to wait for a week.

643
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,781
Do something.

644
00:34:10,954 --> 00:34:13,419
Tell your lawyer that you
weren't in the village that day.

645
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:14,543
Who will believe this?

646
00:34:14,623 --> 00:34:17,305
Tell him that you went to hear
the sermons of Sai Baba in Chennai.

647
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,608
Get the accommodation bill
of a lodge in Chennai along..

648
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:22,213
..with the food bill
of any adjoining restaurant.

649
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,527
Take a couple of tickets from
a cinema hall next to that place.

650
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:27,154
Buy fake tickets of private
bus journey to and from Chennai.

651
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:30,190
Collect this evidence
and make a fake story.

652
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:34,255
You can easily prove that you were in
Chennai that day and not in the village.

653
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,634
You're great, sir.
- Thanks.

654
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:38,493
Tell your lawyer to stop reading books.

655
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:40,612
It's important to watch films.

656
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:44,006
How can they become lawyers
without watching films?

657
00:34:44,086 --> 00:34:45,391
Sir.. sir.. please help me get bail.

658
00:34:45,471 --> 00:34:47,391
Don't call me sir. Call me agent.

659
00:34:47,693 --> 00:34:50,472
Agent Sai Srinivas Atreya.

660
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:51,574
Come on.

661
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,596
Stand in a queue.
- Sir.. sir..

662
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,947
He.. he.. he..and also he..

663
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,563
Everybody will be bailed
out by agent Atreya.

664
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:03,477
What did you do, bro?

665
00:35:03,557 --> 00:35:08,914
I stole a vada.
- You've witness, prepare him.

666
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:11,855
He never thought that he
would be able to get out of jail.

667
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:14,158
Stand in a queue. Don't fight.

668
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:16,807
It's written all over his
face that he'll commit crime again.

669
00:35:16,887 --> 00:35:18,764
You're not ashamed of stealing. Right?

670
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:20,364
Sir..
- Yes.

671
00:35:20,444 --> 00:35:22,720
..this food is awful.
Get some food from a nice hotel.

672
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,860
Quietly at whatever
you've been given. Got it?

673
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:28,190
Go inside.

674
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,352
There's a new one.

675
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,649
Welcome, sir.

676
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:32,784
Please be seated, sir.

677
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:40,557
What are you doing here, sir?

678
00:35:50,422 --> 00:35:51,471
Hello, sir.

679
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:54,455
What do you say?

680
00:35:54,974 --> 00:35:57,558
You're quiet since you came.

681
00:35:58,087 --> 00:35:59,320
Eat something.

682
00:36:00,444 --> 00:36:01,925
What happened, sir? Any problem?

683
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,422
I can solve any problem.

684
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,347
Do you want to apply for bail?

685
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:10,628
Sir, I'm talking to you.

686
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:13,774
Okay, as you wish.

687
00:36:13,854 --> 00:36:17,298
Divya..
- Who is Divya, sir?

688
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:19,698
Divya is my daughter.

689
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,601
What happened to her?

690
00:36:22,131 --> 00:36:25,147
She would distribute
books to poor children.

691
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,655
She used to teach them.

692
00:36:27,735 --> 00:36:29,569
She would help the poor and needy.

693
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,503
She went to Ongole for
work on the 18th of this month.

694
00:36:34,054 --> 00:36:37,211
She called me at 10
in the night and told me..

695
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,342
Dad, I'm feeling very scared.

696
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:43,180
The three people won't spare me.

697
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:46,293
And her call got disconnected.

698
00:36:47,244 --> 00:36:50,282
I tried several times
to connect her but couldn't.

699
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:53,136
I was confused and didn't know what to do.

700
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:55,136
I didn't know where to go for help.

701
00:36:55,817 --> 00:37:00,282
I went to Ongole police
station with my friends that day..

702
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,401
..to register that complaint.

703
00:37:02,844 --> 00:37:06,661
The policemen informed me
that they had found a dead body.

704
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:11,796
They told me to go and identify
if it was my daughter's body.

705
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:19,731
My Divya..
it was my daughter Divya's body.

706
00:37:23,622 --> 00:37:28,055
The inspector told me that she
committed suicide for a boy she loved.

707
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:29,417
But, it was a lie.

708
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,995
Anybody could easily say
after seeing her dead body..

709
00:37:33,201 --> 00:37:36,304
..that a monster raped
and then killed her.

710
00:37:42,531 --> 00:37:46,347
The inspector refused to listen to me.

711
00:37:46,703 --> 00:37:49,363
The doctor's mentioned
in the post-mortem report that..

712
00:37:49,622 --> 00:37:51,893
..she died by hanging
herself from a ceiling fan.

713
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:57,169
Where shall I go for help?
What do I do?

714
00:37:58,098 --> 00:37:59,223
Please calm down, sir.

715
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,666
Please tell me if you doubt anybody.

716
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:04,910
Did your daughter mention
anybody's name to you?

717
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:10,510
Her phone was found next to her dead body.

718
00:38:11,516 --> 00:38:14,424
I told you that she called
me at 10 in the night.

719
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:17,504
I checked her phone records.

720
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:23,591
She got 3-4 calls from
three different numbers between..

721
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:25,180
..9 to 9:55 pm that night.

722
00:38:28,066 --> 00:38:32,693
I had doubts and so I went to Ongole police
station and showed the, the evidence.

723
00:38:32,996 --> 00:38:35,287
They said that they would
verify the numbers and tell me.

724
00:38:35,677 --> 00:38:37,471
They told me to go back later.

725
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:41,470
When I went to meet them
again they refused to accept..

726
00:38:41,957 --> 00:38:43,319
..that I gave them a phone.

727
00:38:48,421 --> 00:38:50,984
I approached the local
police station also.

728
00:38:51,383 --> 00:38:54,140
Somebody near Venkatachalam..

729
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:56,918
..had robbed people of their
money by luring them through chit fund.

730
00:38:56,998 --> 00:39:00,831
They framed me for this
fraud and got me arrested.

731
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:13,329
You mentioned that she got
repeated calls from three numbers.

732
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:16,193
Do you know who called her?

733
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,112
I don't know their names.

734
00:39:19,556 --> 00:39:21,004
But, I thought that
the numbers might help me..

735
00:39:21,084 --> 00:39:22,150
..so I noted them down.

736
00:39:22,562 --> 00:39:24,053
It's written in this paper.

737
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,551
Can I see it?
- Take it.

738
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:31,707
Do you've your daughter's photo?
- Yes.

739
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:32,853
Show me.

740
00:39:39,232 --> 00:39:41,167
I'll enquire about these numbers.

741
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:47,977
Have patience, sir. Be strong.

742
00:39:51,783 --> 00:39:55,988
When somebody very dear
to us leaves us forever..

743
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:58,669
..we just wish we could
meet and see the person just once.

744
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:02,604
But, after seeing my daughter's
dead body I prayed that..

745
00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:07,933
..no father sees his
daughter in such a condition.

746
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:13,523
Hey! Get up. You've got bail.

747
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:41,966
What's wrong, agent?
You've got bail.

748
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:43,696
Then why do you look upset?

749
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,517
I met a man in the prison last night.

750
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,755
Somebody raped his
daughter and killed her.

751
00:40:51,944 --> 00:40:54,030
When he tried to report
the crime at the police station..

752
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:56,052
..instead of registering his complaint..

753
00:40:56,132 --> 00:40:58,906
..they framed him, seized his
belongings and put him behind the bars.

754
00:40:59,317 --> 00:41:02,549
He was crying for his daughter all night.

755
00:41:02,765 --> 00:41:05,803
I was shocked to hear the condition
in which daughter's body was found.

756
00:41:08,095 --> 00:41:10,311
Just imagine how a father
feels when he hears..

757
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:14,517
..his daughter's dead body
has been found in this condition.

758
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:24,603
I always told you that
we'll get big case one day.

759
00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:26,528
This is the case.

760
00:41:26,895 --> 00:41:28,009
We'll solve this case.

761
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,430
Maruti Rao has given me three numbers.

762
00:41:31,231 --> 00:41:34,950
The people involved have used
their power to suppress the case.

763
00:41:35,145 --> 00:41:37,426
The police is also helping them.

764
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:38,961
Find out whose telephone
numbers these are.

765
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,491
Get the details.
- Okay, agent.

766
00:41:52,874 --> 00:41:55,317
They'll shift me to
another prison tomorrow.

767
00:41:55,397 --> 00:41:57,101
I'll come and meet
you there after two days.

768
00:42:01,556 --> 00:42:03,340
My name is Maruti Rao.

769
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:06,475
What's your name?
- Agent Sai.

770
00:42:07,232 --> 00:42:08,616
It's okay if you address me as Babu.

771
00:42:13,816 --> 00:42:15,719
Agent.
- What happened?

772
00:42:15,913 --> 00:42:17,643
I've got the details.
- Good.

773
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:31,502
The first number belongs
to a man named Ajay.

774
00:42:31,902 --> 00:42:35,221
Vrindavan apartment,
behind railway station, Nellore.

775
00:42:36,853 --> 00:42:37,718
Who's the second one?

776
00:42:39,729 --> 00:42:40,594
The next one.

777
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:44,507
Harsha. Who's he? RK Puram, Nellore.

778
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:46,561
Who's the third one?

779
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:49,869
No photo? This is a girl. Vasudha.

780
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:52,507
The photo of the third person
is not there in the database.

781
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:54,778
Interesting.

782
00:42:58,582 --> 00:43:00,734
Okay. Let's go to all
these three addresses.

783
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,884
Let's check if these people
live in the addresses mentioned.

784
00:43:02,964 --> 00:43:05,458
We'll ask everybody
where they were on the 18th.

785
00:43:13,426 --> 00:43:14,312
Hello, madam.

786
00:43:14,485 --> 00:43:15,923
Our bathroom is clean.

787
00:43:16,003 --> 00:43:17,545
No, I don't sell toilet cleaners.

788
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:19,080
Our clothes are already bright and clean.

789
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,658
I don't sell detergents.

790
00:43:20,738 --> 00:43:23,469
Are you from the team
that surveys the toothpaste?

791
00:43:23,549 --> 00:43:25,912
No, madam.
I'm from One Flight Courier service.

792
00:43:25,992 --> 00:43:26,658
Oh!

793
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:28,550
I've a courier for Ajay sir.

794
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,388
I've been trying to
tell you but you were..

795
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,631
He was not in town on the 18th.

796
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,080
I couldn't connect with him on phone so..

797
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,453
He doesn't stay in town on 18th.

798
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:39,058
Yes, I spoke to sir and
he told me that he went somewhere.

799
00:43:39,138 --> 00:43:41,567
He went to Ongole.
- Yes. Ongole.

800
00:43:42,183 --> 00:43:44,421
He told me that he would go to Ongole.

801
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:46,626
So, I've brought the package today.
- Okay.

802
00:43:46,706 --> 00:43:47,264
Give it to me.

803
00:43:47,344 --> 00:43:48,118
Please don't mind, madam.

804
00:43:48,198 --> 00:43:50,831
It's our company's policy that
I can give the parcel only to Ajay sir.

805
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,610
Is sir at home?

806
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,577
I told you that he's not at home,
he's in office.

807
00:43:53,657 --> 00:43:54,972
He will come late.

808
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:56,918
It's okay, madam.
I'll come back in the evening.

809
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:59,199
Okay.
- Thank you, madam. Have a good day.

810
00:43:59,447 --> 00:44:00,345
What are you thinking, agent?

811
00:44:00,425 --> 00:44:01,415
This is Ajay's house.

812
00:44:01,495 --> 00:44:03,037
He was in Ongole on 18th.

813
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,593
What shall we do now?

814
00:44:04,993 --> 00:44:06,161
I'll take out the cap first.

815
00:44:06,464 --> 00:44:08,777
I look like a toilet cleaner in this.

816
00:44:10,323 --> 00:44:12,182
Remove Ajay's address from the packet
and replace it with Harsha's address.

817
00:44:12,262 --> 00:44:13,707
I came on 18th, madam.

818
00:44:13,787 --> 00:44:16,269
He was on Ongole on 18th
and so you couldn't meet him.

819
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:19,491
Okay. I spoke with sir.

820
00:44:19,571 --> 00:44:21,232
He told me to come today, so I've come.

821
00:44:21,312 --> 00:44:22,086
Okay. He's not at home right now.

822
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:23,329
He'll back soon.
- Okay.

823
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:25,715
I've few more parcels to deliver.
I'll deliver them and come back.

824
00:44:25,795 --> 00:44:28,450
Is it okay if I come at
4-4:30 in the evening. - Okay.

825
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,899
Thank you, madam. Have a good day.

826
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,451
Harsha was also in Ongole on 18th.

827
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,315
I'm sure something happened
in Ongole that day.

828
00:44:40,163 --> 00:44:42,098
Hello, madam.
There's a courier for Vasudha madam.

829
00:44:42,178 --> 00:44:42,855
Who's Vasudha?

830
00:44:42,935 --> 00:44:44,628
I got this address for delivery.

831
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:45,871
Nobody of this name lives here.

832
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,158
Doesn't she live here?
- No.

833
00:44:47,238 --> 00:44:49,060
Are you new here?
- Yes.

834
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,450
Do you know the people
who lived here before you? - No.

835
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,126
It's okay.
Can I get the landlord's number?

836
00:44:53,206 --> 00:44:54,023
Why do you want it?

837
00:44:54,103 --> 00:44:55,828
It's an important courier.

838
00:44:56,044 --> 00:44:59,471
9030693149.

839
00:45:01,472 --> 00:45:02,932
Okay. Thanks.

840
00:45:03,169 --> 00:45:03,991
Thank you.

841
00:45:04,251 --> 00:45:05,818
call that number.
- Yes.

842
00:45:09,591 --> 00:45:11,905
'The number is not reachable.'

843
00:45:11,985 --> 00:45:13,472
It's not reachable.

844
00:45:13,552 --> 00:45:15,732
Try Vasudha's number.
- Okay.

845
00:45:17,332 --> 00:45:20,077
'The number is not reachable.'

846
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:25,104
Okay. Let's try the owner's number.

847
00:45:25,504 --> 00:45:27,266
Ajay and Harsha both
were in Ongole on 18th.

848
00:45:27,346 --> 00:45:28,488
I'm sure something happened there.

849
00:45:28,568 --> 00:45:30,693
Vasudha definitely knows about it.

850
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:33,137
You and I'll follow
Ajay and Harsha separately.

851
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:36,899
Harsha looks like a murderer.
He seems dangerous.

852
00:45:36,979 --> 00:45:40,385
For safety purpose you'll
follow him and I'll follow Ajay.

853
00:45:40,796 --> 00:45:43,217
Since police is trying to
cover up we'll trace the activities..

854
00:45:43,297 --> 00:45:45,704
..of Ajay and Harsha
for the next 2-3 days.

855
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:49,022
We need to be alert and see
where they go and whom they meet.

856
00:45:49,216 --> 00:45:53,411
We've to note down every detail
of where they go and whom they meet.

857
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:53,984
Okay?

858
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:55,378
Could you connect with Vasudha?
- She's not reachable.

859
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:56,427
What about the owner?
- Not reachable.

860
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:58,362
Keep trying their number.
It's important that we talk to them.

861
00:45:58,535 --> 00:46:00,297
Meet me outside Harsha's house at 8 am.

862
00:46:00,377 --> 00:46:02,535
But agent, I don't have a bike.

863
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,281
I suddenly remembered that
Harsha's bike is also not working.

864

871
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:28,903
How could he meet Krishna Devarai?

00:46:28,983 --> 00:46:30,179
History books are so confusing.

873
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:31,520

Agent, shall I go to his house
and tell him that I want to follow him?

00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:50,960

I've the feeling that they're connected
to the railway bridge murder also.

932
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:06,496
They look tensed as they're
trying to hide something.

933
00:53:07,242 --> 00:53:08,366
There are two points.

934
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,128

Why did she go there?

938
00:53:16,013 --> 00:53:17,111
Did she go there for a NGO activity?

939
00:53:17,191 --> 00:53:18,008
What was her work there?

940
00:53:18,088 --> 00:53:19,792
We need answers to these questions.

941
00:53:19,872 --> 00:53:21,349
Come early tomorrow morning.

Get separate bills for us.
We're not together.

945
00:53:27,754 --> 00:53:28,928
I don't know her.

946
00:53:30,312 --> 00:53:32,841
Pay the bill, get out of
here and meet me at the parking.

947
00:53:37,295 --> 00:53:40,679
Agent, it's the call from the
landlord whom we were calling yesterday.

948
00:53:46,343 --> 00:53:48,743
Sir, I'm speaking from a courier company.
- Yes, tell me.

949
00:53:48,823 --> 00:53:51,640
There's a parcel for
Vasudha madam at your address.

950
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,213
Okay.

951
00:53:52,293 --> 00:53:55,305
I met your tenants who said
that Vasudha madam didn't live there.

952
00:53:55,943 --> 00:53:58,094
What name did you mention? Vasudha?
- Yes, sir.

953
00:53:58,174 --> 00:54:00,602
The tenants came here three
months back and so they don't know her.

954
00:54:00,682 --> 00:54:03,467
Yes.
- The old tenants may know her.

955
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:05,414
A couple lived there before.

956
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:10,073
But, the girl's name wasn't Vasudha.
- Okay.

957
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:13,933
Where are the couple now?
Can you help me?

958
00:54:14,582 --> 00:54:17,241
I think they shifted to America.

959
00:54:17,674 --> 00:54:19,263
I don't have any other
knowledge about them.

960
00:54:21,014 --> 00:54:23,641
Right, sir. Thank you.
- Okay.

961
00:54:23,721 --> 00:54:24,614
Okay, sir.

962
00:54:38,388 --> 00:54:39,977
We need to find out who this person is.

963
00:54:40,896 --> 00:54:43,425
I'm sure Vasudha knows
what happened at Ongole that day.

964
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:46,528
Who killed Divya?

965
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:01,457
Divya..

966
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:04,257
Divya..

967
00:55:05,998 --> 00:55:07,176
Agent.

968
00:55:10,431 --> 00:55:11,491
Divya..

969
00:55:11,571 --> 00:55:12,496
Oh God!

970
00:55:14,074 --> 00:55:15,296
How is this possible?

971
00:55:17,566 --> 00:55:18,669
You're Divya. Right?

972
00:55:19,058 --> 00:55:20,139
Who are you?

973
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:22,897
Who is Divya?
- No.. no.. look..

974
00:55:26,602 --> 00:55:27,887
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

975
00:55:28,081 --> 00:55:28,913
What do you want?

976
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:31,818
Your dad Maruti Rao is in jail.

977
00:55:31,898 --> 00:55:33,665
He thinks that you're dead.
- Dad!

978
00:55:38,363 --> 00:55:39,907
Who is he?
Do you know him?

979
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:43,429
Is he your dad?
- Yes, he's my father.

980
00:55:44,368 --> 00:55:45,740
How is this possible?

981
00:55:46,064 --> 00:55:48,354
Sir, do you understand
what I'm trying to say?

982
00:55:48,434 --> 00:55:50,049
Please try to understand
what I want to say.

983
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:51,497
There was an attempt to rape on her.

984
00:55:51,577 --> 00:55:53,895
She is my daughter. What are you saying?

985
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,461
Sorry.
- Please talk with due respect.

986
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:56,693
Sorry.

987
00:55:56,773 --> 00:55:58,724
Get lost from her.
- Sorry, sir.

988
00:55:59,394 --> 00:56:01,046
Let's go, the bus is going to leave.

989
00:56:01,813 --> 00:56:02,569
Let's go.

990
00:56:04,071 --> 00:56:05,616
What were you saying?

991
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,733
She's the girl whose photo I saw.

992
00:56:08,003 --> 00:56:08,824
She is Divya.

993
00:56:08,904 --> 00:56:10,844
The photo that Maruti
Rao showed me was of this girl.

994
00:56:11,028 --> 00:56:12,810
She is alive but that poor
man thinks that she's dead.

995
00:56:12,993 --> 00:56:14,235
Are you sure?

996
00:56:28,438 --> 00:56:29,432
Come.

997
00:56:36,905 --> 00:56:38,288
Suri, see what he wants.

998
00:56:39,098 --> 00:56:43,105
Hello, sir. We've come to meet Maruti Rao.

999
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:45,319
Visiting hours are over.
Come tomorrow.

1000
00:56:46,129 --> 00:56:48,332
Sir, please help. It's urgent.

1001
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:50,816
I want to speak to him
for a couple of minutes.

1002
00:56:51,561 --> 00:56:52,566
Okay.
What name did you say?

1003
00:56:52,646 --> 00:56:53,538
Maruti Rao.

1004
00:56:59,013 --> 00:57:00,385
There's no person by this name here.

1005
00:57:00,465 --> 00:57:02,135
Maruti Rao, sir. He's an aged man.

1006
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:04,824
He has been transferred from
rural police station to sub-jail.

1007
00:57:04,904 --> 00:57:06,067
Please check again.

1008
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:17,808
Nobody has been brought
here from the village..

1009
00:57:17,888 --> 00:57:18,866
..in the last three days.

1010
00:57:19,298 --> 00:57:20,152
Nobody was brought here?

1011
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:21,804
I said it. Don't you understand?

1012
00:57:33,631 --> 00:57:34,928
You are so coward.

1013
00:57:35,008 --> 00:57:36,504
'Somebody has been giving me
death threats for the last few days.'

1014
00:57:36,584 --> 00:57:37,617
Stop! Where are you going?

1015
00:57:37,697 --> 00:57:38,805
I want to talk to sir.
- He's busy, talk later.

1016
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:40,327
It's urgent.
- Sit here.

1017
00:57:40,407 --> 00:57:42,865
'Somebody has been giving me
death threats for the last few days.'

1018
00:57:42,945 --> 00:57:44,593
Detective, sit down quietly.

1019
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:47,110
'Sir, I don't know who's doing this.'

1020
00:57:47,315 --> 00:57:48,741
'Doesn't matter, come tomorrow.'

1021
00:57:48,821 --> 00:57:51,409
Sir, please make it quick.
- No. Wait here.

1022
00:57:51,895 --> 00:57:53,256
'Okay, let's go. We'll come tomorrow.'

1023
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:54,584
Send the agent.
- Go.

1024
00:57:54,779 --> 00:57:55,643
Thank you.

1025
00:57:58,246 --> 00:57:58,786
Hello.

1026
00:57:59,186 --> 00:57:59,920
So, you're back.

1027
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,638
The second incarnation of Sherlock Holmes.

1028
00:58:01,821 --> 00:58:03,074
Didn't you get burger for me?

1029
00:58:03,154 --> 00:58:04,953
Help me and I'll definitely
get burgers for you.

1030
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:06,843
You arrested Maruti Rao few days back.

1031
00:58:07,395 --> 00:58:08,918
But, you didn't; transfer him to sub-jail.

1032
00:58:08,998 --> 00:58:11,132
Maruti Rao? Who is he?

1033
00:58:11,445 --> 00:58:15,031
Maruti Rao, sir, the old man
who was crying inside the lock-up.

1034
00:58:15,111 --> 00:58:16,521
He was dressed in loincloth and shirt.

1035
00:58:16,601 --> 00:58:19,232
His name was Gopalam and not Maruti Rao.

1036
00:58:19,459 --> 00:58:21,295
He was creating a ruckus
after getting drunk.

1037
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:22,721
We arrested him for a night
and released him next morning.

1038
00:58:22,801 --> 00:58:24,320
Who is Gopalam? His name was Maruti Rao.

1039
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:29,839
Was he arrested for creating
ruckus in a drunk state?

1040
00:58:30,833 --> 00:58:31,610
Tell him.

1041
00:58:32,312 --> 00:58:34,937
Sir, please give me his address.
- Address?

1042
00:58:35,229 --> 00:58:37,551
A VIP wants his address, give it to him.

1043
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:38,966
Do you think we've nothing
better to do than note down..

1044
00:58:39,046 --> 00:58:40,327
..the address of every drunk person?

1045
00:58:41,029 --> 00:58:43,794
Get out. Get out.

1046
00:58:45,846 --> 00:58:46,710
Hey!

1047
00:58:50,705 --> 00:58:52,293
The police is hiding something from us.

1048
00:58:55,609 --> 00:58:57,661
I spoke with Maruti Rao that day.

1049
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:01,215
I saw the pain in his eyes, Sneha.

1050
00:59:02,964 --> 00:59:05,956
Why don't we go to Ongole
police station and get information?

1051
00:59:08,473 --> 00:59:11,000
He said that the case
was registered at Ongole.

1052
00:59:12,167 --> 00:59:13,215
Let's go to Ongole.

1053
00:59:13,295 --> 00:59:15,267
Agent, I need to go home.

1054
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:16,877
My mom has been repeatedly calling me.

1055
00:59:16,957 --> 00:59:18,907
Okay, you go home. I'll come with the car.

1056
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,434
Tell your mom that we'll go to Ongole.

1057
00:59:24,308 --> 00:59:25,128
Where were you?

1058
00:59:25,323 --> 00:59:26,965
Mom needs some medicines.

1059
00:59:27,045 --> 00:59:28,628
I'll be back in a few minutes.

1060
00:59:39,623 --> 00:59:43,393
Agent, I need a week's leave.
- For what?

1061
00:59:43,473 --> 00:59:46,406
The Karni Mata festival
will start in Bikaner, Rajasthan.

1062
00:59:46,644 --> 00:59:47,378
So what?

1063
00:59:47,573 --> 00:59:50,457
It's believed that Goddess Durga
comes there in the disguise of rat.

1064
00:59:50,537 --> 00:59:54,875
My mother believes that if we can spot
a white rat it's considered very lucky.

1065
00:59:54,955 --> 00:59:57,489
We go there every week
but we couldn't go last year..

1066
00:59:57,569 --> 00:59:59,800
..as my mom was not well.

1067
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,285
Do you believe in these superstitions?

1068
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:03,689
You're an educated girl.

1069
01:00:03,992 --> 01:00:05,451
Can't you convince your mom?

1070
01:00:07,482 --> 01:00:09,588
It's not even a month that
you joined work and you want leave.

1071
01:00:09,668 --> 01:00:11,143
I'm supposed to work only from 10-5.

1072
01:00:11,223 --> 01:00:12,655
I'm already working over time.

1073
01:00:12,893 --> 01:00:15,896
I deserve leave.
- Okay.

1074
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:20,627
Agent, will anybody at
Ongole police station help us?

1075
01:00:20,707 --> 01:00:23,229
Ongole's SI is Shirish's friend.
- Oh! That's good.

1076
01:00:23,309 --> 01:00:26,286
If the case is registered there
then we'll find out who's lying.

1077
01:00:31,914 --> 01:00:33,415
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1078
01:00:33,495 --> 01:00:34,581
I'm from Nellore.

1079
01:00:34,661 --> 01:00:36,816
My friend Shirish must've called you.
- Yes. Tell me.

1080
01:00:36,896 --> 01:00:40,878
Sir, you must've registered the
death case of a girl named Divya on 18th.

1081
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:42,391
I need the detail.

1082
01:00:43,211 --> 01:00:46,344
We found a dead body
but it was a male dead body.

1083
01:00:46,424 --> 01:00:47,423
Male dead body?
- Yes.

1084
01:00:47,503 --> 01:00:48,892
We couldn't identify the body.

1085
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,861
Did we get the dead body
of a girl named Divya on 18th?

1086
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,265
How did they get a male dead body?

1087
01:00:55,345 --> 01:00:56,442
Please check and tell me.

1088
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:58,160
Do inform me if you get any information.

1089
01:00:58,505 --> 01:00:59,261
Thank you.

1090
01:00:59,434 --> 01:01:03,625
Sorry, Atreya. No complaint
registered in the name of Divya.

1091
01:01:04,501 --> 01:01:06,099
Something is definitely wrong, agent.

1092
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:09,696
I'm totally confused. I'm baffled.

1093
01:01:11,532 --> 01:01:13,077
The old man said that
the case was registered here.

1094
01:01:13,412 --> 01:01:14,535
But, they're saying that it isn't.

1095
01:01:14,615 --> 01:01:15,378
Who is lying?

1096
01:01:15,789 --> 01:01:18,230
Something is wrong.
We're making some mistake.

1097
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:19,861
The registered case is missing.

1098
01:01:19,941 --> 01:01:21,233
Maruti Rao is missing from the cell.

1099
01:01:21,313 --> 01:01:22,140
What has happened to him?

1100
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:23,998
What happened at Ongole on 18th night?

1101
01:01:24,235 --> 01:01:26,817
One evidence.. I wish I get a small clue.

1102
01:01:52,025 --> 01:01:54,531
Agent, excuse me.
I want to go to the washroom.

1103
01:01:54,611 --> 01:02:00,136
Breaking news. A woman has been robbed.

1104
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:06,055
Yes. Men riding on a bike targeted
her and escaped with her chain.

1105
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:08,777
An employee of Nellore
bank was murdered today.

1106
01:02:08,993 --> 01:02:10,959
The body of this man
was found outside the city.

1107
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:14,977
The deceased was a resident
of Nellore and his name was Ajay.

1108
01:02:15,057 --> 01:02:17,775
He has been brutally murdered.

1109
01:02:18,023 --> 01:02:22,138
His body was found near crematorium
in the outskirts of Nellore.

1110
01:02:22,462 --> 01:02:24,103
The police have started
their investigation.

1111
01:02:24,183 --> 01:02:26,912
The accused will soon be arrested.

1112
01:02:26,992 --> 01:02:30,637
The SP has promised to
arrest the murderer in 24 hours.

1113
01:02:30,864 --> 01:02:32,409
The police is investigating the case.

1114
01:02:32,489 --> 01:02:34,310
The murderer will soon
be in police custody.

1115
01:02:34,548 --> 01:02:37,097
Stay tuned for more news.

1116
01:02:40,942 --> 01:02:43,556
Mr. Srinivas Atreya.
- Yes.

1117
01:02:43,815 --> 01:02:46,548
You're under arrest.
- For what?

1118
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,432
For killing a bank employee named Ajay.

1119
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,653
Concentrate on your breathing.

1120
01:03:08,626 --> 01:03:10,030
Lift your little finger.

1121
01:03:10,257 --> 01:03:11,542
This one? Can't I use some other finger?

1122
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:13,255
Stop the nonsense.

1123
01:03:13,903 --> 01:03:16,575
Place your little finger
on one side of the nose.

1124
01:03:16,852 --> 01:03:19,120
Take a deep breath.

1125
01:03:20,557 --> 01:03:21,745
Breathe.

1126
01:03:21,825 --> 01:03:22,847
Atreya.

1127
01:03:23,322 --> 01:03:24,651
Breathe out.
- Atreya.

1128
01:03:24,845 --> 01:03:26,217
Will I be able to get
out of jail if I do this?

1129
01:03:26,297 --> 01:03:29,641
I don't know if you'll get out of jail,
but I'm sure you'll be stress free.

1130
01:03:29,721 --> 01:03:30,742
What's going on?

1131
01:03:30,822 --> 01:03:32,157
I'm enjoying the air inside the jail,
my friend.

1132
01:03:32,237 --> 01:03:32,794
Okay.

1133
01:03:32,874 --> 01:03:35,419
The police arrested you and you're
not taking any action against them.

1134
01:03:35,499 --> 01:03:36,251
What shall I tell them?

1135
01:03:36,331 --> 01:03:37,807
Say that you're innocent.

1136
01:03:37,887 --> 01:03:40,237
Do you know what they
said when I asked them?

1137
01:03:40,475 --> 01:03:41,955
They said that you're
busy doing yoga here.

1138
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:46,492
The CCTV footage of the hospital,
bank ATM, car rental agency..

1139
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:49,019
..will prove easily
that I was following Ajay.

1140
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:52,021
Ajay's washer-man or security
guard will also identify me.

1141
01:03:52,101 --> 01:03:55,272
The day Ajay was killed in was
following him in different disguises.

1142
01:03:55,352 --> 01:03:56,342
And there's proof.

1143
01:03:56,422 --> 01:04:00,208
You want me to tell the
police that I'm innocent.

1144
01:04:00,288 --> 01:04:01,591
They'll torture me badly.

1145
01:04:02,044 --> 01:04:03,567
So, I didn't say anything.

1146
01:04:04,388 --> 01:04:07,952
I'm the prime suspect in the preliminary
investigation of Ajay's murder.

1147
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:14,076
I know this very well but who killed Ajay.

1148
01:04:15,177 --> 01:04:16,895
Ajay and Harsha..

1149
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,718
Harsha..

1150
01:04:22,478 --> 01:04:23,451
Where's Harsha?

1151
01:04:24,714 --> 01:04:25,405
I don't know, agent.

1152
01:04:25,485 --> 01:04:27,533
Wasn't Harsha questioned
when Ajay was found dead?

1153
01:04:27,717 --> 01:04:29,164
No.
- Call Harsha now.

1154
01:04:33,593 --> 01:04:35,224
He's not taking the call.
- That's it.

1155
01:04:36,693 --> 01:04:38,734
Ajay and Harsha had an
argument outside the restaurant.

1156
01:04:38,814 --> 01:04:41,434
Yes.
- Ajay was killed and Harsha is missing.

1157
01:04:41,672 --> 01:04:43,994
Do anything to find out where Harsha is.

1158
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:46,230
Harsha is the prime
suspect in Ajay's murder.

1159
01:04:46,403 --> 01:04:47,083
Quick.
- Okay.

1160
01:04:47,163 --> 01:04:47,861
Okay, agent.

1161
01:04:51,371 --> 01:04:52,462
Is Harsha at home?

1162
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,658
When will you get his body?

1163
01:04:57,738 --> 01:04:58,965
Police verification is going on.

1164
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:00,812
It'll take time.
- Okay.

1165
01:05:08,966 --> 01:05:10,932
Somebody killed Ajay
and Harsha ruthlessly.

1166
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:14,917
Their belongings were checked
to identify their bodies.

1167
01:05:15,414 --> 01:05:18,611
All of their body parts
haven't been recovered yet.

1168
01:05:19,205 --> 01:05:20,371
Only the murder weapon has been found..

1169
01:05:20,451 --> 01:05:24,065
..which has your finger prints on it.

1170
01:05:24,432 --> 01:05:25,232
My finger prints?

1171
01:05:25,312 --> 01:05:26,009
That's not all.

1172
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:27,867
They've found drugs
at Ajay and Harsha's house.

1173
01:05:29,271 --> 01:05:31,712
And the same drug has
been found in your house.

1174
01:05:31,792 --> 01:05:32,360
What?

1175
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,876
The case against you has become strong.

1176
01:05:36,356 --> 01:05:38,279
They're connecting
this case with drug mafia.

1177
01:05:38,359 --> 01:05:40,363
The police believe that this
is the reason you killed them.

1178
01:05:40,796 --> 01:05:43,118
It'll be published and telecast
in every newspaper and channel tomorrow.

1179
01:05:43,198 --> 01:05:44,436
You're famous now. Happy?

1180
01:05:44,516 --> 01:05:45,807
Just a second. Just a second.
- I warned you.

1181
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,625
Maruti Rao came in my
cell the day I got arrested.

1182
01:05:51,488 --> 01:05:54,577
I took up this case when he
told me about his daughter. Right?

1183
01:05:54,901 --> 01:05:55,992
I didn't know anything.

1184
01:05:56,338 --> 01:05:57,753
I thought I am helping him.

1185
01:05:57,833 --> 01:06:00,194
I thought that my agency will
become popular if I solve this case.

1186
01:06:00,441 --> 01:06:03,250
I was happy that I got an
important case after a long time.

1187
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:05,031
I didn't get the case.

1188
01:06:05,496 --> 01:06:07,375
The case found us.

1189
01:06:08,282 --> 01:06:09,481
Think about it.

1190
01:06:10,227 --> 01:06:11,274
What was I doing?

1191
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:14,460
I was following Ajay and Harsha
so that I could solve the case.

1192
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:15,378
But, nothing happened.

1193
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:17,052
The investigation wasn't successful.

1194
01:06:17,571 --> 01:06:21,167
They fooled me at every
step to plant evidence against me.

1195
01:06:21,361 --> 01:06:24,180
That knife was fallen on the streets.

1196
01:06:24,461 --> 01:06:25,627
I picked it up and kept it in its place.

1197
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:28,468
They must've got my
finger prints from there.

1198
01:06:29,484 --> 01:06:30,607
What's the murder weapon?

1199
01:06:31,115 --> 01:06:32,378
A billhook machete used to cut coconuts.

1200
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:33,318
That's it.

1201
01:06:33,847 --> 01:06:36,299
They planned Ajay and Harsha's murder.

1202
01:06:36,656 --> 01:06:41,095
They want to frame me for this
murder and make me the scapegoat.

1203
01:06:41,451 --> 01:06:42,823
The old man's name isn't Maruti Rao.

1204
01:06:42,996 --> 01:06:43,914
His name is Gopalam.

1205
01:06:44,389 --> 01:06:47,500
Gopalam lied to me.

1206
01:06:47,673 --> 01:06:48,742
Atreya, listen to me.

1207
01:06:49,347 --> 01:06:50,795
These people seem to be very dangerous.

1208
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:52,804
I'll try my best to bail you out.

1209
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:53,797
You're not Sherlock Holmes.

1210
01:06:53,877 --> 01:06:54,867
So, please forget this case.

1211
01:06:54,947 --> 01:06:56,778
Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character..

1212
01:06:56,858 --> 01:06:58,917
..but Agent Sai Srinivas
Atreya is a real detective.

1213
01:06:58,997 --> 01:07:01,304
They fooled me. Very good.

1214
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:02,200
They did a great job.

1215
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,475
The case has become interesting now.

1216
01:07:03,555 --> 01:07:06,002
I won't stop unless I find the culprits.

1217
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,637
What can we do?
- Do three things?

1218
01:07:08,897 --> 01:07:12,580
First. Find out where Ajay and
Harsha went and the people they met.

1219
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,535
Only then we'll find out
what they were really up to.

1220
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:16,058
Second. Gopalam gave me three numbers.

1221
01:07:16,138 --> 01:07:17,138
Ajay, Harsha, Vasudha.

1222
01:07:17,218 --> 01:07:18,186
Two people are dead.

1223
01:07:18,266 --> 01:07:20,648
Vasudha is either dead
or soon going to die.

1224
01:07:20,728 --> 01:07:21,793
We need to find her quickly.

1225
01:07:21,873 --> 01:07:23,888
Third. Can you bail me out?

1226
01:07:24,277 --> 01:07:25,443
The case against you is very strong.

1227
01:07:25,523 --> 01:07:27,139
Apply for the bail.
- I'll try.

1228
01:07:27,219 --> 01:07:27,992
Okay.

1229
01:07:29,202 --> 01:07:30,260
I'll leave now.

1230
01:07:33,847 --> 01:07:37,616
Shirish, when did Ajay die?
- At 9 pm.

1231
01:07:40,295 --> 01:07:42,120
But, I was at sub-jail at 9 pm.

1232
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,420
Really?
- I went there to ask about Gopalam.

1233
01:07:45,154 --> 01:07:46,202
Then how can I kill Ajay?

1234
01:07:46,282 --> 01:07:46,980
Go to the jail.

1235
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:49,345
Get the CCTV footage
and apply bail stating that..

1236
01:07:49,425 --> 01:07:51,268
..I wasn't at the crime
scene at the time of murder.

1237
01:07:51,348 --> 01:07:52,132
Right.

1238
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:53,385
I'll do it.
- Okay.

1239
01:07:53,465 --> 01:07:54,335
See you.

1240
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:02,392
The camera footage
of the jail wasn't clear.

1241
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,024
You've got interim bail for five days.

1242
01:08:04,585 --> 01:08:06,897
You need to find evidence
to prove your innocence.

1243
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:08,647
You've only five days.

1244
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,077
You've to go to the police
station and sign daily.

1245
01:08:13,076 --> 01:08:13,843
Okay.

1246
01:08:14,653 --> 01:08:15,474
Thanks, buddy.

1247
01:08:16,014 --> 01:08:17,504
Why don't you join us?
- No, I've to leave.

1248
01:08:17,584 --> 01:08:18,962
I've to go to Kabuli NGO.

1249
01:08:19,318 --> 01:08:21,360
I've lot of pending work there.
- Okay.

1250
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:24,287
See you soon. I'll call you.
- Okay.

1251
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,091
Thanks, buddy. Bye.

1252
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:29,838
The Sherlock Holmes dialogue that..

1253
01:08:30,076 --> 01:08:30,875
..you said yesterday was awesome.

1254
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,051
It was comic but very effective.

1255
01:08:35,099 --> 01:08:37,399
What's your next plan?

1256
01:08:37,723 --> 01:08:38,868
Listen to my plan carefully.

1257
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,201
The MLA's son is getting
married at Nellore today.

1258
01:08:41,428 --> 01:08:42,497
We'll go there and..

1259
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:47,369
Agent..
- I plan to go and dance there.

1260
01:08:47,639 --> 01:08:49,691
What's the next plan?
I've been framed for two murders.

1261
01:08:49,771 --> 01:08:50,793
Shall we solve this case first?

1262
01:08:52,241 --> 01:08:53,439
They've left.

1263
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,846
Excuse me.
- Yes.

1264
01:09:04,001 --> 01:09:06,107
Did this man come here?
- Who are you?

1265
01:09:06,301 --> 01:09:07,965
I'm from the special
investigation department.

1266
01:09:08,045 --> 01:09:09,185
Why do you know the information?

1267
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:10,838
Sneha..
- Agent.

1268
01:09:11,107 --> 01:09:13,170
..we haven't found the
children's kidnapper yet.

1269
01:09:13,386 --> 01:09:14,002
No, agent.

1270
01:09:14,082 --> 01:09:15,611
I've found him.
- Who is he, agent?

1271
01:09:15,805 --> 01:09:17,274
Abdul, the owner of Imran Cars.

1272
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:19,532
A man with a French
beard is kidnapping kids.

1273
01:09:20,201 --> 01:09:21,562
He's our regular customer.

1274
01:09:21,642 --> 01:09:24,284
He booked a cab for
Venkatachalam three days back.

1275
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:26,953
He came back yesterday
as he left something in the car.

1276
01:09:27,147 --> 01:09:28,076
This is the truth, sir.

1277
01:09:28,605 --> 01:09:30,387
Did he come to take
his personal belongings?

1278
01:09:30,581 --> 01:09:32,234
Yes, sir. He took all his belongings.

1279
01:09:32,623 --> 01:09:35,971
He wanted the newspaper
articles of unidentified bodies..

1280
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:37,289
..that were found in the last few days.

1281
01:09:37,369 --> 01:09:39,428
Unidentified bodies?
- Yes, sir.

1282
01:09:39,643 --> 01:09:42,138
He found a dead body
under Venkatachalam bridge.

1283
01:09:42,218 --> 01:09:44,579
He was after me to get the
post-mortem report of that body.

1284
01:09:44,659 --> 01:09:46,210
This is a government hospital.

1285
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:48,273
Nobody has the time
to conduct post-mortem of..

1286
01:09:48,353 --> 01:09:49,429
..unidentified bodies.

1287
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,892
They write anything in the report.

1288
01:09:51,972 --> 01:09:54,484
Heart attack. Kidney failure.

1289
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:55,931
They write down anything they feel like.

1290
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,400
That's how they try to finish their work.

1291
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,448
That's not all.

1292
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:01,115
Look at this.
This is the signature of Satish.

1293
01:10:01,195 --> 01:10:03,783
But, there's no doctor
named Satish in this hospital.

1294
01:10:03,956 --> 01:10:05,522
They used to come for these reports.

1295
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:09,508
If these reports get exposed,
I'll be in trouble.

1296
01:10:10,027 --> 01:10:11,183
I won't share it with anybody.

1297
01:10:11,263 --> 01:10:13,613
I knew Harsha for a long time.

1298
01:10:14,391 --> 01:10:15,665
He was a student of criminology.

1299
01:10:15,745 --> 01:10:19,014
He and Ajay were working
on a case of unidentified bodies.

1300
01:10:19,187 --> 01:10:21,433
I found a dead body
near Venkatachalam bridge.

1301
01:10:21,513 --> 01:10:22,740
I called them for that.

1302
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,922
Harsha was in great rush that day.

1303
01:10:25,116 --> 01:10:27,082
He dropped his bike keys somewhere.

1304
01:10:27,162 --> 01:10:29,878
So we went back to find the keys.

1305
01:10:31,931 --> 01:10:33,529
Sneha be careful as
there's a constable there.

1306
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:35,020
I'll guide you on phone.

1307
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:40,129
Who are you?

1308
01:10:40,485 --> 01:10:42,137
I've come for investigation.

1309
01:10:42,217 --> 01:10:43,930
But, some policemen already came before,
- Yes.

1310
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,518
This is the second level of investigation.

1311
01:10:45,598 --> 01:10:47,322
Do you doubt anybody?

1312
01:10:47,402 --> 01:10:48,650
Who can I doubt?

1313
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:49,990
Please leave me alone.

1314
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:52,722
Did Mr. Ajay give you
any documents that night?

1315
01:10:53,413 --> 01:10:54,223
He didn't give me anything.

1316
01:10:54,303 --> 01:10:56,761
Please try to recall.
You may remember something.

1317
01:10:56,841 --> 01:10:58,284
Recall? What can I recall?

1318
01:10:58,364 --> 01:11:00,207
I told you that he didn't give
me anything. Please don't disturb me.

1319
01:11:00,287 --> 01:11:01,363
I don't intend to disturb you.

1320
01:11:01,568 --> 01:11:04,182
Sneha, do as I say.

1321
01:11:05,197 --> 01:11:09,097
Go near the door.
Stand there. Turn around.

1322
01:11:10,177 --> 01:11:11,927
Look at her and repeat what I say.

1323
01:11:14,217 --> 01:11:14,919
Madam..

1324
01:11:15,221 --> 01:11:15,923
Madam..

1325
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:17,954
..your husband has been ruthlessly killed.

1326
01:11:18,034 --> 01:11:19,563
..your husband has been ruthlessly killed.

1327
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:21,551
Only we can help..

1328
01:11:21,724 --> 01:11:23,128
We're doing our best.

1329
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:24,640
If you don't help us..

1330
01:11:24,866 --> 01:11:27,026
To find out why Ajay
was killed and by whom..

1331
01:11:27,106 --> 01:11:28,203
It'll remain a secret.

1332
01:11:28,283 --> 01:11:30,709
Ajay's death will be wasted.

1333
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:32,211
The decision is yours.

1334
01:11:38,735 --> 01:11:39,491
Just a minute.

1335
01:11:40,106 --> 01:11:40,830
Yes!

1336
01:11:43,282 --> 01:11:44,492
Did you get anything?

1337
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:48,607
These are the photos
of the unidentified bodies.

1338
01:11:48,687 --> 01:11:51,620
They went to Ongole on
the 18th to click these photos.

1339
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:54,948
Agent, there's somebody at home.

1340
01:11:57,335 --> 01:11:58,847
The constable is sleeping.

1341
01:12:06,959 --> 01:12:08,299
He has woken up.

1342
01:12:08,379 --> 01:12:09,638
Turn around. Don't look at him.

1343
01:12:12,187 --> 01:12:13,062
Tell me..

1344
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:14,812
Let's have a casual conversation.

1345
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:15,924
Anything casual.

1346
01:12:16,004 --> 01:12:17,955
Did you feed the cat?
- Yes.

1347
01:12:18,138 --> 01:12:20,072
Does the cat drink buttermilk?
- Yes.

1348
01:12:20,152 --> 01:12:22,297
What's the name of your cat?
- I call him agent.

1349
01:12:23,409 --> 01:12:24,943
Has he left?
- Yes.

1350
01:12:25,234 --> 01:12:26,476
Let's go.

1351
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:32,274
Agent.
- What happened?

1352
01:13:32,354 --> 01:13:34,705
Agent, this is the same
envelope that somebody gave..

1353
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:37,308
..to Harsha at the supermarket that day.

1354
01:13:44,123 --> 01:13:45,474
My name is written here.

1355
01:13:47,061 --> 01:13:48,390
This has my details.

1356
01:13:48,703 --> 01:13:49,729
Let's go.

1357
01:14:01,772 --> 01:14:03,662
Agent, I've left my cell phone there.

1358
01:14:03,889 --> 01:14:05,822
Sneha, the constable will come back.

1359
01:14:05,902 --> 01:14:07,205
I'll be back soon.
- Get it quickly.

1360
01:14:43,831 --> 01:14:44,879
Agent!

1361
01:14:49,383 --> 01:14:50,290
Agent!

1362
01:14:50,539 --> 01:14:51,543
Are you okay?

1363
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:52,904
Are you fine?

1364
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:55,345
Let's get out of here.

1365
01:15:02,409 --> 01:15:03,641
Why are you stressed?

1366
01:15:04,904 --> 01:15:06,352
Somebody tried to kill me.

1367
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:08,685
This proves that we're on the right track.

1368
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:12,379
Don't panic. I'll be fine.

1369
01:15:16,915 --> 01:15:17,887
They've come.

1370
01:15:27,144 --> 01:15:28,191
Hello, sir.

1371
01:15:28,818 --> 01:15:30,470
Sir, thanks for responding immediately.

1372
01:15:30,697 --> 01:15:32,058
It's okay, Atreya.

1373
01:15:32,263 --> 01:15:33,905
I overheard your conversation yesterday.

1374
01:15:34,872 --> 01:15:36,751
It isn't safe to discuss
such things at the police station.

1375
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,555
So, I told you to meet me outside.

1376
01:15:39,484 --> 01:15:41,579
Explain this matter
right from the beginning.

1377
01:15:45,014 --> 01:15:48,276
Sneha, can you identify the
man who gave the envelope to Harsha?

1378
01:15:48,356 --> 01:15:49,626
I'll identify him if I see him.

1379
01:15:49,706 --> 01:15:52,575
I was concentrating on Harsha
and so I don't remember his bike's number.

1380
01:15:53,309 --> 01:15:56,485
But, I remember that
the first number was 7.

1381
01:15:56,689 --> 01:16:00,264
There are thousands of vehicles
whose number starts with 7.

1382
01:16:00,901 --> 01:16:02,111
It's not going to be easy.

1383
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:06,626
Anyway, I'll get the list of the
all the bikes that start with number 7.

1384
01:16:06,706 --> 01:16:08,192
Thank you, sir.

1385
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:12,178
I'm getting late.
Come to the station and sign.

1386
01:16:13,766 --> 01:16:15,299
See you tomorrow.
- Agent.

1387
01:16:17,308 --> 01:16:20,127
Agent, the bike that I
saw that day is parked outside.

1388
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,503
It's not exactly the
same one but its similar.

1389
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:31,652
It was like this

1390
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:36,404
Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

1391
01:16:36,706 --> 01:16:38,121
This is a police bike, Sneha.

1392
01:16:38,337 --> 01:16:39,752
It was used by blue colts.

1393
01:16:39,832 --> 01:16:41,243
The constables use it now.

1394
01:16:41,323 --> 01:16:43,803
I remember it because
it had blue and red stripes.

1395
01:16:44,073 --> 01:16:45,175
Okay. Come with me.

1396
01:16:47,325 --> 01:16:48,232
Sagar.
- Sir.

1397
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:50,630
Take out the list of the police
vehicles whose number starts with 7.

1398
01:16:51,084 --> 01:16:52,002
Quick.

1399
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:58,418
Sir, here's the list.

1400
01:16:59,184 --> 01:17:00,718
Sneha, what'll be that man's age?

1401
01:17:01,172 --> 01:17:02,727
Between 35-40.

1402
01:17:03,235 --> 01:17:05,989
Make a list of the people
who come under the age of 35-40.

1403
01:17:10,871 --> 01:17:11,627
Photos.

1404
01:17:12,264 --> 01:17:12,966
Was he the one?

1405
01:17:13,733 --> 01:17:14,479
Next?

1406
01:17:16,195 --> 01:17:17,751
Was he the one?
Next?

1407
01:17:20,364 --> 01:17:22,654
He's the one.
He gave the envelope to Harsha.

1408
01:17:24,987 --> 01:17:26,694
I've seen this man somewhere.

1409
01:17:26,931 --> 01:17:29,350
Sneha, are you sure?
- Damn sure, sir.

1410
01:17:30,949 --> 01:17:32,278
Suresh.
- Sir.

1411
01:17:32,537 --> 01:17:34,665
Call Narayan to the
police station immediately.

1412
01:17:34,745 --> 01:17:35,777
Go.
- Okay, sir.

1413
01:17:46,114 --> 01:17:47,096
Narayan, why are you late?

1414
01:17:47,176 --> 01:17:48,598
I went to the adjoining village.

1415
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:51,460
Narayan, come.
- Yes, sir.

1416
01:17:52,691 --> 01:17:54,894
Did you meet Harsha two days ago?

1417
01:17:56,223 --> 01:17:57,228
Yes, sir.

1418
01:17:57,308 --> 01:18:00,996
Why did you meet him?
- Actually I..

1419
01:18:01,688 --> 01:18:03,167
Why did you meet him?
- Sir..

1420
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:05,371
Tell me.

1421
01:18:05,997 --> 01:18:09,432
Sir, Harsha spotted him
near the dead body found under..

1422
01:18:09,512 --> 01:18:10,977
..Venkatachalam bridge.

1423
01:18:11,204 --> 01:18:14,855
He was a prisoner in my police station,
so he wanted his detail.

1424
01:18:15,092 --> 01:18:16,561
And I gave him the detail. That's it.

1425
01:18:17,673 --> 01:18:20,287
Are you speaking the truth?
- I swear on my mother.

1426
01:18:20,989 --> 01:18:22,944
Okay, you can go.
- Sir.

1427
01:18:24,035 --> 01:18:25,633
I think he's speaking the truth, Atreya.

1428
01:18:27,264 --> 01:18:29,932
Ajay and Harsha must've
seen me near the dead body.

1429
01:18:30,601 --> 01:18:33,301
They knew that I was investigating
the case of unidentified bodies.

1430
01:18:33,691 --> 01:18:35,354
Why didn't they file a case against me?

1431
01:18:35,668 --> 01:18:37,342
Why did they want my details?

1432
01:18:37,537 --> 01:18:39,351
Maybe they wanted
to meet me for this case.

1433
01:18:39,431 --> 01:18:41,619
Maybe they knew something
about this case, sir.

1434
01:18:42,095 --> 01:18:44,601
Before they could share any detail,
they got killed.

1435
01:18:45,713 --> 01:18:47,128
So, they tried to kill me.

1436
01:18:47,344 --> 01:18:50,444
Sir, they could've framed
anybody for the murder.

1437
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:51,546
Why did they frame me?

1438
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:54,668
The connection between Ajay,
Harsha and me is the dead body.

1439
01:18:54,851 --> 01:18:57,022
The entire episode
started with the dead body.

1440
01:18:57,314 --> 01:18:58,081
Sir, I've a request.

1441
01:18:58,161 --> 01:19:01,527
Please get a postmortem of this body done.

1442
01:19:01,927 --> 01:19:04,627
If we find out the reason of death,
we'll also find the connection..

1443
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:06,107
..between Ajay and Harsha's death.

1444
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,909
Sure.
- Thank you, sir.

1445
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,141
No problem.

1446
01:19:11,357 --> 01:19:12,815
I'll meet you tomorrow, sir.
- Okay.

1447
01:19:13,052 --> 01:19:14,046
Thank you, sir.

1448
01:19:14,126 --> 01:19:16,725
They told me to file a
complaint in this police station.

1449
01:19:16,898 --> 01:19:18,593
But, the area doesn't
come under our jurisdiction.

1450
01:19:18,673 --> 01:19:20,408
Everybody is ignoring my problem.

1451
01:19:20,488 --> 01:19:21,737
Why are you complaining here?

1452
01:19:21,817 --> 01:19:23,325
I've been receiving threats
since the last three days that..

1453
01:19:23,405 --> 01:19:24,092
..they'll kill my daughter.

1454
01:19:24,172 --> 01:19:25,258
But, you're not ready
to listen to my problem.

1455
01:19:25,338 --> 01:19:26,587
This is a police station.
Behave properly.

1456
01:19:26,667 --> 01:19:27,418
This is not an excuse, sir.

1457
01:19:27,613 --> 01:19:28,834
Why don't you understand my problem?

1458
01:19:28,914 --> 01:19:30,357
Why don't you throw away your uniform?

1459
01:19:31,037 --> 01:19:32,279
My daughter is missing.

1460
01:19:32,359 --> 01:19:33,673
What's the problem?
- Happy?

1461
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:35,401
Who is he? What does he want?

1462
01:19:35,481 --> 01:19:38,706
If anything happens to my daughter,
I won't spare anyone.

1463
01:19:38,786 --> 01:19:40,780
Sir, he's saying that
his daughter is missing.

1464
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,750
I told him that his address
doesn't come under our jurisdiction.

1465
01:19:44,106 --> 01:19:45,553
My daughter is missing, sir.

1466
01:19:46,234 --> 01:19:47,746
If anything happens to her..

1467
01:19:49,042 --> 01:19:50,619
Please find her, sir.

1468
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:52,542
I don't know where she is right now.

1469
01:19:53,028 --> 01:19:55,631
Listen to me, sir. Please calm down.

1470
01:19:55,901 --> 01:19:57,327
Crying won't help.

1471
01:19:57,737 --> 01:19:59,520
Let me see what I can do for you.

1472
01:20:00,168 --> 01:20:01,205
Please come and sit here.

1473
01:20:05,794 --> 01:20:07,404
Give details of your daughter.

1474
01:20:08,019 --> 01:20:10,611
She's fair and 5'5" tall.

1475
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:14,759
When she went out of the
house she was in a red dress.

1476
01:20:14,839 --> 01:20:16,768
Any identification mark?

1477
01:20:16,848 --> 01:20:19,577
She has a tattoo of her
mom which she got inked..

1478
01:20:19,657 --> 01:20:21,543
..on her hand when she was a child.

1479
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:25,269
She went to the chemist's
shop at night two days ago.

1480
01:20:25,561 --> 01:20:27,624
She didn't return home.
I asked everybody.

1481
01:20:27,704 --> 01:20:29,276
But, nobody knows about her.

1482
01:20:29,536 --> 01:20:32,193
What's your daughter's name?
- Vasudha.

1483
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:36,265
Vasudha?
- Yes, sir.

1484
01:20:37,928 --> 01:20:41,265
Sir, when was the last
time you met your daughter?

1485
01:20:41,849 --> 01:20:45,500
I spoke to her for the last time
when she was going to the chemist's shop.

1486
01:20:46,105 --> 01:20:47,336
She has been missing since then.

1487
01:20:47,416 --> 01:20:48,416
Did you try calling her?

1488
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:50,004
Her phone is switched off.

1489
01:20:51,322 --> 01:20:52,942
Suresh.
- Sir.

1490
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:54,659
Any information about a female dead body?

1491
01:20:54,739 --> 01:20:55,826
Yes, sir.

1492
01:20:56,074 --> 01:20:58,471
I've found a body under
Kawali bridge an hour ago.

1493
01:20:59,854 --> 01:21:01,463
Some officers have gone there.
- Okay.

1494
01:21:04,379 --> 01:21:05,913
Listen to me.
- Sir.

1495
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:07,436
Come with me.

1496
01:21:43,803 --> 01:21:44,884
Good morning, sir.

1497
01:21:45,164 --> 01:21:46,461
What happened?

1498
01:21:46,893 --> 01:21:50,274
We've found a girl's dead body
but it hasn't been identified yet.

1499
01:21:50,944 --> 01:21:52,456
She has been ruthlessly killed.

1500
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:54,389
Her face is disfigured.

1501
01:21:54,746 --> 01:21:56,927
The body has started decomposing
and is smelling awful.

1502
01:21:58,429 --> 01:22:00,600
Which colour clothes is she wearing?
- Red.

1503
01:22:04,693 --> 01:22:05,600
Come with me.

1504
01:22:23,692 --> 01:22:24,762
Sir, take a look.

1505
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,979
What has happened, Vasu?

1506
01:22:40,757 --> 01:22:42,377
Vasudha.

1507
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:43,900
Please don't touch the body.

1508
01:22:44,148 --> 01:22:46,092
Sir, I was telling you repeatedly.
- Sir, we got this.

1509
01:22:46,805 --> 01:22:49,095
They killed my daughter.

1510
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:59,388
They killed my daughter.

1511
01:23:01,213 --> 01:23:03,557
They killed my daughter.

1512
01:23:03,892 --> 01:23:05,177
We found it next to the body.

1513
01:23:07,499 --> 01:23:09,184
Vasu..

1514
01:23:20,288 --> 01:23:21,098
What's up?

1515
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:23,690
What are you doing here?

1516
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:25,991
Who allowed you to come here

1517
01:23:30,808 --> 01:23:32,320
Why are you looking up in the sky?

1518
01:23:32,795 --> 01:23:34,070
Counting stars during day time?

1519
01:23:34,448 --> 01:23:35,830
Will you get stars for her?

1520
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:37,753
Hey detective, he is talking to you.

1521
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:39,092
Can't you hear me?

1522
01:23:39,751 --> 01:23:41,037
Why are you always
spotted near dead bodies?

1523
01:23:41,117 --> 01:23:42,160
What can I do about it?

1524
01:23:42,894 --> 01:23:44,882
You never do your job.
- Mind your language.

1525
01:23:44,962 --> 01:23:46,686
If you did your job properly
then the girl wouldn't have died.

1526
01:23:46,891 --> 01:23:48,134
Lower your voice.
- What will you do?

1527
01:23:48,868 --> 01:23:50,477
Do you know who killed her?
- Who?

1528
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:52,033
You killed her.
- Yes.

1529
01:23:52,113 --> 01:23:54,950
You've killed her in the same
way as you killed Ajay and Harsha.

1530
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,814
You've killed her.

1531
01:23:55,894 --> 01:23:57,261
You're not capable to solve this crime.

1532
01:23:57,341 --> 01:23:59,141
Call me and I'll solve the case for you.

1533
01:23:59,221 --> 01:24:00,901
What do you think of yourself?
- Agent, let's go from here.

1534
01:24:00,981 --> 01:24:02,856
What are you saying?
- You're speaking a lot.

1535
01:24:03,051 --> 01:24:04,725
Don't be sacred.
We haven't done anything wrong.

1536
01:24:04,805 --> 01:24:05,708
Agent, let's go.
- You don't worry.

1537
01:24:05,788 --> 01:24:06,766
Yes, tell me.

1538
01:24:06,846 --> 01:24:07,717
Listen.
- Yes.

1539
01:24:08,246 --> 01:24:09,369
The same detective has killed this girl.

1540
01:24:09,449 --> 01:24:10,579
Okay.
- Cancel his bail.

1541
01:24:10,659 --> 01:24:11,633
Okay? - Okay.
- Agent, let's go from here.

1542
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,599
Will you arrest anybody you
see at the crime scene? - Agent.

1543
01:24:13,858 --> 01:24:14,797
Let's go.
- How dare you challenge?

1544
01:24:14,877 --> 01:24:16,353
The dead body is also at the crime scene.
Will you arrest her?

1545
01:24:16,433 --> 01:24:17,962
Cancel the bail of the dead body.

1546
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:20,058
You can't do your work and
you consider yourself an inspector.

1547
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,073
Go from here.

1548
01:24:21,153 --> 01:24:22,693
Go and start a street-side food stall.

1549
01:24:23,114 --> 01:24:25,220
Did you bring him here?

1550
01:24:25,706 --> 01:24:28,007
Are you taking his help?
- Sorry, sir.

1551
01:24:29,789 --> 01:24:32,025
Take him away from there.

1552
01:24:32,381 --> 01:24:34,440
Okay, sir.
- Take him away.

1553
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,460
Clear the place.

1554
01:24:35,903 --> 01:24:38,862
Leave me. Vasu..

1555
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:42,599
Vasu..

1556
01:24:49,846 --> 01:24:51,628
I told you to come and meet me tomorrow.

1557
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:11,480
What's this, Atreya?

1558
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,195
You've applied for bail and there
are strong chances of it being cancelled.

1559
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:17,669
Why did you argue with them?

1560
01:25:21,277 --> 01:25:23,037
We couldn't save Vasudha, sir.
- So?

1561
01:25:26,537 --> 01:25:30,458
Sir, can you get the autopsy report
of the body found under railway bridge.

1562
01:25:35,599 --> 01:25:36,723
Hello, Aditya.

1563
01:25:36,928 --> 01:25:39,769
Hello, Vamsi.
I wanted to tell you about the dead body.

1564
01:25:40,309 --> 01:25:42,177
It's neither murder nor suicide.

1565
01:25:42,383 --> 01:25:44,500
It's a natural death. Liver failure.

1566
01:25:44,748 --> 01:25:45,806
Natural death?

1567
01:25:46,109 --> 01:25:48,280
How will we know whose body it is?

1568
01:25:48,485 --> 01:25:51,758
I've sent his fingerprints and hair
samples for matching with the database.

1569
01:25:52,104 --> 01:25:54,826
If we're lucky we'll find a match.
- No..no..

1570
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:57,116
Okay, Aditya. Thank you.

1571
01:25:57,196 --> 01:25:58,596
How can it be a natural death?

1572
01:25:58,676 --> 01:26:00,033
Three people were killed
because of this death.

1573
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:02,128
Ajay, Harsha and Vasudha.
All three of them were killed.

1574
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:04,461
There's a serious problem.
How can it be natural death?

1575
01:26:06,188 --> 01:26:08,154
Let's meet Aditya and check the report.

1576
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,549
Shall I help you.. kick the bike?

1577
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:34,130
Who are you?

1578
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:40,383
Why were you following us?

1579
01:26:45,557 --> 01:26:48,009
What's up?
Have you tied us or have we tied you?

1580
01:26:48,722 --> 01:26:51,109
You'll set me free and
salute me when you find out.

1581
01:26:52,157 --> 01:26:52,956
Is it?

1582
01:26:53,036 --> 01:26:55,311
If you see my track record
you'll see that I finish..

1583
01:26:55,391 --> 01:26:58,605
..dozens of criminals like you in a day.

1584
01:26:59,999 --> 01:27:01,911
This is the last time I'm asking you.
Who are you?

1585
01:27:11,308 --> 01:27:12,896
My name is Bal Venkata Subramanian Swami.

1586
01:27:13,069 --> 01:27:15,867
As it was a long name I call myself Bobby.

1587
01:27:16,158 --> 01:27:17,876
I'm from Hassan, Karnataka.

1588
01:27:18,092 --> 01:27:19,031
Come to the point.

1589
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:21,181
I was following you for the last two days.

1590
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:22,315
Why were you following me?

1591
01:27:22,395 --> 01:27:24,745
Why are you asking me?
I'm a detective.

1592
01:27:24,983 --> 01:27:26,430
What else will I do?

1593
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:28,115
I run FBI.

1594
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:31,582
FBI stands for?
- Friends Bureau of Investigation.

1595
01:27:31,766 --> 01:27:33,732
My friends helped me with it so..

1596
01:27:37,243 --> 01:27:38,399
Why are you laughing?

1597
01:27:39,036 --> 01:27:41,477
Check on social media and
you'll find a page on FBI Hassan.

1598
01:27:41,557 --> 01:27:43,464
Sherlock Holmes has liked it.

1599
01:27:43,885 --> 01:27:46,402
I thought there was only
one spirit of Sherlock Holmes.

1600
01:27:49,577 --> 01:27:50,441
What else?

1601
01:27:50,744 --> 01:27:53,865
One day when I was going home,
I saw a dead body on the road.

1602
01:27:54,751 --> 01:27:56,717
Nobody came to claim that body.

1603
01:27:56,797 --> 01:27:59,439
The police declared it
unidentified and cremated the body.

1604
01:27:59,634 --> 01:28:02,658
I got to know that you killed that person.

1605
01:28:03,263 --> 01:28:06,266
Since then I've investigating
the case and was following you.

1606
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:07,897
Did you get a call?
- Yes.

1607
01:28:08,112 --> 01:28:09,333
They took my name.
- Of course.

1608
01:28:09,527 --> 01:28:11,374
And you started following me.
- Right.

1609
01:28:11,454 --> 01:28:14,809
Shut up! Shut up,
Bal Venkata Subramanian Swami.

1610
01:28:15,122 --> 01:28:16,958
They've fooled us.

1611
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:19,032
They managed to dupe you more.

1612
01:28:19,238 --> 01:28:20,145
Didn't you get it, sir?

1613
01:28:20,225 --> 01:28:23,256
They confused me and made
me follow Ajay and Harsha.

1614
01:28:23,336 --> 01:28:26,042
They followed the same tactic
and made this fellow follow me.

1615
01:28:26,122 --> 01:28:28,278
They killed them and
framed me for the murders.

1616
01:28:28,358 --> 01:28:32,890
Now that I've got bail they
want to kill me and frame him for it.

1617
01:28:33,355 --> 01:28:34,683
It's a dangerous game, sir.

1618
01:28:35,125 --> 01:28:37,588
We're busy solving the case like fools.

1619
01:28:38,073 --> 01:28:40,558
Do you do drugs?
- No, only alcohol and smoke.

1620
01:28:40,638 --> 01:28:42,923
Start doing drugs as they'll
soon find drugs from your house.

1621
01:28:43,215 --> 01:28:46,423
They've managed to cover their
perfect crime and we're their scapegoats.

1622
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:51,326
We're chasing each other
like fools and playing silly games.

1623
01:28:51,406 --> 01:28:54,156
You played well.
Very well-played. God bless you.

1624
01:28:54,771 --> 01:28:56,240
Was it a game?

1625
01:28:56,554 --> 01:28:57,731
Didn't you kill anybody?

1626
01:28:57,811 --> 01:28:58,768
You're a useless detective.

1627
01:28:58,848 --> 01:29:00,528
Shall I give it to you in writing?
Set him free.

1628
01:29:00,608 --> 01:29:01,306
Please.

1629
01:29:05,864 --> 01:29:10,919
If this is a game then who told me
about the dead body on the railway track.

1630
01:29:11,384 --> 01:29:12,518
I'm confused

1631
01:29:13,004 --> 01:29:14,689
What did you say?
- That I'm a detective.

1632
01:29:14,883 --> 01:29:15,715
No, after that.

1633
01:29:15,795 --> 01:29:16,374
I was going home.

1634
01:29:16,454 --> 01:29:17,195
No..no.. what did you say in the end?

1635
01:29:17,275 --> 01:29:18,707
A dead body was found
on the railway track.

1636
01:29:22,336 --> 01:29:25,252
Venkatachalam. Venkatachalam.

1637
01:29:28,417 --> 01:29:30,793
The body at Venkatachalam
was found near the railway track.

1638
01:29:31,787 --> 01:29:33,882
The body at Kawali was also
found under a railway bridge.

1639
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,939
This body was also found
near the railway track.

1640
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:38,743
So what?

1641
01:29:39,964 --> 01:29:40,903
It means..

1642
01:29:47,308 --> 01:29:48,712
Shirish..
- Yes, tell me.

1643
01:29:48,993 --> 01:29:50,840
Do you've the list of the places
where the unidentified dead bodies..

1644
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,313
..were found in the past one year?

1645
01:29:53,497 --> 01:29:55,236
I've the list but I'm busy right now.

1646
01:29:55,316 --> 01:29:57,126
Can you send me the list right now?

1647
01:29:57,483 --> 01:29:58,498
I'm not in office right now.

1648
01:29:58,811 --> 01:30:00,356
Mail to me.

1649
01:30:00,436 --> 01:30:02,192
Okay, I'll tell my colleague
to mail it to you. Okay?

1650
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:04,006
Okay. Do it quickly.
- Okay, bye.

1651
01:30:07,711 --> 01:30:10,552
Atreya, he has applied
for your bail cancellation.

1652
01:30:10,854 --> 01:30:12,259
The hearing is scheduled
at 11 in the morning tomorrow.

1653
01:30:13,652 --> 01:30:15,640
You may have to surrender
by tomorrow afternoon.

1654
01:30:17,379 --> 01:30:20,630
Agent. Shirish has sent the
list of the unidentified bodies.

1655
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:41,855
52 unidentified dead bodies
have been found in our state..

1656
01:30:41,935 --> 01:30:43,345
..in the last six months.

1657
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:48,465
24 bodies have been found near the
railway track or under the railway bridge.

1658
01:30:49,016 --> 01:30:50,992
Kakinada and Tada.

1659
01:30:51,641 --> 01:30:53,984
All the bodies have been
found between these two stations.

1660
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:55,723
Some were found in Ongole,
some at Nellore.

1661
01:30:56,037 --> 01:30:57,690
All of them were found
near the railway tracks.

1662
01:30:57,992 --> 01:31:00,066
These cases are not separate.

1663
01:31:00,843 --> 01:31:01,901
All these cases are connected.

1664
01:31:02,236 --> 01:31:03,662
What?
- Yes.

1665
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:04,753
How?

1666
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:09,235
These bodies are being thrown
out of a train that runs on this route.

1667
01:31:09,603 --> 01:31:10,348
From a train.

1668
01:31:10,607 --> 01:31:12,465
Sir, we found a body near Venkatachalam.

1669
01:31:12,832 --> 01:31:14,604
What was the cause of death?
- Natural death.

1670
01:31:14,684 --> 01:31:15,824
Right?
- Hmm..

1671
01:31:15,904 --> 01:31:17,607
Then how did the body
reach the railway track.

1672
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:19,745
One more point.

1673
01:31:19,825 --> 01:31:21,679
The places where these bodies were found..

1674
01:31:21,759 --> 01:31:23,331
..don't have a road
that leads to that spot.

1675
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:27,187
How did the dead bodies reach
the place where there's no road?

1676
01:31:27,641 --> 01:31:31,357
It's definite that the bodies
are being thrown out of a train.

1677
01:31:31,583 --> 01:31:33,290
But, if dead bodies are transferred
by train they'll get caught.

1678
01:31:33,819 --> 01:31:36,541
What if it is a goods' train?

1679
01:31:37,081 --> 01:31:39,566
Agent, why can't it be a passenger train?

1680
01:31:40,343 --> 01:31:41,305
Think about it.

1681
01:31:42,179 --> 01:31:44,491
A passenger train
carries lot of travelers.

1682
01:31:44,826 --> 01:31:45,873
It's impossible there.

1683
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:49,567
Sir, let me sit on the side
berth so that I can throw the dead body.

1684
01:31:49,869 --> 01:31:50,572
That's impossible.

1685
01:31:50,788 --> 01:31:51,792
I'm sure it's a goods' train.

1686
01:31:52,570 --> 01:31:54,708
This can't be done in broad
daylight even from a goods' train.

1687
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:55,809
I'm sure it is done at night.

1688
01:31:56,295 --> 01:31:57,462
It's impossible during the day.

1689
01:31:57,542 --> 01:31:59,654
At night they do it at a
time when everybody is sleeping.

1690
01:31:59,734 --> 01:32:02,592
It means after 10 in
the night and before 5 am.

1691
01:32:02,672 --> 01:32:03,554
Bobby.
- Agent.

1692
01:32:03,634 --> 01:32:05,164
Find out the goods'
train that pass through..

1693
01:32:05,402 --> 01:32:07,864
..the Kakinada-Tada route after 10 pm.

1694
01:32:07,944 --> 01:32:08,469
Okay.

1695
01:32:08,685 --> 01:32:09,776
Sneha..
- Yes, agent.

1696
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,824
Open the map.

1697
01:32:12,281 --> 01:32:13,124
Look at this.

1698
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:15,532
This is Kakinada and this is Tada.

1699
01:32:16,289 --> 01:32:17,563
In the last six months..

1700
01:32:24,832 --> 01:32:26,776
I think these bodies are
being smuggled from Tamil Nadu.

1701
01:32:26,856 --> 01:32:28,548
How can you be sure that
they are coming from Tamil Nadu?

1702
01:32:28,628 --> 01:32:30,222
Look at this. This is Tada.

1703
01:32:30,794 --> 01:32:32,781
This comes in Tamil Nadu-Andhra border.

1704
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:38,031
This train either goes through
Tami Nadu and enters Andhra through Tada.

1705
01:32:38,111 --> 01:32:40,451
As soon as they cross Tamil
Nadu border they throw the bodies..

1706
01:32:40,531 --> 01:32:42,223
..wherever they want in Andhra.

1707
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:44,750
The police stations change
with the change in state.

1708
01:32:45,345 --> 01:32:48,434
The police fails to establish
a connection between these dead bodies.

1709
01:32:48,514 --> 01:32:50,086
The bodies are coming from another state.

1710
01:32:50,378 --> 01:32:52,246
So, they will not
be able to identify them.

1711
01:32:52,657 --> 01:32:54,936
Find out if you've any report
of unidentified bodies being..

1712
01:32:55,152 --> 01:32:57,885
..found in places beyond
Tada that come in Tamil Nadu.

1713
01:32:58,133 --> 01:32:58,965
Sure.

1714
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:01,147
Sneha.
- Agent.

1715
01:33:01,227 --> 01:33:02,659
Which are the stations after Tada?

1716
01:33:02,853 --> 01:33:05,423
After Tada comes Arambakkam
and Gummidipoondi.

1717
01:33:05,855 --> 01:33:08,091
After that comes the areas near Chennai.

1718
01:33:14,237 --> 01:33:15,566
Agent.
- What happened?

1719
01:33:15,646 --> 01:33:18,806
A goods' train goes to Delhi from
Chennai every week. - Yes!

1720
01:33:18,886 --> 01:33:22,284
The train stops at a signal
near Arambakkam around 10-10:30 pm..

1721
01:33:22,364 --> 01:33:26,616
..to allow a superfast train go.
- Yes!

1722
01:33:26,696 --> 01:33:27,933
Atreya.
- Yes, tell me.

1723
01:33:28,013 --> 01:33:31,865
No unidentified bodies were
found between Tada and Chennai.

1724
01:33:32,135 --> 01:33:32,794
Yes!

1725
01:33:32,966 --> 01:33:36,131
This train stops at Arambakkam
station for 30 minutes.

1726
01:33:36,211 --> 01:33:37,070
The culprits know this fact.

1727
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:39,090
They put the bodies inside
the train during this time.

1728
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:41,790
They throw the bodies randomly anywhere
after they cross the state borders.

1729
01:33:43,454 --> 01:33:45,884
Agent, how can you be sure that
this happens at this particular station?

1730
01:33:46,230 --> 01:33:49,157
The stations that come before
Arambakkam comes under Chennai.

1731
01:33:49,504 --> 01:33:52,280
It's not possible to do
this job at any big station.

1732
01:33:52,701 --> 01:33:55,012
They need a small station for this job.

1733
01:33:55,092 --> 01:33:56,578
And that station is Arambakkam.

1734
01:33:57,940 --> 01:34:01,428
They're doing so much hard
work only to dispose dead bodies.

1735
01:34:02,022 --> 01:34:06,148
We need to go to Arambakkam
to find the truth.

1736
01:34:13,645 --> 01:34:14,520
Vamsi sir will also join us.

1737
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,118
He'll come behind the market in his car.

1738
01:34:19,185 --> 01:34:20,795
Agent.. agent..

1739
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:24,575
Agent..
- Agent..

1740
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,498
Agent..
- Agent..

1741
01:34:28,097 --> 01:34:30,182
Sister, call the senior doctor.
- Okay.

1742
01:34:33,195 --> 01:34:33,908
Hi!

1743
01:34:36,176 --> 01:34:37,267
It's fake, doctor.

1744
01:34:37,347 --> 01:34:38,931
It makes sound and smoke emits out of it.

1745
01:34:39,448 --> 01:34:40,442
Then why was he bleeding?

1746
01:34:40,522 --> 01:34:42,375
He had coffee in one hand
and vermilion in another hand.

1747
01:34:42,548 --> 01:34:45,886
I added water and rubbed
it and blood was ready.

1748
01:34:45,966 --> 01:34:47,474
They've their eyes on me.

1749
01:34:47,949 --> 01:34:51,049
If they find out that we're going to
Arambakkam then they'll attack us again.

1750
01:34:51,265 --> 01:34:54,009
If we want to reach
Arambakkam secretly then..

1751
01:34:54,452 --> 01:34:58,707
..Agent Sai Srinivas Atreya has
to be critical injured and hospitalized.

1752
01:35:00,414 --> 01:35:02,250
You shot me very well.

1753
01:35:04,054 --> 01:35:05,274
Go and lie down.

1754
01:35:08,774 --> 01:35:09,692
Do you know what you're going to do?

1755
01:35:11,215 --> 01:35:12,100
Perfect! Do it again.

1756
01:35:12,846 --> 01:35:14,509
Good. Great!

1757
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:15,827
Cover him with a blanket.

1758
01:35:17,393 --> 01:35:18,613
They can come here too.

1759
01:35:18,808 --> 01:35:19,985
Will you help me, madam?

1760
01:35:20,065 --> 01:35:21,735
Go to the corridor after
five minutes and say..

1761
01:35:21,908 --> 01:35:24,349
Doc.. doc.. the patient is critical.

1762
01:35:24,429 --> 01:35:26,142
Atreya's BP is fluctuating.

1763
01:35:26,222 --> 01:35:27,934
Say something like this and come. Okay?

1764
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:29,144
Give an audition.

1765
01:35:29,414 --> 01:35:31,035
Doctor, the patient is critical.

1766
01:35:31,542 --> 01:35:33,368
Doctor, his BP is falling.

1767
01:35:33,448 --> 01:35:35,161
Please come doctor.

1768
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:37,807
Great!

1769
01:35:39,913 --> 01:35:41,328
Great!
- Let's go.

1770
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:42,246
That's mine.

1771
01:35:43,034 --> 01:35:44,838
Go and change your clothes.
- Okay.

1772
01:35:45,864 --> 01:35:48,294
Somebody has shot Atreya. He's in ICU now.

1773
01:35:48,374 --> 01:35:49,483
Okay. Keep an eye on him.

1774
01:35:54,138 --> 01:35:56,222
What's wrong with you, Bobby?
Why have you put this band aid?

1775
01:35:56,302 --> 01:35:57,453
This is just a bandage.

1776
01:35:57,533 --> 01:35:59,733
Do you even know what we do with people?

1777
01:35:59,813 --> 01:36:02,045
This is not band aid but my shroud.

1778
01:36:02,125 --> 01:36:03,956
I was born in a grave.

1779
01:36:05,371 --> 01:36:07,391
Sorry, it's too melodramatic.

1780
01:36:07,855 --> 01:36:10,977
I would've understood the dialogue
if you said it in any other language.

1781
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:11,992
Really?

1782
01:36:12,338 --> 01:36:14,498
It's a clichéd dialogue in films

1783
01:36:16,939 --> 01:36:18,927
Hey! Same pinch.

1784
01:36:26,638 --> 01:36:30,462
My mom says that every
person has seven lookalikes.

1785
01:36:30,542 --> 01:36:31,769
Two are right in front of me.

1786
01:36:38,174 --> 01:36:39,275
Sir, let's go.

1787
01:36:41,631 --> 01:36:42,581
Yes tell me, Aditya.

1788
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,817
The fingerprints of the
dead body found in Venkatachalam..

1789
01:36:45,055 --> 01:36:47,107
..matches that of a
murder suspect in Gujarat.

1790
01:36:47,187 --> 01:36:48,241
What?
- What?

1791
01:36:48,943 --> 01:36:50,974
I can provide the other details
only after a couple of hours.

1792
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:52,357
Okay.

1793
01:36:52,437 --> 01:36:53,923
A murder case in Gujarat?

1794
01:36:57,369 --> 01:36:58,633
What's going on, sir?

1795
01:37:08,829 --> 01:37:10,924
Hello, sir.
I'm a sub-inspector from Nellore.

1796
01:37:11,313 --> 01:37:13,333
I want some information.
- Okay.

1797
01:37:13,582 --> 01:37:16,433
A goods' train passes this
station at 10 in the night. - Yes.

1798
01:37:16,513 --> 01:37:17,805
It goes to Delhi.
- So?

1799
01:37:17,885 --> 01:37:20,905
When the train halts here
dos any illegal activity.. I mean..

1800
01:37:20,985 --> 01:37:22,147
Who will come here, sir?

1801
01:37:22,644 --> 01:37:24,998
I've been the station in-charge for years.

1802
01:37:25,387 --> 01:37:27,331
The goods' train stopped
here for half an hour.

1803
01:37:27,411 --> 01:37:29,643
I never noticed any illegal activities.

1804
01:37:29,934 --> 01:37:30,820
Gopalam?

1805
01:37:34,179 --> 01:37:35,432
Sir, whose photos are these?

1806
01:37:36,166 --> 01:37:38,629
Sir, these photos were clicked at
a function of the railways five years ago.

1807
01:37:40,217 --> 01:37:42,636
There's a popular theatre
group in the next village.

1808
01:37:42,716 --> 01:37:43,879
They're artists of that group.

1809
01:37:43,959 --> 01:37:45,618
Theatre group?
- Yes, sir.

1810
01:37:45,698 --> 01:37:47,324
Where's this theatre group located?

1811
01:37:47,648 --> 01:37:49,354
It's been closed for a long time.

1812
01:37:49,434 --> 01:37:52,130
Where will I find him?
- I don't know, sir.

1813
01:37:52,454 --> 01:37:54,366
Sir, do you know?
- I know.

1814
01:37:54,593 --> 01:37:56,170
He lives 30 km from here.

1815
01:37:59,053 --> 01:38:01,408
Atreya is not in the hospital.
Kill Gopalam.

1816
01:38:01,602 --> 01:38:02,682
Okay, I'll do it.

1817
01:38:10,005 --> 01:38:12,727
Who drinks to tolerate everything?

1818
01:38:13,062 --> 01:38:15,049
I ordered whisky.
Why did you get beer for me?

1819
01:38:15,129 --> 01:38:15,924
This is wrong.

1820
01:38:16,004 --> 01:38:18,138
I'll tell everybody. Listen to me.

1821
01:38:18,218 --> 01:38:20,439
Police! Police!

1822
01:38:20,913 --> 01:38:22,134
Police!

1823
01:38:25,504 --> 01:38:26,336
Who are you?

1824
01:38:26,552 --> 01:38:27,718
You were calling the police.

1825
01:38:33,702 --> 01:38:34,750
Where am I, sir?

1826
01:38:37,731 --> 01:38:38,822
Who are you?

1827
01:38:38,902 --> 01:38:40,928
Give me a small drink
and I'll say everything.

1828
01:38:42,613 --> 01:38:44,827
Do you want a drink now?

1829
01:38:48,856 --> 01:38:51,578
I didn't have any work three years back.

1830
01:38:52,366 --> 01:38:55,066
We would keep wandering
from one village to another.

1831
01:38:55,422 --> 01:38:57,032
I got a phone call one day.

1832
01:38:57,853 --> 01:39:01,007
I was asked to do a task
and he promised to give me money.

1833
01:39:01,309 --> 01:39:03,382
Hello. Where do I have to go?

1834
01:39:05,024 --> 01:39:07,778
I'll be there. I'm coming.

1835
01:39:07,962 --> 01:39:09,960
I've got work. Let's go.

1836
01:39:10,187 --> 01:39:11,494
C'mon, let's go.

1837
01:39:45,788 --> 01:39:49,406
We were told to take the dead
bodies to the state border and..

1838
01:39:49,486 --> 01:39:51,663
..and cremate them quietly in the jungle.

1839
01:40:18,083 --> 01:40:20,254
In the beginning we got
3-4 dead bodies in a month.

1840
01:40:20,334 --> 01:40:22,036
Then we started getting 7-8 dead bodies.

1841
01:40:22,792 --> 01:40:25,730
We would get 5000 rupees per dead body.

1842
01:40:26,885 --> 01:40:28,063
We were very happy.

1843
01:40:51,835 --> 01:40:56,965
But, one day the forest
police caught us cremating a body.

1844
01:40:57,045 --> 01:40:59,384
We heard the siren and managed to escape.

1845
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:02,387
The people who gave us the
contract came to know about it.

1846
01:41:02,467 --> 01:41:03,435
Do something.

1847
01:41:03,629 --> 01:41:05,098
Stop this work for few days.

1848
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:08,782
Okay. Don't worry. I'll do as you say.

1849
01:41:09,451 --> 01:41:12,778
We would steal for livelihood.

1850
01:41:13,350 --> 01:41:15,348
But, this job helped us earn decent money.

1851
01:41:15,428 --> 01:41:17,163
But, we stopped getting money.

1852
01:41:17,243 --> 01:41:18,589
We were worried.

1853
01:41:19,129 --> 01:41:23,179
Two weeks after this
incident I got a call.

1854
01:41:27,759 --> 01:41:31,540
This time instead of cremating the
bodies we would take them to another van.

1855
01:41:37,728 --> 01:41:41,497
They would return the bodies
after keeping them for 7-8 hours.

1856
01:41:47,341 --> 01:41:49,739
Bring the dead bodies to
the place mentioned by us and..

1857
01:41:49,819 --> 01:41:51,834
..dispose them at the same time.

1858
01:41:57,797 --> 01:42:00,313
The dead bodies were treated
in such a way that nobody..

1859
01:42:00,393 --> 01:42:02,333
..could identify them
even if they were found.

1860
01:42:02,851 --> 01:42:05,821
After doing that we would
take the bodies to Arambakkam.

1861
01:42:17,043 --> 01:42:20,499
The train to Delhi stopped
at Arambakkam station for 30 minutes.

1862
01:42:21,223 --> 01:42:23,059
We carried the dead
bodies and took them there.

1863
01:42:26,558 --> 01:42:28,438
We would put them in the train.

1864
01:42:28,643 --> 01:42:30,814
After crossing the border of
the state they were randomly disposed..

1865
01:42:30,894 --> 01:42:32,737
..in different places.

1866
01:43:12,529 --> 01:43:13,566
Who are these people?

1867
01:43:14,030 --> 01:43:15,164
Why do they do this?

1868
01:43:15,531 --> 01:43:16,848
From where do the dead bodies come from?

1869
01:43:16,928 --> 01:43:18,436
We didn't know anything.

1870
01:43:18,695 --> 01:43:20,510
We never had the courage to ask.

1871
01:43:21,785 --> 01:43:25,846
But one day we understood the game.

1872
01:43:26,203 --> 01:43:30,480
Cremate him and dispose
the ashes in the holy Ganges.

1873
01:43:35,352 --> 01:43:38,819
Followers of Hinduism believe
that if the ashes of the cremated bodies..

1874
01:43:38,899 --> 01:43:40,612
..are immersed in the
Ganges the soul rests in peace.

1875
01:43:41,704 --> 01:43:44,760
People believe that if
a dead person is cremated on..

1876
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:48,119
..the banks of Kashi the
soul goes straight to heaven..

1877
01:43:48,199 --> 01:43:49,523
..and is freed from the
cycle of birth and death.

1878
01:43:51,316 --> 01:43:53,995
Some people believe
these things from heart..

1879
01:43:54,075 --> 01:43:59,082
..but they don't have enough money
to take the body to Kashi for cremation.

1880
01:43:59,643 --> 01:44:03,586
The people who couldn't
go to Kashi were targeted by them.

1881
01:44:04,201 --> 01:44:05,875
We understood their game plan.

1882
01:44:06,534 --> 01:44:08,705
To win the confidence of the villagers..

1883
01:44:09,007 --> 01:44:12,463
..we pretended to offer prayers
before taking the dead body.

1884
01:44:12,755 --> 01:44:15,714
We would tie a talisman
of Goddess Durga on the bodies.

1885
01:44:16,773 --> 01:44:18,738
People's faith in us started growing.

1886
01:44:19,062 --> 01:44:22,076
We became popular in
the other villages and states.

1887
01:44:22,789 --> 01:44:24,269
The number of dead
bodies we got increased.

1888
01:44:24,830 --> 01:44:28,125
Cremation must take
place within a day or two..

1889
01:44:28,308 --> 01:44:31,397
..or the soul will always
keep wandering on the earth.

1890
01:44:32,024 --> 01:44:33,709
It'll never get peace.

1891
01:44:33,935 --> 01:44:37,295
The people were told that the
dead bodies would be taken to Kashi.

1892
01:44:37,705 --> 01:44:40,254
But, after taking money
from them the dead bodies were..

1893
01:44:40,334 --> 01:44:41,551
..thrown out of train compartments.

1894
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:41,215
Nobody found out about
our work in the last three years.

1895
01:45:42,156 --> 01:45:46,692
Last month I fell sick and
I was hospitalized for two weeks.

1896
01:45:46,962 --> 01:45:50,365
The dead bodies we had were
decomposing in the warehouse.

1897
01:45:50,927 --> 01:45:54,632
We got a call saying that
they couldn't wait anymore.

1898
01:45:55,388 --> 01:45:57,213
But, I couldn't go from the hospital.

1899
01:45:57,293 --> 01:45:59,017
I sent somebody else in my place.

1900
01:45:59,097 --> 01:46:01,220
The person I sent didn't come back.

1901
01:46:01,414 --> 01:46:05,551
I got another call and they
told me to stop the work for some days.

1902
01:46:05,631 --> 01:46:06,512
That's not all.

1903
01:46:06,592 --> 01:46:08,078
They sent me three phone numbers.

1904
01:46:08,575 --> 01:46:10,886
They gave me the photo
of a missing girl and told me..

1905
01:46:10,966 --> 01:46:13,154
..to cook up a story and tell you.

1906
01:46:13,234 --> 01:46:15,271
Believe me, this is the truth.

1907
01:46:17,701 --> 01:46:18,987
What's the name of
the person who called you?

1908
01:46:19,181 --> 01:46:20,240
I don't know.

1909
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,957
Why were the bodies
shifted to another van?

1910
01:46:22,037 --> 01:46:23,102
I don't know.

1911
01:46:23,772 --> 01:46:24,722
You don't know who
are the people involved.

1912
01:46:24,802 --> 01:46:27,499
I always got calls from landline numbers.

1913
01:46:27,855 --> 01:46:29,897
Who are the people involved?
What do they do?

1914
01:46:29,977 --> 01:46:31,225
How many people are involved?

1915
01:46:31,305 --> 01:46:32,500
I don't know anything.

1916
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:36,334
I also don't know what they
do with the dead bodies inside the van.

1917
01:46:36,414 --> 01:46:37,598
I'm speaking the truth.

1918
01:46:39,996 --> 01:46:41,000
Let's go.

1919
01:46:49,382 --> 01:46:50,397
You carry on, I'll join you.

1920
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:52,233
You'll see an old building.

1921
01:46:52,438 --> 01:46:53,346
That's the warehouse.

1922
01:46:53,426 --> 01:46:54,361
Okay, I got it.
- Come fast.

1923
01:46:54,729 --> 01:46:55,474
We are here.

1924
01:46:55,874 --> 01:46:59,763
Hey! Didn't your relatives
and neighbours ask you questions..

1925
01:47:00,325 --> 01:47:03,252
..when you took so many dead bodies?

1926
01:47:03,684 --> 01:47:06,676
If anybody asked questions we
would make up false stories and tell them.

1927
01:47:06,924 --> 01:47:10,532
For example it's important
to cremate the dead bodies or..

1928
01:47:10,996 --> 01:47:12,811
..the soul won't rest in peace.

1929
01:47:13,049 --> 01:47:15,123
It'll be ominous for
the family and village.

1930
01:47:15,383 --> 01:47:18,148
So, it was necessary
to cremate the bodies quickly.

1931
01:47:18,936 --> 01:47:22,112
We also made up a story that if
a body is cremated early in the morning..

1932
01:47:22,295 --> 01:47:24,078
..the soul goes straight to heaven.

1933
01:47:24,358 --> 01:47:28,333
It'll break the cycle of life and
death and the soul will attain salvation.

1934
01:47:28,657 --> 01:47:31,519
So, we couldn't wait for any relative.

1935
01:47:36,682 --> 01:47:37,772
But, this..

1936
01:47:46,014 --> 01:47:46,737
Uncle..

1937
01:47:46,817 --> 01:47:47,547
Yes, tell me Sheenu.

1938
01:47:47,818 --> 01:47:50,162
Why did you cremate
mom's body before I arrived?

1939
01:47:51,318 --> 01:47:53,197
I told you about the ominous time..

1940
01:47:53,277 --> 01:47:56,977
Uncle, speak the truth.

1941
01:47:58,284 --> 01:48:01,848
They were telling that we
should take your mother to Kashi.

1942
01:48:31,854 --> 01:48:35,191
When I was in school I
wrote a letter to mom saying..

1943
01:48:35,271 --> 01:48:37,373
..that I felt scared
to stay alone in the hostel.

1944
01:48:37,902 --> 01:48:39,889
She came to me in a couple
of days after getting the letter.

1945
01:49:01,924 --> 01:49:03,965
I've only one memory with my mom.

1946
01:49:05,315 --> 01:49:07,303
My father died when I was a child.

1947
01:49:07,961 --> 01:49:09,301
My mom was my family.

1948
01:49:14,334 --> 01:49:17,142
And one day even my mom left me alone.

1949
01:49:18,968 --> 01:49:20,858
She was not at home.

1950
01:49:22,165 --> 01:49:23,645
I was confused.

1951
01:49:27,252 --> 01:49:30,816
I couldn't even see my mom the last time.

1952
01:49:32,534 --> 01:49:35,126
I wasn't with her when she needed me.

1953
01:49:35,322 --> 01:49:37,482
This thought hurts me every day.

1954
01:49:38,389 --> 01:49:40,765
My mom did so much for me.

1955
01:49:41,079 --> 01:49:43,898
I couldn't even perform her last rites.
I'm so helpless.

1956
01:49:45,076 --> 01:49:46,933
What kind of son am I?

1957
01:49:47,117 --> 01:49:49,115
I thought she would never die.

1958
01:49:49,903 --> 01:49:51,362
And I couldn't see her the last time.

1959
01:49:52,636 --> 01:49:57,000
When somebody dies we
perform their last rites..

1960
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:00,413
..to show respect to their life.

1961
01:50:00,996 --> 01:50:03,362
I couldn't even do that for my mother.

1962
01:50:06,699 --> 01:50:10,134
She was thrown out of a train
compartment the way garbage is disposed.

1963
01:50:10,890 --> 01:50:12,164
My mom was thrown out.

1964
01:50:16,042 --> 01:50:17,176
It's not only me.

1965
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,418
There are many people like me.

1966
01:50:18,591 --> 01:50:20,438
Somebody mom,
somebody's dad, somebody's sister..

1967
01:50:20,518 --> 01:50:23,041
Many people couldn't see their
near and dear ones the last time..

1968
01:50:23,121 --> 01:50:24,305
..only because of these people.

1969
01:50:38,596 --> 01:50:40,724
Gopalam doesn't know who his boss is.

1970
01:50:41,264 --> 01:50:42,560
How will we find out?

1971
01:50:52,119 --> 01:50:53,005
Pass it to me.

1972
01:51:04,304 --> 01:51:06,129
Sir, I want to talk to your friend.

1973
01:51:13,312 --> 01:51:14,338
Hello.
- Hello, Aditya.

1974
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:15,656
Atreya wants to talk to you.

1975
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:17,751
Sir..
- Yes, tell me.

1976
01:51:18,669 --> 01:51:19,932
When did the murder in Gujarat take place?

1977
01:51:21,445 --> 01:51:22,406
Hold on.

1978
01:51:25,711 --> 01:51:26,500
Five days back.

1979
01:51:27,299 --> 01:51:29,470
When did the man whose body
was found in Venkatachalam die?

1980
01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:34,137
Ten days back.

1981
01:51:34,217 --> 01:51:35,141
Thank you, sir.

1982
01:51:37,107 --> 01:51:40,736
How can the man who died ten
days ago kill anybody five days back?

1983
01:51:44,419 --> 01:51:46,914
If you take out organs from
a body it'll be easily noticed.

1984
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:50,306
But you can steal something
from a body without getting caught.

1985
01:51:52,822 --> 01:51:53,881
Our fingerprints.

1986
01:51:54,929 --> 01:51:59,130
These people need the fingerprints
and not the dead bodies.

1987
01:52:01,982 --> 01:52:03,591
What will they do with these fingerprints?

1988
01:52:04,649 --> 01:52:07,458
These fingerprints can
be planted in any crime scene.

1989
01:52:07,538 --> 01:52:09,401
They can turn the investigation
in another direction.

1990
01:52:09,481 --> 01:52:12,966
They can make a database of fake
fingerprints and sell it to the criminals.

1991
01:52:13,711 --> 01:52:15,774
The same has happened
in the Venkatachalam case.

1992
01:52:15,854 --> 01:52:17,599
The fingerprint of this
dead body has been planted..

1993
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:18,885
..in a crime that happened in Gujarat.

1994
01:52:18,965 --> 01:52:20,213
They investigate the case
assuming that the person..

1995
01:52:20,293 --> 01:52:22,039
..whose finger print has
been found is the criminal.

1996
01:52:22,265 --> 01:52:25,171
But, they never find out whose
finger prints they actually are.

1997
01:52:25,251 --> 01:52:28,919
Even if they trace the
person he'll be found dead.

1998
01:52:29,145 --> 01:52:33,530
It means, the case will be
shut assuming the criminal to be dead.

1999
01:52:34,632 --> 01:52:38,175
It's a dangerous plan to
mislead a crime investigation.

2000
01:52:38,255 --> 01:52:39,957
This is not all that happens in this plan.

2001
01:52:40,238 --> 01:52:42,636
New voters can be registered
on the basis of the fake finger prints..

2002
01:52:42,716 --> 01:52:44,407
..and elections can be rigged.

2003
01:52:44,487 --> 01:52:48,576
The fake finger prints help
the terrorists to get fake passports.

2004
01:52:48,656 --> 01:52:50,899
They can easily enter
any country and attack.

2005
01:52:50,979 --> 01:52:53,318
They only need finger prints.

2006
01:52:53,783 --> 01:52:57,099
If they need finger prints then
they can take it from any dead body.

2007
01:52:57,293 --> 01:52:59,885
It's not easy to get the
finger print of a dead body, Bobby.

2008
01:53:00,101 --> 01:53:03,266
After we die the blood and
oxygen supply in our body stops.

2009
01:53:03,346 --> 01:53:04,357
It's difficult to get the
fingerprints when this stops.

2010
01:53:04,595 --> 01:53:07,922
As Gopalam said they took
their finger prints in the van.

2011
01:53:08,570 --> 01:53:10,870
I'm sure there's a
lab set-up inside the van.

2012
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:13,192
They take the finger prints
with the help of chemicals.

2013
01:53:13,398 --> 01:53:15,417
This work takes 6-7 hours.

2014
01:53:15,497 --> 01:53:17,059
This entire racket is
being conducted for this.

2015
01:53:18,172 --> 01:53:21,758
After taking their finger prints
the bodies are stored in warehouses.

2016
01:53:21,838 --> 01:53:23,659
After that they are carried to
the trains from where they're disposed.

2017
01:53:23,739 --> 01:53:24,458
Do you know why?

2018
01:53:24,772 --> 01:53:26,316
That's because it's a rule
in the railway department that..

2019
01:53:26,396 --> 01:53:29,330
..an unidentified body should
be cremated within 3-4 days.

2020
01:53:29,410 --> 01:53:31,058
They're aware of this loophole.

2021
01:53:31,138 --> 01:53:33,067
And this is how they're
conducting this racket.

2022
01:53:35,822 --> 01:53:38,566
Gopalam said that they
were going to stop this business.

2023
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:43,626
If anybody wants to shut
this systematic business then..

2024
01:53:43,706 --> 01:53:45,916
..it's evident that they were
aware that they would be exposed.

2025
01:53:47,536 --> 01:53:50,042
And a person who's
afraid commits a mistake.

2026
01:53:50,517 --> 01:53:52,116
Sneha..
- Agent.

2027
01:53:52,196 --> 01:53:55,312
Where's the photos clicked by
Ajay and the file of unidentified bodies?

2028
01:53:55,766 --> 01:53:56,749
In the office.

2029
01:53:57,667 --> 01:54:00,983
Sir.. sir, Bobby and I'll
go to office to study the photos.

2030
01:54:01,063 --> 01:54:02,658
Okay.
- I've request.

2031
01:54:02,863 --> 01:54:04,721
Will you speak with Narayan
and get the objects that were..

2032
01:54:04,801 --> 01:54:05,855
..found with the dead
body at Venkatachalam?

2033
01:54:05,935 --> 01:54:07,908
Sure.
- We're missing some clues.

2034
01:54:08,362 --> 01:54:09,863
We need to study the case again.

2035
01:54:10,306 --> 01:54:11,203
One more thing.

2036
01:54:11,603 --> 01:54:13,471
Can you go to Ajay and Harsha's college?

2037
01:54:13,644 --> 01:54:14,530
College?
- Yes.

2038
01:54:14,610 --> 01:54:15,318
But why?

2039
01:54:15,398 --> 01:54:17,554
Any information about
them will be important for us.

2040
01:54:17,634 --> 01:54:18,256
Okay.

2041
01:54:22,868 --> 01:54:24,661
Sir, these were the objects
found with the dead body..

2042
01:54:24,741 --> 01:54:26,044
..near the Venkatachalam bridge.

2043
01:54:26,325 --> 01:54:28,161
Sir, any problem?
- No problem.

2044
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:47,635
Give the envelope of the constable.

2045
01:54:52,582 --> 01:54:53,629
We want to meet the principal.

2046
01:54:53,834 --> 01:54:55,681
The last room in the ground floor.
- Okay.

2047
01:54:55,761 --> 01:54:57,290
Haven't you made it yet?
- Almost done.

2048
01:54:57,370 --> 01:54:59,580
How long will you take?
- Just a couple of minutes.

2049
01:55:01,848 --> 01:55:04,494
Sir, Atreya's bail has been
cancelled and an arrest warrant..

2050
01:55:04,574 --> 01:55:05,369
..has been issued.

2051
01:55:07,418 --> 01:55:08,239
Narayan..
- Sir.

2052
01:55:08,319 --> 01:55:09,946
..start the car.
- Okay, sir.

2053
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:31,980
Ajay took these photos
of dead bodies in Ongole.

2054
01:55:32,402 --> 01:55:33,914
This was on the body of Venkatachalam.

2055
01:55:34,119 --> 01:55:35,512
How come both the bodies
have the same talisman?

2056
01:55:39,346 --> 01:55:40,847
This is the talisman of a Devi.

2057
01:55:41,378 --> 01:55:43,354
The people of the Vellore
district in Tamil Nadu..

2058
01:55:43,646 --> 01:55:44,704
..are her devotees.

2059
01:55:44,784 --> 01:55:46,054
The talisman of a Devi?

2060
01:55:48,582 --> 01:55:50,137
Do you remember what Gopalam said?

2061
01:55:50,667 --> 01:55:52,935
They would perform fake prayers
and tie fake talisman on the bodies.

2062
01:55:53,303 --> 01:55:55,128
They would take out the talisman
before throwing out the bodies.

2063
01:55:55,344 --> 01:55:56,964
Gopalam didn't go to work that day.

2064
01:55:57,288 --> 01:56:00,572
The person who replaced Gopalam
may not be aware about the talisman.

2065
01:56:00,652 --> 01:56:02,612
That's the reason why these
two bodies still have talisman on them.

2066
01:56:02,839 --> 01:56:04,816
These people came
looking for the talisman.

2067
01:56:04,896 --> 01:56:07,225
They throw the bodies anywhere randomly.

2068
01:56:07,484 --> 01:56:09,558
Before they found the bodies..

2069
01:56:09,638 --> 01:56:13,296
..Ajay and Harsha found the bodies in
Ongole and I spotted one at Venkatachalam.

2070
01:56:13,512 --> 01:56:14,895
They must've spotted
us with the dead bodies.

2071
01:56:15,089 --> 01:56:16,968
What's wrong if the talisman is found?

2072
01:56:17,048 --> 01:56:19,701
I need the details of your ex-students
Ajay and Harsha regarding a case.

2073
01:56:19,781 --> 01:56:22,888
Their classmate works
a lecturer in our college.

2074
01:56:23,114 --> 01:56:25,285
I think she can help you.

2075
01:56:25,533 --> 01:56:27,218
Raghu, take them to her.

2076
01:56:31,657 --> 01:56:32,704
Go to Atreya's office.

2077
01:56:34,022 --> 01:56:36,053
Why are they worried about this talisman?

2078
01:56:36,690 --> 01:56:39,433
There's some connection between
these people and this talisman.

2079
01:56:39,628 --> 01:56:41,161
What's the connection?

2080
01:56:41,241 --> 01:56:42,997
What's the connection?

2081
01:56:43,494 --> 01:56:44,844
What do we know about these people?

2082
01:56:45,211 --> 01:56:47,922
They fool people by promising
to cremate dead bodies in Varanasi.

2083
01:56:48,002 --> 01:56:49,380
They are also involved
in another serious crime with it.

2084
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:51,908
They're misusing the name of God.

2085
01:56:51,988 --> 01:56:54,899
Sai Baba industries,
Balaji textile and what not.

2086
01:56:56,638 --> 01:56:58,799
What if they run their business
in the name of the goddess?

2087
01:56:59,987 --> 01:57:02,276
This maybe the logo of their company.

2088
01:57:04,566 --> 01:57:05,225
Do something.

2089
01:57:05,305 --> 01:57:08,659
Find the businesses run in the
locality in the name of the goddess.

2090
01:57:08,739 --> 01:57:12,764
Make the list of small shops
and businesses. Do it quickly.

2091
01:57:12,844 --> 01:57:14,492
Something must be common between them.

2092
01:57:14,741 --> 01:57:16,706
For instance friends or enemies.

2093
01:57:16,901 --> 01:57:19,644
Were they involved in
any mishap that you remember?

2094
01:57:19,724 --> 01:57:20,811
Nothing like that.

2095
01:57:20,891 --> 01:57:22,885
They worked together
on the final year project.

2096
01:57:22,965 --> 01:57:24,483
What was that project about?

2097
01:57:24,563 --> 01:57:25,790
Can I check that record?

2098
01:57:28,372 --> 01:57:29,225
Here it is.

2099
01:57:32,703 --> 01:57:34,431
Was it on religious crimes in India?
- Yes.

2100
01:57:34,511 --> 01:57:37,736
They wrote their paper on how criminals
fool people in the name of religion.

2101
01:57:37,816 --> 01:57:40,199
They worked on this
topic for almost six months.

2102
01:57:41,355 --> 01:57:42,219
Vasudha?

2103
01:57:42,435 --> 01:57:43,602
Vasudha was their friend.

2104
01:57:43,682 --> 01:57:45,319
Three of them worked on this project.

2105
01:57:45,632 --> 01:57:47,555
It means all three of them were friends.

2106
01:57:47,635 --> 01:57:50,687
It means all three of
them knew about this crime.

2107
01:57:51,724 --> 01:57:54,035
That's why all three of them were killed.

2108
01:57:55,731 --> 01:57:57,999
You'll get more details in this file.

2109
01:58:01,229 --> 01:58:04,102
Ma'am, can I take these
photos and project materials?

2110
01:58:13,931 --> 01:58:14,947
Here it is.

2111
01:58:17,928 --> 01:58:19,375
Is this a goddess?
- Yes.

2112
01:58:19,455 --> 01:58:21,049
Bethaballi Amman milk dairy.

2113
01:58:21,129 --> 01:58:22,778
Bethaballi Amman textiles.

2114
01:58:23,296 --> 01:58:25,079
Bethaballi Amman NGO.

2115
01:58:31,570 --> 01:58:33,503
Did you get any information from college?
- Yes, agent.

2116
01:58:33,583 --> 01:58:36,474
Ajay, Harsha and Vasudha were
classmates and very good friends.

2117
01:58:36,554 --> 01:58:37,446
What?
- Yes.

2118
01:58:37,526 --> 01:58:40,632
This college project is
common between the three of them.

2119
01:58:41,021 --> 01:58:42,393
Religious crimes in India.

2120
01:58:43,062 --> 01:58:44,186
Here are few photos.

2121
01:58:48,074 --> 01:58:50,061
Since they worked on
religious crimes in India..

2122
01:58:50,141 --> 01:58:51,994
..I'm sure they knew about this crime.

2123
01:58:53,776 --> 01:58:54,889
So, they were killed.

2124
01:58:58,054 --> 01:58:59,231
Business of dead bodies.

2125
01:59:00,463 --> 01:59:01,996
They're very smart.

2126
01:59:02,364 --> 01:59:04,297
The bodies are already dead.

2127
01:59:05,365 --> 01:59:07,374
No complaint, no risk.

2128
01:59:10,291 --> 01:59:11,177
What did you say?

2129
01:59:11,393 --> 01:59:14,633
The relatives think that
the bodies have been taken to Kashi.

2130
01:59:15,087 --> 01:59:16,772
Then who'll file a complaint?

2131
01:59:54,056 --> 01:59:55,579
No missing complaint
was made about the bodies..

2132
01:59:55,659 --> 01:59:56,897
..found near railway tracks. Right?

2133
01:59:58,420 --> 01:59:59,716
Except one body.

2134
01:59:59,796 --> 02:00:00,818
Whose body, agent?

2135
02:00:00,898 --> 02:00:01,768
The body found at Kawali.

2136
02:00:02,017 --> 02:00:03,788
The father registered a missing complaint.

2137
02:00:04,188 --> 02:00:07,136
Red dress.
Tattoo of the mother on the girl's hand.

2138
02:00:09,037 --> 02:00:09,847
Tell me something, sir.

2139
02:00:11,435 --> 02:00:13,217
The tattoo she made when she was a child..

2140
02:00:13,401 --> 02:00:14,935
..was also found on her dead body.

2141
02:00:17,807 --> 02:00:19,362
Why did it disappear from this photo?

2142
02:00:24,396 --> 02:00:26,308
That's because Vasudha is still alive.

2143
02:00:26,934 --> 02:00:29,062
The father and the daughter
are the masterminds.

2144
02:00:39,258 --> 02:00:42,930
If Vasudha is alive then why
did they pretend that she's dead.

2145
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:46,614
They made me believe that
a girl named Divya was killed.

2146
02:00:46,863 --> 02:00:48,569
I was framed for Ajay and Harsha's murder.

2147
02:00:49,509 --> 02:00:50,891
If this plan worked then
I would've been sentenced..

2148
02:00:50,971 --> 02:00:52,641
..for at least ten years.

2149
02:00:52,987 --> 02:00:54,844
But, there were two mistakes in this plan.

2150
02:00:55,729 --> 02:00:57,728
The first one was that I found Divya.

2151
02:00:58,375 --> 02:01:00,762
Second one is that I've
a CCTV footage of myself..

2152
02:01:00,842 --> 02:01:02,879
..of the time when Ajay was killed.

2153
02:01:03,214 --> 02:01:04,586
So, I got bail.

2154
02:01:04,666 --> 02:01:06,725
It was only Ajay and Harsha before.

2155
02:01:07,092 --> 02:01:09,209
But now Atreya is also dangerous for us.

2156
02:01:10,668 --> 02:01:12,688
If the three of them ever
meet then the information..

2157
02:01:12,768 --> 02:01:16,673
..Atreya has will go to Ajay and Harsha.

2158
02:01:18,876 --> 02:01:21,728
If they investigate then they'll
find the secret behind the talisman.

2159
02:01:22,613 --> 02:01:27,064
If they find the talisman they'll find us.

2160
02:01:27,691 --> 02:01:28,804
Where's Gopalam?

2161
02:01:29,419 --> 02:01:32,681
Tell him to get a photo of a missing girl.

2162
02:01:32,761 --> 02:01:36,645
Tell him to give her the name
Divya and tell Atreya the story I said.

2163
02:01:36,958 --> 02:01:38,622
Along with Ajay and Harsha's
number give him one of my numbers..

2164
02:01:38,702 --> 02:01:40,814
..which doesn't have a photo record.

2165
02:01:40,894 --> 02:01:41,905
Didn't you get a photo with this number?

2166
02:01:42,381 --> 02:01:44,044
The photo of the third person
isn't available in the database.

2167
02:01:44,124 --> 02:01:47,997
Atreya will find every
detail of the three numbers.

2168
02:01:49,078 --> 02:01:51,227
He'll definitely try
to find all three of us.

2169
02:01:51,821 --> 02:01:54,187
When he'll fail to get
any information about me.

2170
02:01:54,267 --> 02:01:56,671
He'll concentrate on Ajay and Harsha.

2171
02:01:57,579 --> 02:01:59,545
We'll kill Ajay and Harsha after that.

2172
02:01:59,901 --> 02:02:02,482
We'll keep creating
evidence against Atreya.

2173
02:02:03,249 --> 02:02:06,738
Atreya will be arrested
for killing Ajay and Harsha.

2174
02:02:07,764 --> 02:02:10,540
Their plan failed because I got bail.

2175
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:13,467
If I went to Ajay and Harsha's
college to investigate their murder..

2176
02:02:13,547 --> 02:02:15,929
..then I would've found out
that Vasudha was their classmate.

2177
02:02:16,009 --> 02:02:20,045
They made another plan to
divert my attention from Vasudha.

2178
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:23,955
They assured me that Vasudha is dead.

2179
02:02:24,431 --> 02:02:25,576
They went to the police station.

2180
02:02:25,824 --> 02:02:27,227
The father registered a
police complaint stating that..

2181
02:02:27,307 --> 02:02:28,242
..his daughter's life was in danger.

2182
02:02:28,556 --> 02:02:30,166
Then he came and filed
his daughter's missing complaint.

2183
02:02:30,415 --> 02:02:32,532
All of us were trying to save Vasudha.

2184
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:36,193
When her dad showed us a dead
body we believed that Vasudha was dead.

2185
02:02:36,273 --> 02:02:39,001
The drama would've ended with
the news of three criminology students..

2186
02:02:39,081 --> 02:02:42,824
..being killed while
investigating a religious crime.

2187
02:02:44,629 --> 02:02:47,027
How did Atreya doubt Gopalam?

2188
02:02:48,073 --> 02:02:49,478
I'm sure we made some mistake.

2189
02:02:50,223 --> 02:02:53,863
He'll hardly take a couple
of days to expose our business.

2190
02:02:53,943 --> 02:02:56,099
I thought that the matter would
be sorted by getting him arrested.

2191
02:02:56,315 --> 02:02:58,778
But the CCTV footage helped him get bail.

2192
02:02:59,145 --> 02:03:02,201
Kill him before he goes to jail again.

2193
02:03:02,385 --> 02:03:04,189
Hassan is a detective from Karnataka.

2194
02:03:04,437 --> 02:03:05,625
Set him after Atreya.

2195
02:03:05,992 --> 02:03:09,589
Do the same things
we did for Ajay and Harsha.

2196
02:03:09,827 --> 02:03:12,549
The police should find
drug packets in their houses.

2197
02:03:12,629 --> 02:03:14,687
This should look like
the work of a drug mafia.

2198
02:03:14,767 --> 02:03:16,405
Let's file a fake police
complaint stating that..

2199
02:03:16,485 --> 02:03:17,895
..we're getting death threats.

2200
02:03:18,111 --> 02:03:20,001
After that we'll fake my death.

2201
02:03:20,250 --> 02:03:23,642
I'll provide a number which
doesn't have a photo record.

2202
02:03:23,847 --> 02:03:26,547
When Atreya will find out
about my death he'll think that..

2203
02:03:26,627 --> 02:03:29,712
..the people who killed
Ajay and Harsha have killed me.

2204
02:03:30,025 --> 02:03:34,691
Even if he goes to college
to get our detail, we'll be safe.

2205
02:03:35,026 --> 02:03:39,509
Three criminology graduates,
experts of religious crimes.

2206
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:42,457
Ones who knew a lot about crimes.

2207
02:03:43,321 --> 02:03:45,471
Ajay and Harsha used their
knowledge for a good purpose.

2208
02:03:46,475 --> 02:03:47,814
But, this girl used it for evil purpose.

2209
02:03:48,279 --> 02:03:49,629
We're safe this time.

2210
02:03:49,964 --> 02:03:51,778
But, we can't take this risk again.

2211
02:03:52,071 --> 02:03:55,279
If we bury the dead bodies
they'll get exposed at some time.

2212
02:03:55,581 --> 02:03:57,612
Let's take advantage of the
loophole in railway department.

2213
02:03:57,817 --> 02:04:01,414
If they find a dead
body they wait for 72 hours.

2214
02:04:01,738 --> 02:04:05,475
If nobody claims the body they cremate it.

2215
02:04:22,616 --> 02:04:24,085
Call me if you face any problem.

2216
02:04:29,043 --> 02:04:31,786
People who fool others
and rob them follow a technique.

2217
02:04:32,985 --> 02:04:35,523
They give a lot of donations
to create a good image in the society.

2218
02:04:35,603 --> 02:04:39,336
It maybe distributing food,
opening a hospital, blood donation camps.

2219
02:04:39,416 --> 02:04:42,501
Anything they can do to
win the confidence of people.

2220
02:04:43,074 --> 02:04:45,569
All the details are mentioned
in this religious crime project.

2221
02:04:46,638 --> 02:04:50,008
They're also using a
technique to hide their crime.

2222
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:53,712
The technique is Bethaballi Amman NGO.

2223
02:05:26,613 --> 02:05:28,018
Bobby, go in that direction.

2224
02:05:39,154 --> 02:05:39,748
Bobby.

2225
02:05:40,904 --> 02:05:42,805
Sneha.
- There's nobody here, agent.

2226
02:05:57,323 --> 02:06:00,509
She escaped from here
after we caught Gopalam.

2227
02:06:01,772 --> 02:06:02,852
We are late.

2228
02:06:03,792 --> 02:06:04,516
She has escaped.

2229
02:06:04,807 --> 02:06:05,963
Let's go to Rajasthan.

2230
02:06:06,319 --> 02:06:08,804
Why will we go to Rajasthan?
- To catch Vasudha.

2231
02:06:09,322 --> 02:06:10,791
But, what's there in Rajasthan?

2232
02:06:11,158 --> 02:06:12,994
Do I need to explain everything?

2233
02:06:13,188 --> 02:06:16,126
You've followed all
my instructions properly.

2234
02:06:16,871 --> 02:06:18,751
I think we're safe now.

2235
02:06:19,356 --> 02:06:20,954
Everything is going on well till now.

2236
02:06:21,034 --> 02:06:22,207
What next?

2237
02:06:24,141 --> 02:06:25,793
I'll tell you what the next plan will be.

2238
02:06:40,503 --> 02:06:41,648
Look at the beer bottles.

2239
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:44,176
Somebody drank it half
and left it just like that.

2240
02:06:44,381 --> 02:06:45,818
That's because they left in a hurry.

2241
02:06:46,153 --> 02:06:48,615
The land is wet which
means it rained in the morning.

2242
02:06:48,885 --> 02:06:51,153
They tried to burn the evidence
but the fire is still burning.

2243
02:06:51,233 --> 02:06:52,903
The fire was lit after the rain stopped.

2244
02:06:53,302 --> 02:06:54,695
It's been only a couple of hours.

2245
02:06:54,922 --> 02:06:56,121
Look at the footprints.

2246
02:06:56,316 --> 02:06:58,163
Three people have left the NGO.

2247
02:06:58,530 --> 02:07:01,436
But, there are no tire marks.

2248
02:07:01,516 --> 02:07:02,721
It means they didn't take the road.

2249
02:07:02,893 --> 02:07:06,004
There's only one option
to escape from here quickly.

2250
02:07:06,901 --> 02:07:08,089
It's the railway station.

2251
02:07:08,327 --> 02:07:11,718
It's very clear from this place
that they were here an hour ago.

2252
02:07:11,798 --> 02:07:14,558
Only one train has left
the station within an hour.

2253
02:07:15,033 --> 02:07:17,993
A train to Bikaner, Rajasthan.

2254
02:07:20,434 --> 02:07:22,810
Last week you booked your
mom's ticket to Rajasthan.

2255
02:07:23,026 --> 02:07:23,696
Yes, agent.

2256
02:07:23,869 --> 02:07:26,666
We're going to Karnimata
festival by this train next week.

2257
02:07:26,746 --> 02:07:29,593
Exactly! People believe that
the goddess comes in the form of a rat..

2258
02:07:29,673 --> 02:07:30,867
..during this festival.

2259
02:07:31,116 --> 02:07:35,263
People who believe this will go
there from different parts of the world.

2260
02:07:35,479 --> 02:07:38,558
These people are easy targets
for people like Vasudha.

2261
02:07:41,928 --> 02:07:43,138
I've solved the case.

2262
02:07:43,743 --> 02:07:44,941
I'll take a selfie now.

2263
02:07:46,442 --> 02:07:47,479
Hey! Hey!

2264
02:07:48,916 --> 02:07:50,806
What's wrong, auntie? C'mon smile.

2265
02:07:51,519 --> 02:07:52,912
It seems that somebody has died.

2266
02:07:54,165 --> 02:07:55,677
But, you're happy when anybody dies..

2267
02:07:55,936 --> 02:07:58,064
..because you get a new
finger print that you can sell.

2268
02:07:59,435 --> 02:08:01,120
Mentally retarded criminal.

2269
02:08:01,995 --> 02:08:04,868
Uncle, come and click a photo with me.

2270
02:08:05,235 --> 02:08:06,715
Why are you feeling shy?
Come on.

2271
02:08:09,814 --> 02:08:11,888
Vasudha, my daughter is dead.

2272
02:08:11,968 --> 02:08:13,303
They killed my daughter.

2273
02:08:13,854 --> 02:08:15,117
Petty actor.

2274
02:08:15,657 --> 02:08:19,006
A father slaps his children
to teach them something good.

2275
02:08:19,578 --> 02:08:21,371
Instead of that you've brought
your daughter to Rajasthan..

2276
02:08:21,451 --> 02:08:23,478
..to start a new business.
I'll thrash you badly.

2277
02:08:24,374 --> 02:08:25,562
Both the father and daughter are mad.

2278
02:08:26,221 --> 02:08:26,891
Come on.

2279
02:08:27,290 --> 02:08:29,224
The goddess will come in the
form of a rat when you're in jail.

2280
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:32,269
You'll get white rat,
black rat, all varieties of rat.

2281
02:08:32,349 --> 02:08:33,036
You can behold them.

2282
02:08:33,116 --> 02:08:34,634
Agent.
- Yes. Come and join us.

2283
02:08:34,714 --> 02:08:35,650
Don't feel shy.

2284
02:08:40,327 --> 02:08:40,846
Let's go.

2285
02:08:40,926 --> 02:08:42,358
Thank you.
- No problem, sir.

2286
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:44,896
What's going on, sir?

2287
02:08:45,123 --> 02:08:46,646
Okay, agent. I'll leave now.

2288
02:08:46,894 --> 02:08:48,676
My train will leave in a couple of hours.

2289
02:08:48,849 --> 02:08:50,178
If you need any help think of me.

2290
02:08:50,258 --> 02:08:51,290
Hassan, Karnataka.

2291
02:08:51,370 --> 02:08:52,360
My headquarters are located there.

2292
02:08:52,695 --> 02:08:55,125
Ask about the famous detective
and they'll guide you to me.

2293
02:08:55,524 --> 02:08:56,410
Okay, bye.
- Okay.

2294
02:08:56,626 --> 02:08:57,393
Hold on.

2295
02:09:00,385 --> 02:09:03,625
It was a pleasure working with you,
Agent Bobby.

2296
02:09:04,251 --> 02:09:05,547
Like my page on social media.

2297
02:09:07,783 --> 02:09:09,781
Bye.
- Bye.

2298
02:09:10,149 --> 02:09:11,650
Sir, you've contacts in Rajasthan?

2299
02:09:11,730 --> 02:09:12,590
The department has contacts everywhere.

2300
02:09:28,759 --> 02:09:31,600
You know that your mother
wasn't cremated here.

2301
02:09:32,064 --> 02:09:33,306
Then why do you always come here?

2302
02:09:35,154 --> 02:09:38,027
Only agent Atreya knows
that Mahalakshmi is not here.

2303
02:09:39,550 --> 02:09:41,246
But, Mahalakshmi's
son Seenu doesn't know it.

2304
02:09:50,081 --> 02:09:53,894
How did they manage to fool
so many people and run their business?

2305
02:09:54,542 --> 02:09:57,037
People believe anything
if you tie a talisman on them.

2306
02:09:57,901 --> 02:10:00,126
We think that black cat is a bad omen.

2307
02:10:01,022 --> 02:10:03,085
Some people believe that human sacrifice..

2308
02:10:03,165 --> 02:10:05,537
..can help you get treasure
or avoid ghosts and spirits.

2309
02:10:06,444 --> 02:10:08,086
Everybody wants their well-being.

2310
02:10:08,464 --> 02:10:10,322
They don't want anything
bad in their life.

2311
02:10:10,732 --> 02:10:13,217
This fear forces humans
to believe in anything.

2312
02:10:14,275 --> 02:10:16,435
They were not fooling people.

2313
02:10:16,608 --> 02:10:18,001
They were betraying their belief.

2314
02:11:24,644 --> 02:11:26,923
I was watching 'Bahubali
2' on Goldmine last night.

2315
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:31,687
Do you know that I solved why
Katappa killed Bahubali long back?

2316
02:11:31,979 --> 02:11:34,495
I knew the answer well before
Rajamouli sir wrote the script.

2317
02:11:35,230 --> 02:11:36,839
Why did Katappa kill Bahubali?

2318
02:11:37,573 --> 02:11:39,841
Haven't you watched Bahubali?
- No.

2319
02:11:53,516 --> 02:11:54,801
Why did Katappa kill Bahubali?

2320
02:11:54,881 --> 02:11:56,681
The victim fell down
from the building last night.

2321
02:11:57,059 --> 02:11:59,090
People think that he jumped
early in the morning at 4 am.

2322
02:11:59,305 --> 02:12:01,098
We need to find out if it's
a suicide or murder. Let's go.

2323
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:08,325
We got no clue.

2324
02:12:08,584 --> 02:12:09,837
Then what did you get?
- Murder weapon.

2325
02:12:09,917 --> 02:12:11,716
FBI.
- FBI?

2326
02:12:12,127 --> 02:12:13,023
Isn't FBI in America?

2327
02:12:13,207 --> 02:12:14,741
Fatima Bureau of Investigation.

2328
02:12:15,551 --> 02:12:17,657
Fatima was my first girlfriend.

2329
02:12:17,982 --> 02:12:20,055
Our head office is
near the vegetable market.

2330
02:12:20,434 --> 02:12:22,216
We give discount to the police department.

2331
02:12:23,253 --> 02:12:27,054
Please. Take my card.

2332
02:12:28,037 --> 02:12:29,128
Do visit me.

2333
02:12:35,317 --> 02:12:36,829
The case has been solved.

2334
02:12:39,184 --> 02:12:40,361
Take back the empty box.

2335
02:12:40,441 --> 02:12:41,571
Case solved.

2336
02:13:00,784 --> 02:13:02,177
Sir, did it hurt?

2337
02:13:02,257 --> 02:13:04,370
Actually Katappa killed Bahubali because..
