1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,530
- For thousands of years,

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,510
humans have tried to fly like birds.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,410
- We can't do it.

4
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,840
- We couldn't before, but we can now.

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,340
- We can?
- Watch this clip.

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,290
Oh my goodness!

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,490
He is literally flying.

8
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,323
Tell me, what's the difference

9
00:00:12,323 --> 00:00:13,650
between this gentleman here and Superman?

10
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,390
- This guy has probably
a million dollar suit on.

11
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,530
More of a Ironman really.

12
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,060
- I just wanna make sure it's very clear.

13
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,320
I've never seen Superman

14
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,030
and this guy flying at the same time.

15
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,863
- That's true.

16
00:00:21,863 --> 00:00:22,770
All right, this is a little speedboat.

17
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,979
The sea breacher.

18
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:24,812
It looks like a whale.

19
00:00:24,812 --> 00:00:26,261
Oh my God!
- A whale boat!

20
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:27,409
Whale boat!
- It's so cute!

21
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:29,160
- Wait, since when were
whale boat's a thing?

22
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,930
- I don't even want the
flying thing anymore.

23
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,130
I just want this cute thing.

24
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:32,963
- Comment down below.

25
00:00:32,963 --> 00:00:34,200
Whale boat or flying thing?

26
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,033
- Whale boat.

27
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:36,240
- What happens if you just--
- Whoa!

28
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,320
Yeah, whale boat all day.

29
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,790
- Aww! The whale boat lost its owner.

30
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,050
- Its nose is waiting for me.

31
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,370
All right. Boston Dynamics.

32
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,390
Everybody's seen them.

33
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,500
Let's see what it can--

34
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,700
- Oh.

35
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,110
Oh, that's smooth.

36
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,760
- It is more nimble than us.
- Oh my God!

37
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,630
We need to be careful.

38
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,310
Boston Dynamics might take over the world.

39
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,020
So now we got a plane.

40
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,250
- How's this allowed?

41
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,530
- Those guys are flying by themselves.

42
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,790
- With those jet packs.

43
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,310
- What?
- This is some GTA 5 stuff.

44
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,200
- Oh my goodness!

45
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,240
Dude, they're getting
so close to the plane.

46
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,110
Dude, chill out.

47
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,400
- Dude. That just goes to show you.

48
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,930
In Dubai, if you got enough money

49
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,760
you can do literally anything you want.

50
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,230
- That's probably the coolest
thing I've seen all day.

51
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,460
- You know what's really cool?
- What?

52
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,230
- Slow-mo shot walking outta the water.

53
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,580
Oh wait, he's not walking.

54
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,413
- He's flying.

55
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:16,603
You idiot.
- What? I'm stupid.

56
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:18,900
- Nicompoop!
- I'm just so dumb.

57
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,250
These things are so hard to use.

58
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,180
Have you ever seen people

59
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,560
that don't know how to use them use them?

60
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,580
- I feel like I would just drown.

61
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,560
- They'd just go, " ".

62
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,330
Oh, he's just dropping this guy.

63
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,160
- Bye bye.
- That's so humiliating.

64
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,590
Just getting dropped
by the flying cool guy.

65
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,490
- He's dumping man.

66
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,420
- There's no way that's real.

67
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,740
I refuse.
- Flying bike!

68
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,840
- Does it turn into a normal bike, please?

69
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,543
God!

70
00:01:38,543 --> 00:01:39,690
Oh, I need it.

71
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,850
This is definitely the car you unlock

72
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,280
at the end of some James Bond video game.

73
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,440
- No way! Is this actually a flying car?

74
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,160
No.
- This is so cool.

75
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,720
- Is that spinny thing
usually on the front?

76
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,553
- The propeller?
- Yeah.

77
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:51,870
- Yeah, usually. Except
for this is a flying car.

78
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,980
- Oh my God!

79
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,240
- That is so cool.

80
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,910
- I'm gonna go rob a bang and
then just get away with this.

81
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,290
- That is so cool.

82
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,699
- Bravo to whoever built that.

83
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:01,560
First I thought that was a real person.

84
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,140
- It's a plasma torch style lightsaber.

85
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,160
- AKA lightsaber.

86
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,810
- Hack Smith, please let me use it.

87
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,980
- I meant to reach out to him

88
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,360
to ask if we could borrow his lightsaber.

89
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,260
I think I forgot though.

90
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,180
- You should remember to
do something like that.

91
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,013
Look at this.

92
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:14,010
You forgot this?

93
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,500
If we had this when we were
doing the bounty hunter video

94
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,910
it would've been over instantly.

95
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,550
What would you have done if
I had somehow contacted--

96
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,200
- Yeah. Oh yeah when I
was stuck in the save.

97
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,130
And you had that? Oh!
- Yeah.

98
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,080
- I mean I just would've ran
out the secret door faster.

99
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,100
- It's the drone.

100
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,720
It's the pizza delivery drone.

101
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,553
Oh my God!

102
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:29,640
- You're telling me there's pizza drone?

103
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,130
- Yes. I want this in my neighborhood.

104
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,090
It gives you your little pizza

105
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,435
and it keeps it warm in the pizza warmer.

106
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:36,360
- Whoa!
- Oh, get pushed over.

107
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,302
You stupid robot.

108
00:02:37,302 --> 00:02:38,160
- A dog!

109
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,050
Do you want robots to take over?

110
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,370
- How about you stop being an idiot?

111
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,390
- Jimmy? He's getting up.

112
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,030
It was the one thing robots
were never able to do.

113
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,170
They can do it now.

114
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,003
They can get up.

115
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:47,836
- Oh, you pushed me down?

116
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:49,200
I'll just run away.
- I'm leaving.

117
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,060
- This looks like a
sad scene from a movie.

118
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,990
- Jimmy?
- Yes, Chris.

119
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,823
- I found your car.

120
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:53,656
You need this.

121
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:54,840
- Oh my God!

122
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,938
- The tires were enough
reason that you get this car.

123
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:59,220
- Controls are.
- Crab car.

124
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,470
Yo, he's literally surfing on a drone.

125
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,340
That's so cool.

126
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,440
I never would've thought to
do that, but now I want to.

127
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,580
Oh and there's a disclaimer.

128
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,660
I can't replicate this.

129
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,010
They're dancing!

130
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,090
- Robot dance party!

131
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,230
- Yeah!

132
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,250
This makes me happy.

133
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,040
- I personally accept our robot overlords

134
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,690
and I'm looking forward to serving them.

135
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,523
Please spare me.

136
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:18,030
- As long as I get to make
YouTube videos, I'll be fine.

137
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,927
I just love how that guy
right up there is just like,

138
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:21,420
"Yes, dance for me robot."

139
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,817
- And they're like, "Ah! It hurts."

140
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,750
I love the dog one.

141
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,550
He's really--
- I also love the guy

142
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,907
in the background just walking away like,

143
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,247
"Yeah. I've seen the robot
dance party a thousand times.

144
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:31,170
"Nothing special."

145
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,240
- This seems like it would
be a part of a movie.

146
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,073
It's all happy.

147
00:03:34,073 --> 00:03:35,940
And then all of a sudden the music stops.

148
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,140
Their lights turn red.

149
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,577
- Yeah. And they just start
taking over the world.

150
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:40,170
- And this one is like the leader

151
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,407
'cause he is like the snake
and he is really smart.

152
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:43,260
Oh no!

153
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,100
- No! Robots!

154
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,300
How many robots do they have?

155
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,560
- Yo, he's racing a Lamborghini.

156
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,820
- Who's faster Lamborghini or--

157
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,653
- Fly guy?

158
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:49,770
- Ooh, that fly guy just fell off.

159
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,603
- I don't think he can.

160
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:51,840
I think he's like locked to it.

161
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,730
That's so cool.
- It's so dangerous.

162
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:54,667
- He only lived one life.

163
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,687
"I just had a little fun.

164
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:57,187
"Fly through the sky every now and again

165
00:03:57,187 --> 00:03:59,220
"at ridiculous breakneck speeds."

166
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,050
- Is this an ad?
- No, this is a video.

167
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,090
Razor made of masks.

168
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,150
It just goes to show gamers
will put RGB on anything.

169
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,100
- Anything. Yeah.
- Literally anything.

170
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,933
They got me though.

171
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:09,766
I want it.

172
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:11,220
This is just something some guy made.

173
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,053
This is cool.

174
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:13,440
- It looks like the
thing from Tron: Legacy.

175
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,273
- Yeah, it does.

176
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:15,106
- I feel like he's not going that fast.

177
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:16,152
- No, I was about to say that.

178
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:17,700
- Like I feel like I could
walk faster than this.

179
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,750
- But you have to think.

180
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,850
I mean he's probably
doesn't wanna go too fast

181
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,470
'cause it looks really dangerous.

182
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,180
- He's just on a rotating tire.

183
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,080
- That he built that.

184
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,100
That's so crazy.

185
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,590
Yo, did this guy just
interrupt a soccer match?

186
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,760
- Is this planned or not?

187
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,690
This is planned, yeah.

188
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,460
- Oh wait, he's delivering the ball.

189
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,293
- No way.

190
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:34,350
- That's so cool.
- That's cool.

191
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,240
Man, this guy probably
has a lot of girlfriends.

192
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,390
It's a shame if he only
has one girlfriend.

193
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,630
- Oh, that's when you wanna
reveal your full face.

194
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,463
That was really cool.

195
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:44,970
- Drone bike.
- Dubai Police.

196
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,880
The Dubai police is gonna
fly through on drones?

197
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,750
- Oh my God!

198
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,610
- You're trying to steal
some old lady's purse.

199
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,113
- And then--
- Drone force!

200
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,960
You thinking of Mackerel or shrimp?

201
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,890
- I'm thinking of U-Tube.

202
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,720
- Just the capital U.
- Yeah, it is.

203
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,520
I wonder if people working
at YouTube sees this video

204
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,353
and they're like, " ".

205
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:02,130
- They were like, " We
were gonna sue him but."

206
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,030
- It's not YouTube.

207
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,863
It's U-Tube.

208
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:05,130
- Whoa! Mini helicopter.

209
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,720
- If there's one thing
I've learned today is that

210
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,100
literally anything can fly.

211
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,050
A car, a jet pack, a bike, anything.

212
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,883
- Even man.

213
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:12,960
- I wonder if he prefers
flying over land or water?

214
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,150
- Water. 'Cause if you fall,
water doesn't hurt as bad,

215
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,190
I guess, and then is he just gonna land?

216
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,870
- No way.
- He lands on the Rock.

217
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,890
- No, that wasn't the Rock.

218
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,723
That was a rock.

219
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:22,740
- Oh, the Rock is probably
busy filming a movie

220
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,880
or something.
- Exactly. Exactly.

221
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,890
This robot's good at Minecraft Parkour.

222
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,847
- This is the next dream.

223
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:28,770
- Yes. This is dream Iro.

224
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,270
I mean, dream hasn't done a face reveal.

225
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,920
For all we know, this could be Dream.

226
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,200
- Dream actually might just
be a robot we don't know yet.

227
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,033
Oh gosh!

228
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,060
No. I don't like this.

229
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,700
Microsoft can own every
fabric of your life.

230
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,260
- I want this.
- You want holograms?

231
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,093
- Of course.

232
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:43,260
- Once they can implement
it to video games.

233
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,940
- 12 seconds later.

234
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,773
- Oh, there it is.

235
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:46,680
Okay. Yeah, you got me.

236
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,850
It's cool. All right now it's fine.

237
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,080
All right. Nevermind, Microsoft.

238
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,090
You can have every right to my body.

239
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:51,923
- Wait.

240
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:54,067
- The Marines were like,
"We need Jet to go fast.

241
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,920
"Fast from beginning. At all times fast."

242
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,187
- They're like, "How can we get this plane

243
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:58,140
"to ascend fast?"

244
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,220
- Explosions!

245
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,570
- The plane's literally on fire.

246
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,760
- It really does look, not look okay.

247
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,840
Like, oh and now it's fine.

248
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,220
- Yo, I love these things.

249
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,053
Do you know what these are?

250
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:07,800
- No. What is this?
- So it's an artist

251
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,260
and he builds these contraptions
that move on their own

252
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,093
on the beach.

253
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:12,000
- They propel their-self.

254
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,833
- With wind.

255
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,010
- That's so cool.

256
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,210
It looks like a creature.

257
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,410
- These things are crazy,

258
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,880
but sometimes the wind takes him over.

259
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,713
Guess what?

260
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:19,546
Another jet pack.

261
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,410
- But this one has wings
now instead of on his hand.

262
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,990
- Literally. How many
kinds of jet packs exist?

263
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,550
- 38.
- The Falcon Rocket Landing.

264
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,383
Yes.
- Yes.

265
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:28,216
- Land.

266
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:30,150
Land. Look at that vertical precision.

267
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,650
Elon Musk is perfect.

268
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,850
- Tell us how you really feel Jimmy.

269
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,800
- That's the Elon meme and let's go.

270
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,930
- Hey, you know what's
cooler than a rocket landing?

271
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,763
- Raft surfing?

272
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:38,727
- Raft hang glider playing.

273
00:06:38,727 --> 00:06:40,200
- Did you see? I gotta
look back at the camera.

274
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,430
He's like, "You, you getting this?"

275
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,470
- He's like, "That's cool, I guess."

276
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,390
It's kinda like the one
wheel but with two wheels.

277
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,500
Yeah. I'm gonna need that.

278
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,480
- You're gonna need a lot
of things from this video.

279
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,860
- If any of these companies

280
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,470
wanna send me any of these
things I'll take even this.

281
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,430
- What about giant moped?

282
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,510
- I don't know. It's kind of chunky.

283
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,920
Wait, that's a moped jet ski.

284
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,753
Yes!

285
00:06:56,753 --> 00:06:57,720
Yes, yes! Give it to me.

286
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,553
I don't care how goofy it looks.

287
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:00,240
- I was like, "I take it back too."

288
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,500
I was about to trash on it.

289
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,370
You should have started off

290
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,840
by telling us it was a moped jet ski.

291
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,740
- Yeah, like this shot.

292
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,573
Start with this.

293
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:06,406
This is how you sell this.

294
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:07,560
- Wow! It's that easy?

295
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,790
That's a smooth transition.

296
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,623
Robot man.

297
00:07:09,623 --> 00:07:10,620
- Is this a Honda robot?

298
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,790
- Honda made a robot.

299
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,140
- Wait, this is CGI, is it not?

300
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,160
- Oh, no. Asimo's real?

301
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,380
Yeah, Asimo's been in
development for a long time.

302
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,700
- Oh, CGI.
- No.

303
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,950
- Asimo more like Asim-no.

304
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,540
- No. Oh, he's sad.

305
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,590
Hey, who's this nerd?

306
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,460
- It's that guy no one like.

307
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,080
- He's definitely not cooler than us.

308
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,165
- He ruined vlogs.

309
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:27,480
Yeah. Anyways, I'm gonna call Casey.

310
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,740
I love that guy.
- Yeah, same.

311
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,540
- I miss when Casey
used to do these videos.

312
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,500
I don't think he does them--

313
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,333
Oh my God!

314
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,690
Casey, you are literally insane.

315
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,010
- This is literally Ironman.

316
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,750
This is like the Cave Ironman too.

317
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,280
Oh, this is gonna be so cool.

318
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,490
Imagine movies when this stuff
gets like more streamlined.

319
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,440
- Yeah, they don't even
have to CGI or anything.

320
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,273
You know what everybody?

321
00:07:44,273 --> 00:07:46,590
I'm gonna need you to hit that
subscribe button right now!

322
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,360
We are closing in on
10 million subscribers

323
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,610
and if we hit 10 million
subscribers, I'll be very happy.

324
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,870
- I will also be happy.

325
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,010
- Does this make you happy?

326
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:53,843
- Yes.
