1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,835
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,835 --> 00:00:03,751
One of the world's most courageous military commanders

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:08,700
widely recognized as the most powerful king in Europe.

4
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:17,121
was Napoleon Bonaparte.

5
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:20,113
However, he remains one of history's most controversial figures,

6
00:00:20,113 --> 00:00:23,466
with some praising his capabilities

7
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:28,698
while others criticize his hunger for power.

8
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:31,904
Questions about the immense loss of life attributed to him persist:

9
00:00:31,904 --> 00:00:33,298
What is the truth?

10
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:37,181
Was he a hero of the masses or the vilest of villains?

11
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:42,864
Director Ridley Scott is set to release 
a film titled 'Napoleon' on November 24th.

12
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:47,991
Scott, known for directing acclaimed films 
such as 'Gladiator,' 'The Martian,' and 'Prometheus,'

13
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:50,535
the trailer of the film promises an intriguing portrayal,

14
00:00:50,535 --> 00:00:54,229
featuring Joaquin Phoenix as Napoleon.

15
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:57,644
Phoenix notably played the role of 
Joker in the film of the same name.

16
00:00:57,644 --> 00:00:59,838
So I thought this is the perfect time

17
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:05,289
to get to know Napoleon Bonaparte's story.

18
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:18,361
Napoleon was born on 15th August 1769,

19
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:20,331
on the island of Corsica.

20
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:24,805
Look at the map, it is an island 
situated between France and Italy.

21
00:01:24,805 --> 00:01:28,364
Noteworthy for being the backdrop of the song Matargasti,

22
00:01:28,364 --> 00:01:31,112
from the film Tamasha starring 
Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone.

23
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:35,231
Corsica, during the 1700s,

24
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:38,731
was under the rule of a country that doesn't exist any longer.

25
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,731
Republic of Genoa.

26
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,093
This was the flag of the Republic of Genoa.

27
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:46,439
Several territories that are now part of Italy and Greece 

28
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,011
were under the control of this country.

29
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:50,269
One such territory was Corsica,

30
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:53,058
but the Corsicians were fed up with Genoan rule.

31
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:56,194
They were fueled by a burgeoning sense of nationalism

32
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:58,529
and a desire to live in a free country.

33
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:03,705
Pasquale Paoli emerged as a leader in 
the Corsican struggle for independence,

34
00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:06,652
and a young Napoleon embraced Corsican nationalism,

35
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:08,972
inspired by his childhood idol Paoli.

36
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:12,601
By the 1760s, Corsica found itself embroiled in war,

37
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:14,908
while the Republic of Genoa,

38
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:18,749
burdened by debt and war,

39
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:27,336
decided to literally sell the island of Corsica to France in 1768.

40
00:02:27,336 --> 00:02:29,925
This decision caused unrest among Corsican freedom fighters,

41
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:32,116
but there wasn't much that they could do.

42
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:35,724
Resisting the might of France's imperial power proved challenging.

43
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:40,086
The turning point came in 1769 when 
the French army clashed with Corsican forces.

44
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:42,242
During the Battle of Ponte Novu.

45
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:45,216
Following a swift victory, France 

46
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:48,459
claimed Corsica as its territory.

47
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,602
Shortly thereafter, Napoleon Bonaparte was born.

48
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:52,271
His father Carlo,

49
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:57,342
was a lawyer who initially fought 
alongside Corsican freedom fighters.

50
00:02:57,342 --> 00:03:00,286
But after the French army's triumph

51
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:02,917
Paoli had to flee the country.

52
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:06,614
And Carlo switched allegiance.

53
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:10,043
The shift was notable, as Carlo became an 
ardent supporter of the French royalty.

54
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:13,457
He used connections to make advances in his career.

55
00:03:13,457 --> 00:03:16,016
He secured the status of Nobility.

56
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:20,415
By 1777, he became Corsica's representative 

57
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:24,176
to the court of the new French king, Louis XVI.

58
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:26,444
This transformation bothered Napoleon.

59
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:28,691
He harboured no fondness for his father.

60
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:32,635
He viewed his father as a coward and deserter. 

61
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:39,001
But it was his father's connections that

62
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:41,840
Napoleon and his brother Joseph secured scholarships,

63
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,617
enabling Napoleon to enrol in the French Military College.

64
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:50,608
At the college, Napoleon was surrounded 
by the children of French aristocrats,

65
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:53,373
he faced ridicule at school

66
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:55,104
due to his distinctive accent.

67
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:57,821
Unfazed, he refrained from socialising with his peers,

68
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,521
viewing the French as colonizers.

69
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:06,423
His dream was to witness his country, Corsica achieve independence. 

70
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:11,372
Napoleon's isolation drove him to find solace in books,

71
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:16,503
particularly drawn to Enlightenment-age
philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau,

72
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:20,772
the primary reason for that was 
Rousseau wrote about Corsican freedom,

73
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:22,954
and considered the Corsicians brave in his writings.

74
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:24,410
In addition to philosophy,

75
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,281
Napoleon exhibited a keen interest in mathematics, history, and geography,

76
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:30,725
excelling in these subjects.

77
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:34,399
Among his favourite reads was Plutarch's 'Parallel Lives,'

78
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,161
a compilation of 45 biographies featuring historical figures

79
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:42,191
like Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar.

80
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:45,991
Napoleon found inspiration in Caesar, 
often drawing comparisons.

81
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:47,391
Upon completing his schooling,

82
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:49,602
Napoleon joined a military academy in Paris,

83
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:51,414
specializing in artillery.

84
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:57,334
Graduating as the second lieutenant 
of the Royal Artillery in the French army,

85
00:04:57,334 --> 00:05:01,150
during all of this, he would often return to Corsica

86
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,480
continuing to idolize Pasquale Paoli.

87
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,883
However, the landscape changed in 1789

88
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:09,734
with the onset of the French Revolution.

89
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:14,553
I have made a separate video on the French Revolution

90
00:05:14,553 --> 00:05:17,550
in case you haven't watched it,
you can watch it after this.

91
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,326
During this period, Corsica fell under the 
jurisdiction of the new French National Assembly,

92
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:24,742
leading to the pardon of Pasquale Paoli.

93
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,598
After a 20-year exile, Paoli returned,

94
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:30,605
and was greeted warmly by the people of Corsica

95
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:32,433
including Napoleon.

96
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:36,287
Subsequent elections in Corsica 
saw Pasquale Paoli emerge victorious,

97
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:37,892
becoming the President.

98
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:41,341
Despite Napoleon's 'traitorous' father having passed away by the time

99
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,346
and Napoleon holding Paoli in high regard,

100
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:48,183
Paoli harboured resentment toward Napoleon's family,

101
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:52,132
Consequently, Paoli declared that such 
traitorous families could not live in Corsica,

102
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:54,547
prompting Napoleon and his family

103
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:58,762
to relocate from Corsica to France

104
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:00,767
in June 1793.

105
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:05,062
Following this, Paoli severed ties with 
the French Revolutionary Assembly,

106
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:07,859
aligning himself with their enemy, the British.

107
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:10,303
This is why, in 1794,

108
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,284
the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom was established,

109
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:16,376
expelling France from Corsica

110
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,906
and rendering it a puppet state under British control.

111
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:21,869
However, this arrangement lasted only two years.

112
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:24,797
In 1796, France launched an attack,

113
00:06:24,797 --> 00:06:28,476
reclaiming Corsica from British rule.

114
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:31,214
Meanwhile, France was embroiled in a civil war,

115
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:33,750
marked by various factions of

116
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,790
French revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries.

117
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,095
People, divided into various groups,
were fighting among themselves.

118
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:43,684
In 1793, a political group named Jacobins,

119
00:06:43,684 --> 00:06:46,258
came to power and formed the French government.

120
00:06:46,258 --> 00:06:50,304
The group was led by Maximillien Robespierre.

121
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:51,378
During this tumultuous period,

122
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:55,928
Napoleon expressed his support for the 
Jacobin government in a political pamphlet.

123
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:59,394
This caught the attention of Robespierre's brother,

124
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:01,806
it greatly impressed him. 

125
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:05,033
This gave a boost to Napoleon's career prospects.

126
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,899
In September 1793, an event occurred that

127
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,092
further elevated Napoleon's popularity.

128
00:07:10,092 --> 00:07:12,346
Toulon, a French naval base,

129
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:16,391
witnessed an uprising by a group

130
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:19,771
and subsequent attacks by the British forces.

131
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:23,694
The French Army dispatched Napoleon 
to take command at this location.

132
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:27,364
Napoleon was then serving as 
Senior Gunner and Artillery Commander.

133
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,151
Napoleon proposed a strategic plan to win 
this conflict 

134
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:31,716
and shared it with his commanders.

135
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:34,598
The plan included capturing a fort,

136
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:39,287
securing a hill for artillery dominance,

137
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:42,651
and launching attacks on British ships.

138
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:49,341
His plan was executed

139
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:51,604
with Napoleon fighting with remarkable bravery,

140
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,497
and suffering significant injuries.

141
00:07:53,497 --> 00:07:56,276
but after three months of struggle,
the French army emerged victorious. 

142
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:59,406
The General of the French Army, Dugomere, 
speaking about Napoleon, stated

143
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:03,407
'I have no words to describe Bonaparte's merit:

144
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:07,730
much technical skill, an equal degree 
of intelligence, and too much gallantry...

145
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,095
Napoleon is an amazing man.'

146
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:12,825
In recognition of his contributions, Napoleon 
was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General

147
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,997
at the young age of 24.

148
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,484
During this period, France remained 
embroiled in a civil war,

149
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:25,032
and Maximilian Robespierre sought to implement reforms.

150
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:27,064
Such as universal male suffrage,

151
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:30,531
granting voting rights to all men above 18.

152
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:32,605
While women were not granted political rights,

153
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:35,097
significant reforms were instituted for them,

154
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,268
including the right to divorce

155
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:40,972
an option that was previously unavailable to women.

156
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:44,794
Additionally, women gained access to 
the right to education and work opportunities.

157
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:48,544
Robespierre's influence extended to the abolition of slavery in France

158
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:51,852
and the French colonies,

159
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:54,774
leaving a lasting impact reflected in

160
00:08:54,774 --> 00:09:00,541
numerous roads and metro stations 
named after him in France.

161
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,419
However, Robespierre's tenure was marked by controversy,

162
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,629
particularly because of the Reign of Terror.

163
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:12,281
In an effort to quash opposition to the French Revolution,

164
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:16,476
thousands were executed on suspicion alone,

165
00:09:16,476 --> 00:09:19,895
leading to the d3ath of at least 20,000 French citizens.

166
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:24,481
Simultaneously, the government initiated the 
dismantling of Catholic Christianity in France.

167
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:28,349
confiscating church properties

168
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:32,392
and promoting a singular Supreme God,

169
00:09:32,392 --> 00:09:37,614
to be revered through acts of service to the people.

170
00:09:37,614 --> 00:09:39,828
Amid these challenges and instability,

171
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:44,683
a coup unfolded in July 1794 against the Jacobins government,

172
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:47,328
resulting in its complete overthrow

173
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:50,120
and Robespierre's execution.

174
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,623
In August 1794, since Napoleon 
supported the toppled government,

175
00:09:54,623 --> 00:09:56,438
he was imprisoned.

176
00:09:56,438 --> 00:09:59,515
He vigorously defended himself,

177
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,465
securing his release from jail after only a few weeks.

178
00:10:02,465 --> 00:10:05,418
The orchestrator of this coup was 
the well-known figure, Paul Barras,

179
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:08,042
who had known Napoleon since the Siege of Toulon

180
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,122
and gradually developed a favourable opinion of him.

181
00:10:10,122 --> 00:10:13,816
In October 1795, Napoleon was entrusted with the task of

182
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:15,812
quelling a revolution,

183
00:10:15,812 --> 00:10:19,434
despite the French army facing 
a numerical disadvantage of 1 to 6.

184
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:23,647
Employing 40 cannons and limited infantry,

185
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:27,113
Napoleon successfully suppressed the uprising within 2 hours,

186
00:10:27,113 --> 00:10:31,369
This pleased Paul Barras,
who then gave him the title of General.

187
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,700
Napoleon became a national hero.

188
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:39,550
At just 27 years old,

189
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,652
he assumed the role of General in the French Army.

190
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,622
Shortly thereafter, he took command

191
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:45,106
of the Army of Italy,

192
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:46,672
not the Italian Army,

193
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:50,640
Rather the French forces operating in Italy.

194
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,284
They were known as the Army of Italy.

195
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:57,337
The troops lacked motivation, discipline, and supplies.

196
00:10:57,337 --> 00:11:01,284
Napoleon addressed this by delivering compelling speeches,

197
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:04,037
emphasizing the importance of discipline for victory

198
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:08,917
and condemning looting and pillaging in conquered territories,

199
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:11,145
asserting that only cowards engage in such actions.

200
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:14,313
Napoleon's armies didn't loot or pillage territories. 

201
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:16,802
Despite this, Napoleon did indulge in 
one form of appropriation—art.

202
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,023
That's right.

203
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:22,885
His passion for art stemmed from his 
desire to establish a universal museum in Paris,

204
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:26,290
showcasing a vast collection of 
artworks from around the world.

205
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,198
In later years, he even renamed 
the Louvre Museum,

206
00:11:30,198 --> 00:11:32,503
naming the museum after himself.

207
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:34,873
Getting back to the Army of Italy,

208
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:38,322
Napoleon led them in a famous battle against the Austrians.,

209
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,869
the Battle of Arcole.

210
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:44,160
This famous painting depicts this battle.

211
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,608
Napoleon's tactics involved

212
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:49,190
rapid troop movement, varied formations,

213
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,039
and surprise attacks on the enemy.

214
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,103
Using these, Napoleon's troops won the Battle of Arcole.

215
00:11:57,481 --> 00:12:03,096
In 1798, as France contemplated 
invading the British Isles,

216
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:05,608
Napoleon, upon his return to Paris,

217
00:12:05,608 --> 00:12:07,637
refused to fight in this battle.

218
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:11,084
He argued that the British Navy was formidable

219
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:13,005
and it made any invasion impractical.

220
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:15,161
He proposed an alternative campaign

221
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:17,772
in the Mediterranean.

222
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:20,814
Advancing southward to capture Egypt

223
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:24,064
and blocking the route of the British to India.

224
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:28,331
Afterwards, Napoleon planned to 
assist Tipu Sultan of Mysore

225
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,875
in his struggle against the British.

226
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:34,971
Commencing his Mediterranean campaign with 40,000 soldiers,

227
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:40,116
Napoleon and his soldiers set sail for 
Toulon, boarding numerous ships.

228
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:42,323
In addition to the soldiers,

229
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:46,530
he brought along over 160 
scientists, scholars, and artists,

230
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:53,895
aiming to document valuable knowledge acquired in new territories.

231
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:56,860
The army progressed southward,

232
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,786
capturing the island of Malta

233
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:03,921
before landing on the Egyptian coast in Alexandria.

234
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:07,149
Battles such as the Battle of Alexandria 
and the Battle of the Pyramids, unfolded.

235
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:09,543
"Following the footsteps of Alexander, the Great,

236
00:13:09,543 --> 00:13:10,823
and Ceaser,

237
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,151
and destined for greatness."

238
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:21,411
Resulting in victories against the Ottoman army and local kings.

239
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:25,022
The French flag flew over the Citadel of Qaitbay

240
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:28,163
Look at these photos from present-day Egypt.

241
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:30,680
Napoleon established the Institute of Egypt

242
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,339
to systematically study the country's 
history, culture, and resources,

243
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:40,477
concurrently promoting Enlightenment ideals in Egypt.

244
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:43,125
However, the success of Napoleon's plan was short-lived.

245
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,049
Within a few weeks, in August 1798,

246
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:50,694
a formidable fleet of the British Navy attacked the French,

247
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:52,806
leading to the destruction of numerous French ships

248
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:54,260
and the d3ath of a French admiral

249
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,772
in the Battle of the Nile,

250
00:13:57,772 --> 00:14:02,481
depicted in this historic painting
showing numerous destroyed French ships.

251
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:05,451
A year later, in August 1799,

252
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:07,973
following continued defeats,

253
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:13,006
Napoleon clandestinely abandoned 
his army and fled from Egypt.

254
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:16,211
Although Napoleon's military campaign was a substantial failure,

255
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:19,746
Let alone reaching India and helping Tipu Sultan,

256
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:22,546
Napoleon lost his hold on Egypt too.

257
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:25,082
And Malta, which was captured first,

258
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:27,177
was recaptured by the British.

259
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:33,553
You'd be wondering why I'm mentioning this failure.

260
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:35,083
For two reasons.

261
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:39,218
Firstly, despite its military setbacks, the campaign

262
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:42,539
was scientifically successful.

263
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:46,407
Notably, the discovery of the Rosetta Stone,

264
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:50,311
a slab inscribed with the same message in three different languages,

265
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:55,495
the key to our understanding of the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.

266
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,848
The Rosetta Stone had been previously discussed 
in the video on the Indus Valley Civilization.

267
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:02,713
For further insights into this remarkable 
artifact, you may refer to that video.

268
00:15:02,713 --> 00:15:05,824
Additionally, French scientists made significant discoveries

269
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:08,219
about the types of trees and plants indigenous to Egypt.

270
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:09,387
They explored the topography of Egypt,

271
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:11,112
studied architectural designs,

272
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:14,324
and documented the utilization 
of Egyptian jars for food preservation.

273
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:17,434
The second reason why this seemingly 
unsuccessful campaign holds importance

274
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:22,806
lies in Napoleon's reception upon returning to France.

275
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:26,106
he was welcomed as a hero,

276
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:35,347
You must be perplexed by how

277
00:15:35,347 --> 00:15:40,539
Napoleon, who lost the territories, 
and abandoned his army,

278
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,755
is welcomed as a hero?

279
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:49,020
This was due to the extensive pro-Napoleon 
propaganda that had been ongoing for years.

280
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,506
A multitude of mediums, ranging from newspapers to paintings,

281
00:15:51,506 --> 00:15:54,509
official bulletins, songs, and poems,

282
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:57,440
Napoleon was being praised throughout France.

283
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,819
There were 6 newspapers in France back then,

284
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:02,610
some of them were established by Napoleon himself,

285
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,895
while Napoleon tookover the control over the others.

286
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:08,940
These newspapers printed about various battles.

287
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,582
The narrative in the newspapers would be set by Napoleon himself.

288
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:17,258
Napoleon presented himself as a knowledgeable person.

289
00:16:17,258 --> 00:16:20,489
Several positive paintings and sketches were used

290
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:22,928
to depict his heroic battles.

291
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:26,573
When he chose the scientists for his Mediterranean campaign,

292
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:32,577
the newspapers printed seven pages 
writing about each minute of the meeting. 

293
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:36,381
Napoleon's speeches to his soldiers were widely published,

294
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:42,076
along with his childhood stories, 
both factual and fictional,

295
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:45,746
Imaginary stories of Napoleon's childhood were created,

296
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:48,177
of the great deeds he never did.

297
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:52,781
An intriguing narrative emerged around 
Napoleon's love for Josephine,

298
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:55,979
this romantic relationship has been 
portrayed in depth in this film.

299
00:16:55,979 --> 00:17:00,072
Director Ridley Scott claims that
Napoleon's conquered the world

300
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:01,804
to win over Josephine's love. 

301
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:03,627
But when he couldn't

302
00:17:03,627 --> 00:17:07,628
he conquered the world to destroy her.

303
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:10,068
Destroying himself in the process.

304
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:12,699
I won't talk about this film's plot too much in this video,

305
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,260
you can watch the movie to know more.

306
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,421
Returning to the discussion of propaganda,

307
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:18,689
let's examine these propaganda paintings.

308
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:21,489
One notable piece, commissioned by Napoleon himself,

309
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:25,199
depicts his Mediterranean campaign,

310
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,553
portraying him helping the sick in Jaffa

311
00:17:30,553 --> 00:17:33,949
and drawing parallels to Jesus Christ.

312
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:36,152
Another example is this painting

313
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:38,478
illustrating the Battle of Marengo

314
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:41,711
fought between the French and Austrian armies in 1800,

315
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:47,193
where Napoleon is depicted crossing the Alps on horseback,

316
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:51,925
you'd note that this painting is inspired by Alexander's sculpture.

317
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:54,551
But why is this a propaganda painting?

318
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:57,674
Because this isn't how Napoleon crossed the Alps.

319
00:17:57,674 --> 00:18:00,285
Look at this painting from 1850,

320
00:18:00,285 --> 00:18:02,919
this is how he crossed the Alps.

321
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:06,721
On a mule guided by a farmer.

322
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:09,521
These propaganda paintings served a specific purpose:

323
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:13,353
to show Napoleon as the hero crossing the Alps on a horse. 

324
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:16,223
The aim of the propaganda was to

325
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:18,616
advance Napoleon's ultimate goal

326
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:21,251
his final ambition.

327
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:22,497
To be on the throne.

328
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:30,195
When Napoleon returned to France from Egypt,

329
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:34,304
there was widespread conflict and corruption reports in France.

330
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:37,803
Napoleon orchestrated a coup in November 1799.

331
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:40,139
This led to the expulsion of the existing government

332
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:42,748
and the establishment of a new Consulate government,

333
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:45,577
with Napoleon as the First Consul of the new government.

334
00:18:45,577 --> 00:18:48,973
Two individuals were appointed as aiding consuls,

335
00:18:48,973 --> 00:18:51,504
and a new constitution was introduced in France.

336
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:54,098
Most French citizens didn't disapprove of it

337
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,406
due to the widespread influence of propaganda,

338
00:18:56,406 --> 00:19:01,609
portraying Napoleon as a figure transcending politics,

339
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:04,453
acting solely in the French national interest,

340
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:08,736
and championing Enlightenment ideas.

341
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:12,130
To solidify public approval on the new Constitution, 

342
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,529
a referendum was held in France,

343
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:20,035
and the results, announced by Napoleon's brother 
Lucien, the Minister of Interiors in France

344
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:27,054
that 99.9% of the 3,013,000 voters

345
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:29,346
supported the new constitution.

346
00:19:29,346 --> 00:19:34,386
It shows that 99.9% of the French citizens favoured Napoleon. 

347
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,276
Was that true?
Absolutely not.

348
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:40,216
In reality, approximately 1.5 million votes 
were cast in favour of Napoleon.

349
00:19:40,216 --> 00:19:45,552
French historian Claude Langlois presented evidence in 1972,

350
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:49,736
revealing that the 1800 referendum was a complete fraud,

351
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:54,059
with slightly over 50% of the votes cast
were in favour of Napoleon.

352
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:58,339
Two years later, another referendum took place in 1802,

353
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,755
where Napoleon posed the question to the public:

354
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:04,297
Should he be appointed Consul for Life?

355
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:07,204
Once again, the public voted

356
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:10,926
with "99.7% voters"

357
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:14,071
supporting Napoleon to hold power for life.

358
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:17,154
Even after two fraud referendums,
Napoleon sought further validation. 

359
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:20,615
In 1804, a third referendum was conducted,

360
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:25,922
asking if Napoleon should become the King of France.

361
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:27,933
And the result of the referendum was that,

362
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:31,239
"99.9% of the voters"

363
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:34,839
voted in favour of Napoleon becoming the king.

364
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:39,262
Napoleon wasn't greedy for the power,

365
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:42,261
but became the King to appease the masses.

366
00:20:42,261 --> 00:20:45,141
I'm kidding, that's not how it went.

367
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:50,128
Napoleon wasn't one to hide his greed for power.

368
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:53,185
He openly embraced his love for power,

369
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,186
famously declaring, 'Power is my mistress.

370
00:20:56,186 --> 00:20:58,795
I have worked too hard at her conquest

371
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:01,897
to allow anyone to take her away from me.'

372
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:10,369
Back then, this hunger for power,

373
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:14,729
was a characteristic accepted among 
kings and nobles of the time.

374
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:18,122
Over the next decade, driven by Napoleon's love for power

375
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:21,791
he engaged in a series of battles across Europe,

376
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,269
interspersed with peace treaties,

377
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:27,775
such as the one signed with Britain in 1802.

378
00:21:27,775 --> 00:21:30,127
However, the resumption of wars was inevitable

379
00:21:30,127 --> 00:21:32,172
as both Napoleon and the British thirsted for power.

380
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:35,772
Many European nations engaged in wars with Napoleon 

381
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:39,910
not only for power but also for their survival.

382
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,465
Many European kings and monarchs felt 
threatened by the French revolutionary ideology.

383
00:21:44,465 --> 00:21:47,974
They considered Napolean a threat to their kingdom.

384
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,304
In the French Revolution video, I explained that

385
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:55,293
the ideology of Nationalism was introduced by the Enlightenment thinkers.

386
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:57,157
Such as Rousseau and Voltaire.

387
00:21:57,157 --> 00:21:59,952
These were the ideologies of left-wing revolutionaries.

388
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:06,594
While the right-wing adhered to 
supporting monarchies and social hierarchy,

389
00:22:06,594 --> 00:22:09,929
preserving the existing system.

390
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,592
The left-wing ideology championed equality,

391
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:17,144
freedom, and the aspiration for national freedom,

392
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:20,865
evolving into the foundation of Republicanism.

393
00:22:20,865 --> 00:22:22,521
This nationalist fervour

394
00:22:22,521 --> 00:22:25,350
was quickly spreading across other 
European nations during that period,

395
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,683
leading to the emergence of revolutionaries

396
00:22:27,683 --> 00:22:30,276
challenging the reigning monarchies.

397
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:34,178
In response, these monarchs formed coalitions,

398
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:38,642
sparking a series of coalition wars 
between 1792 and 1815,

399
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:40,857
where monarchies collectively waged war against France.

400
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:44,080
In this context, Napoleon's role can be seen as

401
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,480
that of a liberator,

402
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,724
propagating the slogans of freedom 
and revolution throughout Europe.

403
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:52,952
When Napoleon's forces entered Italy, he declared

404
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:54,611
to the Italian people that the French army

405
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:56,419
had come to break their chains.

406
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:58,643
He told them that he bore no ill will against the masses,

407
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:02,168
rather they were there to liberate them 
from kings and emperors

408
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:04,557
who had oppressed them.

409
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:09,202
This is why in Milan, Italy 
Napoleon was viewed as a hero.

410
00:23:09,202 --> 00:23:13,480
For liberating them from Austrian rule under King Francis II.

411
00:23:13,804 --> 00:23:16,648
Italian revolutionary and poet Yugo Foscolo

412
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:19,092
in 1802, said this about him:

413
00:23:19,092 --> 00:23:21,570
"I will name you, therefore, Bonaparte,

414
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,161
with the unheard-of title of Liberator 
of Peoples and Founder of Republics."

415
00:23:26,161 --> 00:23:29,599
Additionally, in 1803, on of the 
most renowned music composer,

416
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,632
Beethoven paid tribute to Napoleon by 
naming his Symphony No. 3 after him.

417
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,897
He named the Symphony No. 3

418
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:38,353
Bonaparte.

419
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:40,941
Beethoven considered Napoleon a hero

420
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:44,985
for promoting democratic ideology 
and opposing monarchy in Europe.

421
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:47,484
However, how could he be a hero when

422
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:50,707
he crowned himself the king

423
00:23:50,707 --> 00:23:53,233
and conducted fraudulent referendums?

424
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:57,566
When Beethoven learned of Napoleon declaring himself a king,

425
00:24:00,268 --> 00:24:02,077
he angrily proclaimed that

426
00:24:02,077 --> 00:24:05,407
Napoleon was just a man, not a deity,

427
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:09,510
susceptible to the lure of power 
and capable of oppressing people.

428
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,613
Beethoven subsequently removed 
Napoleon's name from his symphony.

429
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:19,052
Indeed, Napoleon's decisions deviated from 
the principles of the French Revolution.

430
00:24:19,052 --> 00:24:22,871
In 1802, he enacted two laws that

431
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:25,847
reinstated practices of slavery.

432
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:28,167
Furthermore, his views on women were regressive,

433
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:32,402
emphasizing the importance of women 
based on the number of children she bore.

434
00:24:32,402 --> 00:24:35,012
Napoleon revoked many rights granted to women

435
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:36,833
during the French Revolution,

436
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:40,590
reinstating priority given to men in divorce laws.

437
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:46,016
Although the French Revolution had 
championed freedom of expression,

438
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:49,768
Napoleon gradually imposed restrictions on it.

439
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:53,319
Dissenters who spoke against him were exiled,

440
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:57,131
and free newspapers were systematically shut down.

441
00:24:57,131 --> 00:24:59,790
Despite bringing stability to France,

442
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,610
Napoleon's rule maintained a dictatorial character.

443
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:07,258
If he genuinely aimed to propagate 
the ideas of the French Revolution,

444
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:10,794
he could have reinstated democracy in France.

445
00:25:10,794 --> 00:25:13,866
I began this video, by talking about Corsica.

446
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:17,780
How Corsican independence was Napoleon's childhood dream.

447
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,728
Yet as a king, he never pursued the liberation of Corsica.

448
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:25,142
Instead of bringing democracy to France,

449
00:25:25,142 --> 00:25:30,897
Napoleon appointed his brothers as 
kings in the conquered territories.

450
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:32,701
In May 1808,

451
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:35,474
France initiated a war against Spain,

452
00:25:35,474 --> 00:25:38,841
resulting in the Spanish King Carlos IV stepping down,

453
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:43,364
and Napoleon installing his brother Joseph as the new ruler.

454
00:25:43,364 --> 00:25:46,356
Before this, Joseph had been 
the king of Naples and Sicily.

455
00:25:46,356 --> 00:25:49,981
Napoleon's younger brother Jerome 
was crowned the king of Westphalia,

456
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,639
a region in present-day Germany.

457
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:57,177
Additionally, when the Kingdom of Holland 
fell under Napoleon's control in 1806,

458
00:25:57,177 --> 00:26:01,196
Louis, another of Napoleon's brothers, 
was made the king of that region.

459
00:26:01,196 --> 00:26:03,219
However, amidst this hunger for power,

460
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:06,378
there is a positive legacy 
left by Napoleon worth noting.

461
00:26:06,378 --> 00:26:11,836
Several decisions he made had far-reaching 
benefits for the future of France and Europe.

462
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,464
The Napoleonic Code of 1804

463
00:26:14,464 --> 00:26:17,618
stands out as a landmark legal framework, providing France 

464
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,338
with a comprehensive and written set of laws.

465
00:26:20,338 --> 00:26:22,720
The second achievement was the establishment 
of equality for males under the law,

466
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,774
despite the setbacks for women's rights

467
00:26:24,774 --> 00:26:26,929
and the reintroduction of slavery.

468
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:31,181
The equal rights given to the male citizens by the law,

469
00:26:31,181 --> 00:26:32,365
remained unchanged.

470
00:26:32,365 --> 00:26:36,208
Furthermore, Napoleon's era marked 
the end of feudalism in France,

471
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,886
In the territories he occupied,

472
00:26:38,886 --> 00:26:41,441
the same laws were enforced.

473
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:43,374
Third, Secularism.

474
00:26:43,374 --> 00:26:45,952
During Napoleon's rule, the French 
government adopted a secular stance. 

475
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:47,788
There was religious freedom in France,

476
00:26:47,788 --> 00:26:51,355
allowing individuals to practice their chosen religions.

477
00:26:51,355 --> 00:26:55,215
In 1801, Christianity did return to France

478
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:58,057
when Napoleon signed an agreement with the Pope.

479
00:26:58,057 --> 00:27:01,191
But the relationship between the Church and the Government

480
00:27:01,191 --> 00:27:02,719
never fully went back to the way it used to be.

481
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:06,628
The power balance shifted more favourably towards the government.

482
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:11,905
While traditional positions of the 
Catholic clergy in the Church were restored,

483
00:27:11,905 --> 00:27:16,826
the government retained control over the selection of bishops

484
00:27:16,826 --> 00:27:21,529
and supervised the church's finances,

485
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:25,802
significantly diminishing the influence 
of the church in European affairs.

486
00:27:25,802 --> 00:27:28,947
Fourth, establishing a banking system.

487
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:33,111
The Bank of France was founded by Napoleon in 1800,

488
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:36,595
It brought hyperinflation under control

489
00:27:36,595 --> 00:27:38,481
and stabilized the currency.

490
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:42,304
Fifth, he introduced a modern and efficient tax system,

491
00:27:42,304 --> 00:27:46,266
ending the exemptions previously granted to nobility and kings,

492
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:51,680
ensuring that everyone contributed to the tax base.

493
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,814
Sixth, in the education system,

494
00:27:53,814 --> 00:27:55,560
Napoleon set up primary, secondary, and high schools,

495
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,332
along with establishing the University of France.

496
00:27:58,332 --> 00:28:00,632
Uniformity was introduced to the education system,

497
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:02,306
teachers were trained,

498
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:05,127
and a centralized recruitment process
for teachers was initiated.

499
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:10,294
The government also regulated technical schools, 
civil service schools, and military schools,

500
00:28:10,294 --> 00:28:13,003
leading to a rapid improvement 
in the overall quality of education.

501
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:14,873
Seventh, water distribution.

502
00:28:14,873 --> 00:28:19,202
In 1808, Napoleon modernized Paris's water 
distribution system by upgrading old pumps,

503
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:21,155
constructing a new canal

504
00:28:21,155 --> 00:28:22,990
to direct water to the city,

505
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,621
and building 15 water fountains.

506
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:29,190
He ensured that Parisians would never starve.

507
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,665
Storehouses and granaries were modernized,

508
00:28:32,665 --> 00:28:34,542
and eight new markets were constructed

509
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:36,132
wine market, wheat market,

510
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,289
everything happened in an organised manner.

511
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:42,298
In conclusion, despite Napoleon's hunger for power,

512
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:44,438
he wasn't a clueless ruler.

513
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:48,496
Napoleon emerged as a highly intelligent and effective administrator,

514
00:28:48,496 --> 00:28:51,265
implementing several positive reforms for the French people.

515
00:28:51,265 --> 00:28:53,757
Some people draw comparisons 
between Napoleon and Hitler

516
00:28:53,757 --> 00:28:56,024
which, in my opinion, are entirely inaccurate,

517
00:28:56,024 --> 00:29:01,242
as Napoleon did not propagate hatred 
against any religion or community,

518
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:04,927
nor did he employ strategies of divide and rule.

519
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:08,313
While Napoleon's actions resulted in the d3aths of millions,

520
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,746
but he was driven by his thirst for war and power.

521
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:15,562
Finally, let's talk about how Napoleon d!ed.

522
00:29:15,562 --> 00:29:18,676
Despite his numerous victories, 
he also faced defeats.

523
00:29:18,676 --> 00:29:21,507
Such as Napoleon's Egyptian campaign, as discussed earlier,

524
00:29:21,507 --> 00:29:24,333
Napoleon had installed a Continental System,

525
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:27,461
a comprehensive economic blockade against Britain

526
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:29,336
by all French allied countries.

527
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:33,038
When Russia violated this continental system in 1812,

528
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,455
Napoleon launched an attack on Russia.

529
00:29:35,455 --> 00:29:37,876
The Russian forces refused to fight.

530
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:41,495
They would retreat and set fire to the battlefield,

531
00:29:41,495 --> 00:29:45,848
leaving nothing for Napoleon's troops as provisions.

532
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:48,995
Even so, Napoleon's army reached Moscow,

533
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,342
but the city was empty,

534
00:29:51,342 --> 00:29:54,623
and after a month of waiting for the Russians to surrender,

535
00:29:54,623 --> 00:29:56,023
to no avail,

536
00:29:56,023 --> 00:30:02,836
Napoleon's hungry army had to retreat from the barren city.

537
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:04,689
The next year in 1813,

538
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:07,859
a coalition comprising the United Kingdom, 
Russia, Prussia, Austria, Sweden,

539
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:11,927
and other countries collectively attacked Napoleon

540
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:14,650
in the Battle of Leipzig,

541
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,882
dealing a significant blow to France.

542
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:22,745
This led to Napoleon's exile 
to the island of Elba in 1814.

543
00:30:22,745 --> 00:30:26,217
However, in 1815, he made a dramatic comeback,

544
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:32,233
rallying his soldiers and marching towards Paris.

545
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:36,544
Despite briefly reclaiming the throne with public support,

546
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,394
his rule lasted only three months.

547
00:30:39,394 --> 00:30:41,523
The United Kingdom and its allies

548
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:45,018
waged another war against Napoleon,

549
00:30:45,018 --> 00:30:49,329
culminating in the Battle of Waterloo, 
the final battle of Napoleon.

550
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:54,938
Following this defeat, Napoleon was 
exiled to the remote island of St Helena,

551
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:58,621
where he passed away six years later

552
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:00,408
in 1821,

553
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:04,317
marking the end of Napoleon's remarkable story.

554
00:31:04,317 --> 00:31:06,154
