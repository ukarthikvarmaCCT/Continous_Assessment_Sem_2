1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
all right so this is an iPhone 14 plus

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,300
pretty big phone but how big do you

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,759
think the biggest iPhone in the world is

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,099
so I wasn't expecting this but YouTuber

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,660
Matthew beam told me he was building the

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,160
world's biggest iPhone a few days ago

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,960
and then he showed up with it this thing

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,780
is fully functional seven feet tall and

9
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,820
weighs close to 500 pounds it has a

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,140
power button here there's also volume

11
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,180
buttons and a mute switch it's so tall

12
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,859
you have to get up on a ladder to take a

13
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,300
selfie with the camera because it's all

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,039
the way up here but you know I am the

15
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,359
tech YouTuber so I kind of had to

16
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,920
investigate a little bit into how he

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,660
made this and first of all watch his

18
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,099
video for my full reaction on the thing

19
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,660
but turns out there is no iPhone

20
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,540
actually in here at all it's actually a

21
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,640
Mac Mini in here which simulates running

22
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,399
a virtual Android phone and then that

23
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,440
Android phone is running a launcher that

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,660
makes it look like an iPhone all with

25
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,340
some jail rig Tech on the edges to make

26
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,140
it see where your finger is to make it

27
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,300
act like a touch screen all that to say

28
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,100
it's not an iPhone technically but it is

29
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,480
still pretty impressive
