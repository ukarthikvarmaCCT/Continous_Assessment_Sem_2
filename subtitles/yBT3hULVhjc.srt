1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:00,888
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,888 --> 00:00:02,688
About 60 or 70 years ago,

3
00:00:02,688 --> 00:00:04,080
when people were asked

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,122
to imagine how the year 2020 would look,

5
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:10,694
people imagined futuristic looking cities.

6
00:00:10,694 --> 00:00:12,789
Hoverboards.

7
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:14,728
Cars flying in the sky.

8
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:17,983
Flying cars would have become a reality.

9
00:00:17,983 --> 00:00:20,272
But unfortunately, it didn't happen.

10
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:22,673
The reality looks like this today.

11
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:26,174
While people imagine the year 2020 to look like this.

12
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:27,797
But do you know what, friends?

13
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:29,829
Flying cars are something

14
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,629
that's slowly becoming a reality.

15
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:33,831
Today, in 2022,

16
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:36,162
a company in Slovakia,

17
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:40,062
has successfully tested an actual flying car.

18
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:42,037
This isn't a dream for the future,

19
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:43,831
it is the reality now.

20
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:46,830
Come, let's understand this technology
in today's video.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,457
"If you haven't noticed lately,

22
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:51,227
we're living in the future.

23
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:53,819
But there's still one thing that's conspicuously absent.

24
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:54,942
"Where are the flying cars?"

25
00:00:54,942 --> 00:00:57,057
"I was promised flying cars."

26
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,856
"I don't see any flying cars."

27
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:00,632
"Why?"

28
00:01:00,632 --> 00:01:01,899
Would there ever be an aircraft

29
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:02,980
where you can just jump in,

30
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,664
and be able to take off
and fly where ever you want to?"

31
00:01:05,664 --> 00:01:07,236
Listening to it, friends, it feels like

32
00:01:07,236 --> 00:01:09,469
a flying car is something really futuristic.

33
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:14,965
but people had started trying to make one about 100 years ago.

34
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,002
The year 1917,

35
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:20,490
saw the first attempt at building a flying car. 

36
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,200
Or perhaps a roadable aeroplane.

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,857
An aeroplane that can navigate roads too.

38
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:28,130
It was named the Autoplane.

39
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,721
This was built by Glenn Curtis.

40
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:34,787
It was given the title
'Limousine of the Year.'

41
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:37,133
But was this flying car actually able to fly?

42
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:39,491
It's said that when they tried to fly it

43
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:41,487
it lifted off the ground

44
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:44,567
but unfortunately, it couldn't fly properly. 

45
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:47,012
So the Autoplane turned out to be a failure.

46
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:49,177
After this, we get to 1933,

47
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:52,130
when the US Air Commerce Bureau conducted a competition,

48
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,733
called the Flivver Competition.

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,350
They challenged people to design an aeroplane

50
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,898
that would cost less than $700 to build.

51
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:03,130
Many models were submitted in this competition,

52
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,501
and one of these models was of
the Aerobile.

53
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,922
Designed by Walda Waterman.

54
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,294
This was an aeroplane that looked like a car.

55
00:02:10,294 --> 00:02:12,234
It could take flight

56
00:02:12,234 --> 00:02:14,175
but never went into production,

57
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,104
because they were going through the Great Depression.

58
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:19,929
There were enough funds to produce it.

59
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:22,852
But what could be called the first successful attempt

60
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:24,612
took place in 1945.

61
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:27,650
American inventor Robert Edison Fulton,

62
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,068
built an aeroplane called the Airphibian.

63
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:32,760
It looked like a proper aeroplane,

64
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,474
the only difference was that the front of it could be detached.

65
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:39,177
It took about 5 minutes to convert this aeroplane into a car.

66
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:43,414
And the resulting car looked like the front of the aeroplane.

67
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:46,659
For its era, this Airphibian was quite innovative

68
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:50,408
and it got a flight certification from the Civil Aviation Authority.

69
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:51,695
But the problem was that,

70
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:53,530
because of the compromises in the design,

71
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,854
it was neither a good aeroplane,

72
00:02:55,854 --> 00:02:59,238
that could compete with the other aeroplanes.

73
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:01,283
Nor was it a good car,

74
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:03,426
that could compete with the other cars.

75
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:05,839
When it turned into a car, it looked really weird.

76
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:09,745
To add to it, in 1945, there were financial problems due to World War II.

77
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:13,133
This company could not find investors for this flying car.

78
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,380
And then came the Convaircar.

79
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,534
Industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss
attempted this in 1947.

80
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:24,310
This looked like a car stuck with an aeroplane on it.

81
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,893
Airphibian looked like an aeroplane completely.

82
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:28,244
But this looked as if

83
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:31,090
the car got stuck to the aeroplane by mistake

84
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,152
and is now flying with it.

85
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:35,548
It too took 5 minutes to convert from an aeroplane to a car.

86
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,792
And by converting, it meant

87
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:41,441
detaching the aeroplane part and keeping it aside.

88
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,552
And then it could be used as a car.

89
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:45,690
It was a great idea for its time.

90
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,463
And in its third test flight,

91
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:49,405
this Convaircar crashed.

92
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:51,072
The pilot checked the reading on the meter,

93
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:53,395
and thought that there was enough fuel
and that he could continue flying,

94
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:55,049
and though the car did have enough fuel,

95
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,530
there was very little in the aeroplane's tank.

96
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,555
It led to this unfortunate crash.

97
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:01,948
After this crash, people lost confidence in it.

98
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:03,603
And the investors backed out.

99
00:04:03,603 --> 00:04:05,179
The problem with these attempts was that

100
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,904
they took a car, and they took an aeroplane,

101
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:10,284
and they tried to combine them as they were.

102
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:12,597
A true flying car would be one

103
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:15,909
that could actually transform from an aeroplane to a car.

104
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,994
The two can't simply be combined

105
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:21,640
merely to detach the part of the aeroplane when the car is used.

106
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,676
Morton Taylor was the first person

107
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:27,399
to decide to work on the design of Airphibian,

108
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,522
and to make the wings of the Airphibian foldable.

109
00:04:30,522 --> 00:04:32,331
So that when it has to be used as a car,

110
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:34,087
the wings can be folded

111
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:36,477
and stored behind the car.

112
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:38,868
This came true in the year 1949.

113
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,736
It was named Taylor's Aerocar.

114
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:42,264
They got the certification,

115
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:44,238
the approval for mass production,

116
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:45,632
but the problem was that

117
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:48,970
they needed at least 500 advance orders

118
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,690
before mass production could begin.

119
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,630
But there weren't enough people interested in it.

120
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,016
So they couldn't get the orders.

121
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:57,670
So the deal had to be cancelled.

122
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,171
At one point, the company Ford was quite close

123
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:02,045
to buying this Taylor Aerocar.

124
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:04,613
But that deal couldn't be finalised either.

125
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:06,936
There was a scarcity of funds

126
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:09,317
but perhaps a bigger problem was

127
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:11,059
the lack of technological advancement.

128
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:13,070
We didn't have the technology

129
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,860
to build a true flying car.

130
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,204
But today,

131
00:05:17,204 --> 00:05:18,616
neither do we lack funds,

132
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:22,881
and the technology has moved by leaps and bounds since the 1950s.

133
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,379
So the recent attempts at building a flying car,

134
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,694
have been amazing.

135
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,761
They are truly futuristic.

136
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:31,252
In October 2021,

137
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:33,869
a Swedish company called Jetson Aero,

138
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:37,308
presented their Jetson 1 Airplane to the world.

139
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:46,219
As you can see,

140
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:48,086
it doesn't look like a car at all,

141
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:51,086
rather it can be called an extra-large drone.

142
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:53,298
Because it flies just like a drone.

143
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:57,827
A person sits inside it and pilots it around.

144
00:05:57,827 --> 00:05:59,675
It is a single-seater vehicle.

145
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:01,418
Only one person can sit inside it.

146
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:04,750
They had started working on it in 2017.

147
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,766
The first prototype was ready in January 2018

148
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,778
and it had its first successful flight too.

149
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:12,901
But they introduced their company

150
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:16,418
and presented their 2nd generation prototype to the world.

151
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,082
In October 2021.

152
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:19,898
Its speciality is its design.

153
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:22,752
A helicopter needs a helipad to take off

154
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:24,555
but this is so compact,

155
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:27,565
so small that it can land on your roof

156
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:30,304
and take off from your neighbourhood garden as well.

157
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:31,916
To keep it lightweight,

158
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,059
its frame is made of aluminium.

159
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:37,074
And it weighs only 86kg.

160
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:38,408
It is very light.

161
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:39,796
And the person sitting in it,

162
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:41,443
can weigh up to 95kg.

163
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,207
Perhaps the most interesting thing is that

164
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:46,280
you wouldn't need a pilot's license to fly it.

165
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,058
Because according to the US Laws,

166
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:50,323
there is no need for a pilot's license,

167
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:52,863
for a home-built, single-seater aircraft.

168
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:55,298
Since it is a single-seater aircraft,

169
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,801
only one person can sit in it,

170
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:58,150
and it's home-built too

171
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,796
because if you buy it,

172
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:02,312
it'll reach you 50% assembled.

173
00:07:02,312 --> 00:07:04,132
You can order it from anywhere in the world,

174
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,741
the way that the company ships this to you,

175
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:10,084
you need to assemble it yourself.

176
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:12,460
So it comes under the category home-built.

177
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,787
With this, the legal hassles for the company reduce.

178
00:07:14,787 --> 00:07:17,775
Because the company would no longer be responsible in case of accidents.

179
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:19,427
Because you have put it together.

180
00:07:19,427 --> 00:07:22,402
Jetson 1 is truly very futuristic,

181
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:25,230
but it cannot be practically used much.

182
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,791
Because you can't fly it at night.

183
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,495
You can't fly it over city traffic.

184
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:30,241
Because these are restricted airspace.

185
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,537
And generally,

186
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:34,507
it is quite difficult to fly a camera drone nowadays,

187
00:07:34,507 --> 00:07:37,519
it will be very difficult to get permission to fly this.

188
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,917
But their co-founder, Peter Ternstrom, has said that

189
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:43,833
they aren't trying to solve a problem in the world

190
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,760
they are simply promoting it as a fun activity.

191
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,684
He claims that it is fun to fly it.

192
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:52,578
You can guess the origins of the name of the company, Jetson.

193
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:55,820
If you recall, The Jetsons used to be a cartoon show a while ago.

194
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:02,044
And the futuristic aircraft used by the Jetsons to travel

195
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:04,829
looked somewhat like this.

196
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:07,157
So they tried to copy that design

197
00:08:07,157 --> 00:08:09,243
and took inspiration from it.

198
00:08:09,243 --> 00:08:12,653
So this Jetson 1 cannot be termed as a proper flying car.

199
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:14,338
Because it can run on the roads.

200
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:16,460
But there's another company in Slovakia.

201
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,769
They presented their Aircar to the world last month.

202
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:23,400
It is a flying car in true essence.

203
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,995
Friends, it is very clear

204
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:26,497
that to build such technology,

205
00:08:26,497 --> 00:08:30,585
we need skilful engineers and out of the world innovation. 

206
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:33,552
Unfortunately, innovative things of this level

207
00:08:33,552 --> 00:08:36,312
can be rarely seen in countries like India.

208
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:38,018
A huge reason for this is that

209
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,159
there are many engineers with degrees in India

210
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,115
but they lack the skills that are actually needed to do a job properly.

211
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:46,787
More than 90% of the engineers in India

212
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:48,558
aren't employable due to this.

213
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:50,597
Thankfully, there are some companies

214
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,760
that are helping software engineers to become more skilled.

215
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,400
Like Scaler.com

216
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,285
Scaler.com is a tech school

217
00:08:57,285 --> 00:09:01,602
where the subject matter experts from the top tech companies teach students.

218
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:04,521
They share their industry experience with the learners.

219
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:07,453
They focus on college students and working professionals

220
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:09,399
so that they can be upskilled.

221
00:09:09,657 --> 00:09:12,515
Especially with their one-on-one mentorship programs.

222
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:15,003
They focus on making them more skilful.

223
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:17,738
They claim that in 2020-2021,

224
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:21,806
more Scaled learners got placement in Amazon

225
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:24,664
compared to all the IITs combined.

226
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,790
They provide the learners with every tool

227
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,922
with which they can become more skilled

228
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:30,526
and can further their careers.

229
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:31,760
If you are interested,

230
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,603
you can check out scaler.com through the link given in the description below.

231
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:38,634
I'd recommend their Software Development Course

232
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:39,977
and the Data Science course.

233
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:42,308
They would help you achieve the right fundamentals

234
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,640
and you would get basic problem-solving skills.

235
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,028
Let's return to the topic.

236
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:47,492
So what's special about the AirCar?

237
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,709
It completed its first intercity flight in June last year.

238
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:55,022
From the international airport Nitra
to the Bratislava airport.

239
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:56,810
Both cities are in Slovakia.

240
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,002
And Slovakia is an Eastern European country.

241
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:01,871
Last month, the Transport Authority of Slovakia,

242
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:05,389
gave it clearance for take-off.

243
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:07,864
It received the Certificate of Airworthiness.

244
00:10:07,864 --> 00:10:10,005
The European Aviation Safety Agency's

245
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:14,074
all testing safety standards are obeyed by this flying car.

246
00:10:14,074 --> 00:10:18,543
This is the first flying car to actually look like a flying car.

247
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:21,275
They used a BMW car as a base

248
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:23,008
and have attached wings to it.

249
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:25,459
The attempts of 60-70 years ago

250
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,868
was when they tried to stick a part of the aeroplane to a car.

251
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,885
But this is the first attempt

252
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:32,711
where the wings come out of the car.

253
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:35,807
No special fuel is needed to fly it.

254
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:38,428
The petrol that you get at the petrol station

255
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:40,077
is enough to fly this car.

256
00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:43,175
Because a 1.6l BMW engine is fitted inside it.

257
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,989
While flying, this AirCar can reach a height of 8,000 feet.

258
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:50,405
And it can fly at the speed of 190 km/hr.

259
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:52,710
And a maximum of 2 people can sit in the car.

260
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,052
And to transform from an aeroplane to a car,

261
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:57,699
it takes only 3 minutes.

262
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,095
This is the way it transforms.

263
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:02,883
The wings can be folded to the back.

264
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:04,626
And everything's automatic.

265
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:08,214
There's no need to unscrew anything or to separate anything.

266
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:09,592
It is all in one piece.

267
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:12,999
You can see the wings going into the back of the car slowly

268
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,565
and it is transforming into a compact car.

269
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,967
On the road, this AirCar would look like this.

270
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:22,503
It looks like a normal car on the road almost.

271
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:24,167
But it is a little overboard at the back.

272
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,533
It isn't bad.

273
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:27,840
Because some cars are long at the back.

274
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,888
One thing's certain

275
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,178
to fly this, you would need a pilot's license.

276
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:33,975
because it needs a proper runway to take off.

277
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:37,313
This AirCar has completed more than 200 takeoffs and landings

278
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:40,564
so there's no doubt that it is a successful flying car.

279
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:41,905
If you want to buy it,

280
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:43,226
how much would you need to pay?

281
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:47,833
It's said that its price will start from $500,000 ranging to $1 million,

282
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,274
depending upon the model you want to buy.

283
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:52,593
And within 12 months,

284
00:11:52,593 --> 00:11:54,688
it will become commercially available.

285
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:57,044
Meaning, you can buy it in the market then.

286
00:11:57,044 --> 00:11:58,683
The founder of Jetson 1 had said that

287
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:01,592
they see their aircraft as a means to have fun.

288
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:04,675
It's supposed to be used by people as a fun activity. 

289
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:07,427
But the company that has made the AirCar,

290
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,711
Klein Vision,

291
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:10,999
they believe that this AirCar,

292
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:13,433
will replace helicopters in the future.

293
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:17,010
Because the internal combustion engine of a normal car is used in it,

294
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,545
it would mean that it's very energy efficient.

295
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:22,249
Normally, to fly helicopters and aeroplanes,

296
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:24,154
a lot of fuel is used.

297
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:26,006
They need special fuel.

298
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:29,499
But since this AirCar can fly with a car's engine,

299
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,408
it would mean that in the future,

300
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:35,378
it wouldn't be very difficult to use the engine of an electric car

301
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:37,341
to fly this AirCar.

302
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,508
It means that,

303
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,103
a fully electric AirCar can be possible.

304
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:43,028
It will be good for the environment

305
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,388
in comparison to helicopters and normal airplanes.

306
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:47,400
The most important question to arise here is;

307
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,711
What's the need for this?

308
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:51,123
Can there be a practical use for these flying cars?

309
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:54,347
The most important use for these flying cars is said to be

310
00:12:54,347 --> 00:12:55,943
for emergency services.

311
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,348
Such as for ambulances, fire engines or for the police.

312
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:03,244
One advantage would be that it would be easier to use than helicopters.

313
00:13:03,502 --> 00:13:06,266
And there's no need to build separate infrastructure for them.

314
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,017
Railway tracks need to be laid for trains,

315
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:10,944
tunnels have to be dug for metros,

316
00:13:10,944 --> 00:13:12,980
roads need to be built for cars,

317
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,248
but for the flying cars, the same infrastructure can be used

318
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:18,112
that already exist.

319
00:13:18,112 --> 00:13:19,787
Another major advantage of these is that

320
00:13:19,787 --> 00:13:21,122
these are very flexible.

321
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:23,200
Talking about Jetson 1 aircraft,

322
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,682
they can land and take off from anywhere.

323
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:29,258
We will get end-to-end connectivity here.

324
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:31,391
And obviously the environmental impact,

325
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:33,690
can be reduced drastically

326
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:37,226
because normally, cars take a long time to cover long distances

327
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:39,303
but flying cars would be able to do it faster. 

328
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:41,560
And they'll consume less energy as well.

329
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,801
But if you talk about their disadvantages,

330
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,971
perhaps they have more disadvantages than advantages.

331
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:48,466
The first is that

332
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:51,124
Do we really need flying cars?

333
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:53,192
Let's compare it with the cars.

334
00:13:53,192 --> 00:13:56,173
Nowadays, cars have become very common,

335
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:58,422
in almost every city of every country in the world.

336
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:02,052
Everyone needs to take a driving test to get a driver's license.

337
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:03,715
But despite that,

338
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:06,952
many people drive irresponsibly,

339
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:08,191
there are accidents,

340
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:11,630
so many people die in traffic accidents around the world.

341
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,799
If people can't learn to drive properly on the road,

342
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,728
will they be able to learn to fly properly?

343
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:19,339
It'll be 10 times more difficult.

344
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:22,427
It'll have 10 times more scope of causing accidents.

345
00:14:22,427 --> 00:14:24,528
And if an accident does occur mid-air,

346
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:27,147
it would be that much more deadly.

347
00:14:27,147 --> 00:14:28,999
This is a very serious issue

348
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:32,964
how many people would need to get sufficient pilot training

349
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:34,213
to fly these?

350
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:35,876
A solution to this problem can be

351
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,881
automated flying cars.

352
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:41,537
That the flying cars fly automatically with interference from the pilot.

353
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:43,705
Like the automated cars nowadays,

354
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:45,604
Tesla already has these features

355
00:14:45,604 --> 00:14:47,480
where the car can drive itself.

356
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,799
If such self-driving flying cars are made,

357
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,795
only then can this problem be avoided.

358
00:14:51,795 --> 00:14:53,341
But talking about Tesla,

359
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:56,230
Elon Musk believes flying cars to be a bad idea.

360
00:14:56,574 --> 00:14:57,905
Because according to him,

361
00:14:57,905 --> 00:15:01,598
when there will be thousands of cars flying in the sky,

362
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:03,977
somewhere or other there'll be an accident

363
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:06,199
and if one of those cars fell on someone's head,

364
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:08,232
that person will die instantly.

365
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:11,042
The risk of people losing their lives in these accidents is very high.

366
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:13,450
And normally, when your car breaks down,

367
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,868
you park it at the side of the road to check it.

368
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:20,016
But if your car breaks down in the sky, where would you park it?

369
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:22,512
These problems would increase in bad weather.

370
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:25,682
Imagine that you are flying your car,

371
00:15:25,682 --> 00:15:27,297
and it is very windy,

372
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:29,807
or there's a thunderstorm,

373
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:31,599
suppose there's a lot of turbulence.

374
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:35,167
Normally, since the aeroplanes are much larger

375
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,700
they can bear it.

376
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,524
But in smaller private jets,

377
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:41,853
there's an increased threat from turbulence and bad weather.

378
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:44,150
And since the flying cars wouldn't be very big,

379
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,931
they'll face the same threats.

380
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:47,998
After this, there's also the problem of safety.

381
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:52,294
It's true that no new infrastructure is needed for a couple of flying cars,

382
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:54,725
but if thousands of cars fly in the sky,

383
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:59,655
a new system of traffic lights will need to be put up.

384
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:01,137
Such as the ones for cars.

385
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:04,756
Since the cars will be flying in all directions, there's a dire need for traffic lights.

386
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,077
Newt technical standards would need to be enforced,

387
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:11,359
so that the flying cars could communicate with each other

388
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:14,655
so that there aren't collisions and crashes.

389
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:16,145
But it wouldn't be easy to do this.

390
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:21,049
Because today, it is so difficult for governments to make regulations for drones.

391
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:23,737
That the governments take to banning drones.

392
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:26,780
And these drones merely fly to take aerial photos and videos.

393
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,641
To do so for the flying cars,

394
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:31,928
how difficult it would be from the government's perspective, 

395
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:33,452
you can already imagine it.

396
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,322
Then comes the problem of noise pollution.

397
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:37,317
If you have flown any small drone,

398
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:39,271
you would have noticed the loud sound while flying it.

399
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:41,857
Or if you've gone closer to a helicopter,

400
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:43,711
it is on the next level.

401
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,369
That's why you need to put on headphones in the helicopter.

402
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:49,075
These same problems exist for flying cars.

403
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:52,703
These problems exist in Jetson 1 and AirCar too.

404
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:54,328
It creates a lot of noise.

405
00:16:54,557 --> 00:17:00,459
It is so noisy that it isn't practical to use it in the urban environment now.

406
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:03,887
To deal with this, a new technological innovation is needed.

407
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:08,021
So that the noise level of the flying cars can be reduced to a bearable extent.

408
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:11,588
Apart from noise, another area which needs some innovation is the

409
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:13,345
fast charging technology.

410
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:17,114
Nowadays, drones can be flown for up to 20 minutes only.

411
00:17:17,114 --> 00:17:19,698
How long would the flying cars last in the air?

412
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,388
With the present technology, 

413
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:23,968
it can fly up to 50 km only.

414
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:27,432
after that, they would need to be charged or refuelled.

415
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:29,044
And it takes up a lot of time.

416
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:30,762
These are the practical problems

417
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:32,521
that need to be solved in the future

418
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:34,595
for this technology to be successful.

419
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:37,136
Even if all these problems are solved,

420
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:39,327
the final problem to arise here

421
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,998
would be the cost.

422
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:42,656
After so many innovations,

423
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:45,059
the final price of the flying car,

424
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,809
would be at a level where people would actually want to buy it?

425
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:51,144
Will it be practical for people to buy it?

426
00:17:51,774 --> 00:17:55,085
Now the AirCar costs around $1 million,

427
00:17:55,085 --> 00:17:57,280
if the cost isn't affordable,

428
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,934
it would be very difficult for it to be truly successful.

429
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:03,797
This is valid for any new technology.

430
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:07,911
If the competing technologies are offered at a much better cost,

431
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,839
the competing technologies would be the ones to be successful in the future. 

432
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,657
If travelling by cars, trains and aeroplanes is at a much lower price,

433
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:19,403
in comparison to flying cars,

434
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:21,769
then the flying cars would never be successful.

435
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:22,989
