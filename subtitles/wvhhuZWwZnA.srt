1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,936
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,936 --> 00:00:02,449
6th January, 2004.

3
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:05,177
Dubai's sandy soil started being dug

4
00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:08,390
to build the tallest building in the world.

5
00:00:10,604 --> 00:00:12,280
Around the end of 2004,

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,483
world's tallest building was Taipei 101.

7
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:18,993
Located in Taiwan, this building was a little over 500m tall.

8
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:21,782
But the goal they set out to achieve in Dubai,

9
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:25,061
was unimaginable and record-breaking.

10
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:27,301
They wanted a building so tall

11
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,735
that not only would it be the tallest building in the world

12
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:33,575
but also be 62% taller than the second-tallest building.

13
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,164
The difference between the tallest and second tallest

14
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:39,079
would discourage anyone attempting to break its record.

15
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,316
Before Burj Khalifa, the previous world's tallest buildings,

16
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:46,449
were about 5%-10% taller than their predecessor.

17
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:49,231
At most, 19% taller.

18
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:54,358
But here, they were aiming to build it 829m tall.

19
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:56,516
A difference of 62%.

20
00:00:56,516 --> 00:01:00,237
It took about 5.5 years to construct this building,

21
00:01:00,237 --> 00:01:02,196
and on 1st October 2009,

22
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,336
the construction of the Burj al Khalifa ended,

23
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:07,117
and this building left the world astounded.

24
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:10,489
After the success of Burj Khalifa,
several countries announced that

25
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:12,446
they'll build even taller buildings.

26
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:13,869
Many attempted it.

27
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:15,952
But till now, all plans have flopped.

28
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:17,896
It has been more than 13 years,

29
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:21,068
and till now, the record set by Burj Khalifa remains unbeaten.

30
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:22,654
Why?

31
00:01:22,654 --> 00:01:25,827
Why is it so difficult to beat this record?

32
00:01:25,827 --> 00:01:28,148
And practically speaking,

33
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:30,612
how tall can the buildings built by humans be?

34
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:32,991
Come, in this video, let's try to understand this.

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,105
"When the Burj in Dubai is complete

36
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:40,850
it will be the tallest structure

37
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,985
that mankind has ever built on the face of the planet.

38
00:01:45,576 --> 00:01:49,019
Until someone builds an even bigger one."

39
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,911
"This is the story of the tallest tower

40
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,065
mankind has ever built.

41
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,564
Hald a mile high."

42
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:00,940
Friends, for about 4,000 years

43
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,309
the tallest structure built by humans was

44
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,234
It was built around 2500 BC

45
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:11,810
as a tomb for the Pharaoh Khufu.

46
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,600
Its height is 145m.

47
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,681
This record was broken only after the 1300s,

48
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:19,926
when a cathedral was built in England

49
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:22,253
that was ~160m tall.

50
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:25,798
For the next 500 years, this record was beaten by a series of churches,

51
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:29,222
until the Eiffel Tower was built in 1889.

52
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:31,184
But then, Eiffel Tower isn't precisely a building.

53
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:35,207
It's not a building in which people can stay or work in.

54
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:37,231
In terms of proper buildings,

55
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:40,611
this building by Chicago Home Insurance, built in 1884,

56
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:43,461
is known as the world's first skyscraper.

57
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:45,964
This was a building built for humans.

58
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:49,749
Where people went to work,
it was used as an office space.

59
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:51,884
Before this, the previous tall structures,

60
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:55,996
were either built for monarchs, or for Gods.

61
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:59,112
This was a major turning point in human history.

62
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,389
Though this building was only 55m tall.

63
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:04,271
Shorter than the Great Pyramid of Giza.

64
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:07,703
But only after this, did we get the innovation and technology

65
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:10,248
that we could build habitable skyscrapers.

66
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:13,230
When the competition to build tall buildings began,

67
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,117
it was limited to New York and Chicago.

68
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:19,586
Because America was the world's largest and most productive economy

69
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:21,235
till the end of the 19th century.

70
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:25,648
And these 2 cities were central to the most economic boom.

71
00:03:25,648 --> 00:03:28,342
Many people wanted to live in these cities.

72
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,611
Big companies wanted big office spaces,

73
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,833
and to accommodate people better in the city,

74
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,783
these skyscrapers had to be built.

75
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,464
Some honourable mentions here,

76
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:40,957
New York's Empire State Building.

77
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:45,944
It remained the world's tallest building from 1931 to 1971.

78
00:03:45,944 --> 00:03:48,339
It held the record for 40 years.

79
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:50,509
And in the modern context,

80
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:53,288
it held the record for the longest time.

81
00:03:53,288 --> 00:03:55,500
It was beaten in 1971

82
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,030
by another building in New York.

83
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,612
the World Trade Centre at 417m.

84
00:04:00,612 --> 00:04:04,650
9% taller than Empire State Building's 381m.

85
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,457
In 1998, the competition spread out of America,

86
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,400
and shifted towards Asia.

87
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,962
When the Petronas Towers were built in Kuala Lumpur

88
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:15,489
at the height of 452m.

89
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:19,248
They held the status of the world's tallest building till 2004,

90
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:21,570
after which, it was beaten by Taipei 101.

91
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,358
And in 2009, with the biggest margin,

92
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:26,738
Burj Khalifa beat all of them.

93
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:30,675
From 510m, to 829m.

94
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:33,323
Initially, when Burj Khalifa was being planned,

95
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:37,094
its initial proposed height was around 550m.

96
00:04:37,094 --> 00:04:41,539
During planning, they kept on increasing the height, until it was as tall as we know.

97
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:43,667
At that time, the brief of the tower was to

98
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,600
design a tower which was 550m.

99
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,251
Which was then slightly taller

100
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:49,583
than the world record holder at that time

101
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,015
which was Taipei 101.

102
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:53,609
We learned as we got into the project

103
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:55,295
that we could go higher.

104
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,023
And there was a desire to go higher.

105
00:04:57,023 --> 00:04:59,126
And not only break the record by a little bit,

106
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:00,913
but we could break it by a big margin.

107
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:03,079
The reason was that in the downtown area of Dubai

108
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,346
this building would be the centrepiece attraction.

109
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,509
Before the 1990s, Dubai was basically

110
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,981
a village for fishing and pearl diving.

111
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:13,089
That had discovered oil recently.

112
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:16,004
But by the late 1990s and the early 2000s,

113
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:17,779
the leaders in Dubai wanted

114
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,530
to diversify their economy.

115
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,717
To move beyond the dependence on oil.

116
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:25,003
They wanted to make Dubai an international tourism hub.

117
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:27,869
To grab international attention and 
to bring foreign investment, 

118
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,620
they had to do something to surprise the world.

119
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,692
Friends, Burj Khalifa is so tall

120
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:36,974
that if you jump out from its top,

121
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:39,291
it will take you 13 seconds to fall to the ground.

122
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,079
Without any air resistance.

123
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:44,098
But if you account for the air resistance

124
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:46,883
then, to fall to the ground from the very top,

125
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:49,372
it might take you up to 20 seconds.

126
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:51,037
Burj Khalifa is so tall that if you

127
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:52,847
watch the sunset from the ground,

128
00:05:52,847 --> 00:05:55,007
and then take the lift to its top,

129
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:57,089
you can watch the sunset again.

130
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:01,333
It cost $1.5 billion to build this.

131
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,367
With more than 12,000 workers,

132
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:05,692
with more than 100 distinct nationalities

133
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:08,187
and spend 22 million man-hours.

134
00:06:08,187 --> 00:06:11,203
But obviously, the purpose of building it

135
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,468
turned out to be quite successful.

136
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:17,185
Today, not only has Dubai become an international hub for tourism,

137
00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:19,415
but also an economic hub.

138
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:22,594
A large number of companies want to have their office in Dubai.

139
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:24,376
People were to live in Dubai.

140
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:25,739
Want to buy property there.

141
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:28,885
And the downtown area where this Burj Khalifa was built

142
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:31,006
property prices have skyrocketed so much

143
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:34,464
that this $1.5 billion was easily recovered.

144
00:06:34,464 --> 00:06:36,785
The question arises, what is so special about the Burj Khalifa

145
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:39,543
that makes it so difficult to beat it?

146
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:41,524
And if someone tries to build a taller building,

147
00:06:41,524 --> 00:06:44,762
realistically, how tall can we build?

148
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:46,356
To understand this, we need to first understand 

149
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:49,915
the problems that are encountered while building such tall buildings.

150
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:51,646
When such a tall building is built,

151
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:53,681
it needs to support its weight.

152
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,729
At those heights, the winds are quite strong,

153
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:58,133
so it needs to be ensured that there's no damage due to the winds.

154
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:00,621
And the Burj Khalifa overcame these challenges,

155
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,454
due to its innovative design.

156
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:04,609
If you look at the design from the top,

157
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:06,144
it's in a Y shape.

158
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:08,881
Similar to a tripod, this building has three wings.

159
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:13,377
Supported by a hexagonal core at the centre of the building.

160
00:07:13,377 --> 00:07:16,426
This structural system is known as the Buttressed Core.

161
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:20,699
This was invented by Burj Khalifa's structural engineer Bill Baker.

162
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,241
This structural system was used for the first time

163
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:26,150
in South Korea's Tower Palace 3.

164
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,667
With the height of 264m.

165
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,903
After its success, the architects realised that

166
00:07:30,903 --> 00:07:34,452
using this system can help build taller buildings.

167
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:36,477
And only with its help,

168
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:38,288
Burj Khalifa could be so tall.

169
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:41,643
So tall that the second-tallest building was 300m shorter.

170
00:07:41,643 --> 00:07:44,086
And Burj Khalifa was only the second building in the world

171
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:46,703
to use this Buttressed core system.

172
00:07:46,703 --> 00:07:48,286
With the help of this system,

173
00:07:48,286 --> 00:07:52,017
the impact of the strong winds that blow can be reduced.

174
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:55,612
Compare this to the new residential building in New York

175
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:57,281
that have been built very tall

176
00:07:57,281 --> 00:07:59,043
and fall under the category of Super Tall

177
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:01,530
but without using the Buttressed Core system.

178
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,257
What needs to be done in those buildings?

179
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:06,014
To be safe from the winds, a few floors must be left empty.

180
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:07,872
So that the winds could pass through.

181
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:09,823
Such as this 432 Park Avenue building.

182
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,195
Apart from this, Burj Khalifa's foundation,

183
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:15,581
has 192 concrete and steel columns under it.

184
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:17,820
They extend to 50m into the ground.

185
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,813
Similarly, the building above ground needed concrete too.

186
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:23,600
Concrete had to be delivered to the very top.

187
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,237
To do this, the world's largest concrete pumps were built

188
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:28,757
so that Burj Khalifa could be built.

189
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:34,170
The exterior of the building uses more than 100,000m² glass

190
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,063
as you can see in the photos.

191
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:38,371
But an even more surprising fact is that

192
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:40,106
the exterior of the Burj Khalifa

193
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:43,027
forms the world's largest LED screen.

194
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:43,721
That's right!

195
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:45,772
World's Biggest LED Screen.

196
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:49,459
This is why you can watch light shows on Burj Khalifa.

197
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:51,710
You can see colourful designs and patterns,

198
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,395
and even movie trailers.

199
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:56,466
Recently, before the release of the film Pathaan,

200
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:58,706
Shah Rukh Khan was in front of the Burj Khalifa

201
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:02,011
when the trailer of Pathaan was being shown on Burj Khalifa.

202
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:03,568
How can this be possible?

203
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:06,428
The entire movie trailer being shown on a building.

204
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:08,555
You might think that this is a projection.

205
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:11,203
That the trailer was being projected onto the building by a projector.

206
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:12,241
It wasn't.

207
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:14,376
There are LED lights on the building

208
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:17,988
Such as the tiny LED lights on your computer screens and TV,

209
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:22,177
There are 1.2 million LED lights on this building in total

210
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:24,508
From up close, the LED lights look like this.

211
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:25,952
Each light is quite large.

212
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:29,621
But if you see these 1.2 million LED lights from afar,

213
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:32,145
it'll feel as if you are watching a TV screen.

214
00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:35,630
It enables videos of any length to be played on this building.

215
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,253
And you might be wondering that when videos are being played,

216
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:43,652
won't it create problems for the people inside the Burj Khalifa? 

217
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:48,348
Wouldn't they see films playing on the windows or these lights?

218
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:49,970
No, they won't.

219
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,849
Next time when you visit the Burj Khalifa during the light show

220
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:55,137
look closely and you'll notice that these lights

221
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,536
aren't spread out all over the building.

222
00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:58,962
They are installed only on the frames.

223
00:09:58,962 --> 00:10:02,826
This is sufficient to display videos that 
can be enjoyed by an audience at a distance.

224
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:05,056
Friends, buildings this tall have another problem.

225
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:08,961
Suppose you are on the 160th floor of the Burj Khalifa,

226
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:10,519
and a fire breaks out in the building.

227
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,384
Will you climb down the stairs for 160 floors?

228
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:15,005
For such scenarios,

229
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:16,490
in cases of emergency,

230
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,616
after every 25 floors,

231
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:21,490
there are pressurised and air-conditioned refuge areas.

232
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,345
Additionally, staircases have been built with fire-proof concrete

233
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:25,705
to limit the spread of fire.

234
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:28,420
Friends, now let's see the buildings that can

235
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,351
be taller than the Burj Khalifa in future.

236
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:33,453
Here, it is interesting to note that,

237
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:35,078
over the last 12 years,

238
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:37,633
even though no building could beat the Burj Khalifa,

239
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:40,520
of the 20 tallest buildings currently,

240
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,087
17 have been built after the Burj Khalifa.

241
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:48,255
Such as the Merdeka 118 at 679m.

242
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:50,390
Under construction in Kuala Lumpur.

243
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,072
It will be officially inaugurated in mid-2023.

244
00:10:53,072 --> 00:10:56,265
But it has already become the second-tallest building in the world.

245
00:10:56,265 --> 00:10:57,680
Though it's a commendable effort

246
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,874
but 679m is still far from 829m.

247
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:03,964
But several buildings have been planned

248
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,671
to be taller than the Burj Khalifa.

249
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:08,209
Of which, at least 2 of the buildings

250
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,172
are already under construction.

251
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:12,499
The first is the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia.

252
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:14,499
If it is constructed as planned

253
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:18,050
it will be the first building to exceed the height of 1km.

254
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,170
Its design is quite similar to the Burj Khalifa,

255
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,070
because both buildings have the same architect.

256
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,610
Once again, Adrian Smith followed the Y-shaped design

257
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,001
to bring in structural integrity.

258
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:31,284
Once again, the purpose for building this

259
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,432
is to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy

260
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:35,192
so that it doesn't need to rely on oil only.

261
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:37,036
Similar to the Burj Khalifa,

262
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:40,623
this building would be used to build a new district.

263
00:11:40,623 --> 00:11:42,550
Jeddah Economic City.

264
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,140
The construction of this building began in 2013,

265
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,684
And about 1/4th of the tower was constructed

266
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:50,493
but unfortunately,

267
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:53,748
in early 2018 the construction was halted.

268
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:56,408
Since then, the construction hasn't restarted.

269
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:58,615
The thing is, between 2017-2019

270
00:11:58,615 --> 00:12:01,007
there was an anti-corruption purge in Saudi Arabia,

271
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:05,074
and the major investors investing in this project were arrested.

272
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:07,019
And then the Covid-19 pandemic hit.

273
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,372
And the delay still continues.

274
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:13,549
Publicly, no one knows when the construction will restart,

275
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:17,750
but if it is restarted, this is the only building that can break Burj Khalifa's record.

276
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,368
The second project that has a high potential

277
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:21,663
is in Dubai,

278
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:23,551
the Dubai Creek Tower.

279
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:26,625
This Creek Tower designed by a Spanish architect

280
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,706
will be an observation tower in Dubai.

281
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,306
It was planned around 2016-2018

282
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:33,300
and the foundation has been laid already.

283
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,092
but the construction is stopped here as well.

284
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:40,149
Originally, it was planned to be inaugurated during the 2020 Expo,

285
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:41,248
but it couldn't happen.

286
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:43,255
The exact height of this tower

287
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:45,154
has not been revealed yet,

288
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:50,461
but it is believed to be between 838m-1,300m.

289
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:53,663
This tower may beat the Jeddah Tower in terms of height,

290
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:57,688
but this tower will not fit into the tallest 'building' category.

291
00:12:57,688 --> 00:13:01,007
Because as per the plans, there will be no residential or commercial spaces here.

292
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:03,554
This is being planned as a simple observation deck,

293
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:04,885
Such as the Eiffel Tower.

294
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,786
But the construction is halted here as well.

295
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,681
And we do not know when and if it will restart.

296
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:10,062
So if not these two, which buildings

297
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:13,675
can beat the Burj Khalifa in future?

298
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:15,906
This question takes an imaginary turn here.

299
00:13:15,906 --> 00:13:17,710
Because the rest of the planned projects,

300
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,132
have been planned and announced

301
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,732
but work on them hasn't started yet.

302
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:26,430
Such as the Mubarak Al-Kabir Tower planned in Kuwait.

303
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,589
Proposed in 2007,

304
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:33,415
it was supposed to be 1,001m tall.

305
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:37,140
Its overall design was quite similar to that of the Burj Khalifa,

306
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,122
but construction has not begun on it.

307
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:41,638
So no one can estimate when it will be built.

308
00:13:41,638 --> 00:13:43,407
It is only a proposed plan now.

309
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,994
If this sounds like an amazing plan,

310
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:46,821
an even more astounding plan is 

311
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:48,842
the Sky Mile Tower in Tokyo.

312
00:13:48,842 --> 00:13:51,509
A 1.7km tall building.

313
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:53,846
For 500,000 people to live.

314
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:55,597
Look at the photos of this proposed building.

315
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:58,595
Its overall shape is similar to Burj Khalifa's.

316
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:01,692
But if such a tall tower has to be built,

317
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:04,718
it will be very challenging to control the winds.

318
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,711
This is why there are these big gaps in the proposed design,

319
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:11,559
so that the winds can flow through the building.

320
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,454
These are proper vertical slots,

321
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:17,047
and this project is included in a visionary megacity project. 

322
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:19,046
Known as the Next Tokyo.

323
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:24,486
The Japanese government will try to build a Next Tokyo near Tokyo.

324
00:14:24,486 --> 00:14:26,566
Till now, the plan is entirely theoretical,

325
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,007
construction hasn't begun.

326
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:30,260
But if it does begin, it is estimated that

327
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,567
it will be completed by 2045.

328
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:39,506
Overall, there's little chance that even in the next 25 years, there will be a building

329
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:42,020
that can beat the design of Burj Khalifa.

330
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,496
The innovative design that made it possible for Burj Khalifa to be so tall.

331
00:14:45,496 --> 00:14:47,207
Even in the past 10 years,

332
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:50,157
there were several projects for buildings taller than 800m, 

333
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:52,952
that were planned and then later cancelled.

334
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:55,843
Such as in 2012, in Azerbaijan,

335
00:14:55,843 --> 00:14:58,074
a 1km tall building was planned.

336
00:14:58,074 --> 00:14:59,154
It was later cancelled.

337
00:14:59,154 --> 00:15:04,805
In 2013, China planned to build an 838m tall Sky City Scraper,

338
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:07,886
due to environmental concerns, this didn't receive government approval,

339
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:10,675
this project was cancelled in 2016.

340
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:13,825
The plans beyond Tokyo's Sky Mile Tower

341
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:16,135
plans for taller buildings,

342
00:15:16,135 --> 00:15:19,594
are so imaginary, that they belong to the science-fiction category.

343
00:15:19,594 --> 00:15:23,202
Such as the plan for Tokyo's X-Seed 4000 building.

344
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:27,061
A visionary project of building such a tall structure in Tokyo,

345
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:29,073
A 4km tall building.

346
00:15:29,073 --> 00:15:30,846
Taller than Mount Fuji.

347
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,983
With 1 million people living in it.

348
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:34,621
It will look like this.

349
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:36,076
Like a mountain.

350
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:38,700
This was planned in 1995,

351
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,424
but this is only a plan,
no work has been done on this.

352
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:44,039
Another such plan is to build a Space Elevator.

353
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:46,752
A cabled structured so tall that 

354
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:48,600
it will take you to space, 

355
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,283
to ease transport between Earth and space. 

356
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:57,325
This is a theoretical concept that can be discussed in a separate video,

357
00:15:57,325 --> 00:15:59,916
and even so, it won't fit into the 'building' category.

358
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,917
So there's no use discussing this in this video.

359
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,288
The question remains, practically,

360
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:07,230
how tall can we build?

361
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,454
The structural engineer of Burj Khalifa, Bill Baker claims

362
00:16:10,454 --> 00:16:14,877
that if we use a modified version of the Buttressed Core,

363
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:18,754
we can possibly build a building with a height of more than 2 miles.

364
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:22,704
He says it's possible to build a building taller than 3 km.

365
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:26,840
He even claims that theoretically, we can build a building taller than Mount Everest. 

366
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,916
But practically, the problem would be

367
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,811
the taller the building gets,

368
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:34,233
the more weight you put on the floors at the bottom.

369
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:37,226
The force on the lower levels of the building,

370
00:16:37,226 --> 00:16:39,572
and the force of the strong winds at the top of the building,

371
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:42,982
will be the two major challenges in building the tallest building possible.

372
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:48,088
We can definitely use innovative design, engineering, and construction techniques, 

373
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:50,921
but what will happen if your material gives up?

374
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:53,077
As of now, the materials that we know of,

375
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:55,232
such as concrete, steel, aluminium,

376
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:56,742
all have a limit.

377
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:58,789
If we want to exceed these limits,

378
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:01,035
we will need to invent such materials

379
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:04,263
that are lighter and more durable than these.

380
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:06,648
A promising material that is said to be 

381
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:07,933
is Carbon Fibre.

382
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:10,025
Lightweight fibres made of carbon,

383
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:12,651
woven like a mesh.

384
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:14,875
It is stronger and lighter than steel,

385
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:18,969
and perhaps it will enable us to build taller buildings.

386
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:21,709
But before these complex engineering problems,

387
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,874
there will be the problem of the human body.

388
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:28,936
As buildings cross the mark of 1.5km-3km,

389
00:17:28,936 --> 00:17:31,071
the altitude will be so high

390
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:33,517
that there will be differences in the air pressure.

391
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:36,198
If you've gone to Leh Ladakh, you would've noticed,

392
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:40,240
how for the first couple of days there, you suffer nausea and dizziness,

393
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,887
because your body needs to acclimatise

394
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:46,345
due to the lower oxygen levels at the height.

395
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:49,827
When you climb a mountain, this can happen slowly,

396
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:52,091
but if we built such a tall building

397
00:17:52,091 --> 00:17:53,134
that's 2 km tall,

398
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:56,577
when you take the elevator to instantly go from the ground floor to the top,

399
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,389
your body will face the same problems unless

400
00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:02,422
the air pressure is controlled inside the building.

401
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:04,938
First of all, this will be extremely expensive,

402
00:18:04,938 --> 00:18:07,776
and secondly, it will mean that

403
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:09,948
balconies cannot be constructed on higher floors.

404
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:12,846
And even if you made them, no one would be allowed to go there.

405
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:14,403
These things will need to be kept in mind.

406
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:16,934
And even before the human body's problems

407
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:18,823
is the socio-economic limitaions.

408
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:22,547
The biggest problem why such buildings aren't built.

409
00:18:22,547 --> 00:18:23,640
Money.

410
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,653
There's no guarantee that each building will be as successful as Burj Khalifa,

411
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:30,434
that there will be such levels of economic boom around it.

412
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:33,424
Investors will need to spend thousands of millions

413
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:34,950
to fund such buildings.

414
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,776
Funding such buildings would mean extremely high risks.

415
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,536
How many people would want to fund it?

416
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,317
Additionally, this will require the support of the local government,

417
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:45,161
but many governments will not support these.

418
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:49,416
Because in most countries, funds could be better utilised.

419
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,395
In developing countries like India,

420
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:53,730
if the government invests all its funds in such projects

421
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,911
to build the tallest building possible,

422
00:18:55,911 --> 00:18:58,078
it will be a huge wastage.

423
00:18:58,078 --> 00:19:00,190
This is why even in China,

424
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,382
recently, the Chinese government passed a law that

425
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:05,881
that they will not allow any building to be built taller than 500m.

426
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:10,635
Any building being built taller than that would be simply for vanity.

427
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:12,438
Practically, it is a wastage of money

428
00:19:12,438 --> 00:19:15,291
The energy consumption of such a building would be very high

429
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,111
and public funds will be wasted.

430
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:18,900
And since there was no need, they banned it.

431
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,883
According to the laws of the Chinese government,

432
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:23,425
in cities with up to 3 million people,

433
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:27,111
the height limit for the skyscrapers has been set at 250m.

434
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:29,443
Friends, it is really important to pay attention to one thing here.

435
00:19:29,443 --> 00:19:32,287
there are very few cities all around the world

436
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:35,311
where the socio-economic factors would allow

437
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:38,419
the world's tallest building being built there.

438
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:41,242
About 100 years ago, these cities were New York and Chicago,

439
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:43,765
That witnessed an economic boom.

440
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,534
Hordes of people were moving in.

441
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:50,489
There was a demand to build more homes and offices in a limited space,

442
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,534
and so skyscrapers were born there.

443
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:57,389
In the 21st century, this was seen to some extent in Chinese and Taiwanese cities,

444
00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:01,029
that's why you see so many skyscrapers in those cities,

445
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:04,487
but they aren't so tall that they couldn't be profitable.

446
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:06,495
And then there were the Middle Eastern countries

447
00:20:06,495 --> 00:20:08,695
such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia,

448
00:20:08,695 --> 00:20:11,714
where the government wants to reduce oil dependence,

449
00:20:11,714 --> 00:20:14,047
and the government has a lot of money from oil,

450
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,434
So it was possible to do this in such places to a large extent.

451
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:21,346
Friends, this is the reason why, for now, and for the foreseeable future at least,

452
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:24,718
Burj Khalifa will remain the World's Tallest Building.

453
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:26,336
