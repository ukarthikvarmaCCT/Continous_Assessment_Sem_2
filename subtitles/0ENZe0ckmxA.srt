00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,280
- [Mark Rober] Today I helped MrBeast

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,840
conquer his fear of heights.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,040
It all started when I gave him

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,840
a tour of my secret lair CrunchLabs,

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,090
and after I showed him what
I call the fireman's piston,

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,059
he started to reveal his true colors.

7
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:11,892
- [MrBeast] Oh no.

8
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:12,740
Bro, I'm terrified.

9
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,100
How high is this?

10
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,940
- [Mark Rober] Turns out the dude

11
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,890
who spent 50 hours buried alive

12
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,990
was wimping out over an eight foot drop.

13
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,823
- I'm scared.

14
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:20,850
- [Mark Rober] But if
he just had more trust

15
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,720
in the laws of physics,

16
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,710
he wouldn't need to worry,

17
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,670
'cause when you step off,

18
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,020
you pull down on the rope,

19
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,880
and it pulls up on this plate,

20
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,350
but all the air in the chamber here

21
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,410
has to get squeezed out of
this tiny hole at the top,

22
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,790
and that creates a traffic jam.

23
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,430
And just like traffic jams in
real life slow down your car,

24
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,490
this one will slow you down
to a nice easy landing.

25
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,460
- You just reminded me that
I'm deathly scared of heights.

26
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,490
- [Mark Rober] At this point, I could have

27
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,920
put him at ease by telling him
just how many five year olds

28
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,030
had already made the jump,

29
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,614
but then again, watching
him suffer was way more fun.

30
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:51,840
(Mark Rober laughs)
(MrBeast sighs)

31
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,163
- Bro, I hate this.

32
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:56,850
(triumphant music)
(crowd cheers and applauds)

33
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,810
I'm never doing that again.

34
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,693
There you go. You got your freaking video.
