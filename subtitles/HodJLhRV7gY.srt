00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,014
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,014 --> 00:00:03,109
Shahrukh Khan's newly released film Jawan,

3
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:08,463
is breaking all records.

4
00:00:08,463 --> 00:00:11,428
This film is getting a lot of love from the public.

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:15,025
But do you know that more than half of the incidents shown in this film

6
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:17,105
are inspired by real life?

7
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:18,866
You will be shocked to know how

8
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:22,695
significant is the connection between
the things shown in this film and real life.

9
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:24,516
Let's find out in today's video.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,611
In this video, I won't give any major spoilers of plot points of the film.

11
00:00:33,611 --> 00:00:35,113
So, even if you haven't seen the film,

12
00:00:35,113 --> 00:00:37,040
you can watch this video without any hesitation.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,879
In fact, if you haven't seen the film,

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,427
you may get more curious to watch the film

15
00:00:41,427 --> 00:00:44,855
after seeing the real issues in this video.

16
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:48,182
Let's start with the second big scene 
of the first half of the film,

17
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,403
which is set in a government hospital.

18
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:52,120
In the film Jawan, it is shown how

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,844
young children in government hospitals die of encephalitis

20
00:00:57,844 --> 00:01:00,459
because oxygen may not be available.

21
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:03,375
In the film, a very sincere doctor, Iram, is shown

22
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:06,306
who tries her best to save the children.

23
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:08,380
But after this incident is made public,

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,966
the government frames this doctor instead.

25
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:13,349
A false accusation is put on her

26
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:15,001
and she goes to jail.

27
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:18,154
Something similar happened in August 2017

28
00:01:18,154 --> 00:01:20,487
in real life, in the city of Gorakhpur.

29
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:23,727
In a government hospital, BRD Medical College,

30
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:26,793
63 children died within 3 days

31
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:30,457
when the piped oxygen supply of the hospital ran out.

32
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,826
Dr Kafeel Khan was working as a paediatrician at that time.

33
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:38,976
When he came to know that the oxygen 
supply in the hospital was nearly over,

34
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:41,452
he tried to inform the authorities.

35
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:43,035
Since there was no response,

36
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:46,322
he tried to procure oxygen supply from himself

37
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:47,822
at his own expense.

38
00:01:47,822 --> 00:01:50,453
He is seen as a real-life hero.

39
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:53,582
But when the news of this incident reached the media,

40
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:57,871
the blame is shifted on the Dr Kafeel.

41
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:01,299
The government accused him of medical negligence and corruption.

42
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,767
He was suspended from his job,

43
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:07,794
arrested and then he was in jail for 9 months.

44
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,965
In an interview, he reveals how mercilessly he was beaten in jail.

45
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,187
He was starved for 4-5 days.

46
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:17,888
He was in such a bad condition that 
he couldn't sleep on his back for months.

47
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,010
"They used to make me naked,

48
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,600
they used to beat me with a stick.

49
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:25,384
They didn't give me food and water for 4-5 days!"

50
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:29,804
In April 2018, he finally got bail from Allahabad High Court.

51
00:02:29,804 --> 00:02:33,891
The court stated that there was no evidence of his wrongdoing.

52
00:02:33,891 --> 00:02:36,019
In 2017, an inquiry panel was set up

53
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,561
to investigate the allegations against him.

54
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:40,435
Even the panel stated that

55
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:44,480
the allegations against him are baseless and inconsistent.

56
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,820
In fact, this panel report states that

57
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,763
on 11th and 12th August,

58
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:50,474
due to his honest efforts,

59
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:55,183
more than 500 jumbo oxygen cylinders were 
delivered to this hospital by different companies.

60
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:59,024
The film Jawan shows how when the doctor had no other option,

61
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:01,564
she started giving Ambu bags to the parents.

62
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:03,092
This happened in real life too.

63
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:05,448
During the Gorakhpur tragedy, there were reports

64
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:07,159
that when oxygen was depleted,

65
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,754
parents were using Ambu bags to save their children's lives.

66
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:14,103
They were trying their best

67
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:17,334
and many parents saw their children dying in front of their eyes.

68
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:18,888
Dr Kafeel said that

69
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:20,550
he was made a scapegoat

70
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,860
and that it was a man-made tragedy.

71
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,541
More than 30 letters were written to the authorities of BRD Medical College

72
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,046
and to the UP government.

73
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:29,829
Bills of 6.3 million rupees were pending

74
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,486
to the oxygen suppliers

75
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:33,965
which were not paid for months.

76
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:36,507
Again and again, the letters asked them

77
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,229
to pay the oxygen suppliers

78
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:41,230
so that the oxygen supply to the hospital would not be disrupted.

79
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,197
Just one day before the Gorakhpur tragedy,

80
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:45,483
on 9th August,

81
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:50,558
Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Adityanath visited this hospital himself.

82
00:03:50,558 --> 00:03:53,317
I made a video on everything that happened at that time,

83
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:56,618
if you haven't seen it, I'll put the link in the description.

84
00:03:56,618 --> 00:04:00,551
We often hear that the state of government 
hospitals in the country is very bad,

85
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:02,319
but how bad is it actually?

86
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,508
And what impact does it have on people's lives?

87
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:07,533
We got to know this from this film

88
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:08,842
and from Gorakhpur Tragedy.

89
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:11,242
To improve the condition of these government hospitals,

90
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:13,150
a bold statement is given in the film.

91
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,394
It is said that if there is a will,

92
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:18,176
then all these hospitals nationwide

93
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:20,500
can be improved in just 5 hours.

94
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,447
This thing is quite filmy,

95
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:24,668
but in real life, I believe that

96
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:25,916
even if not in 5 hours,

97
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,942
but definitely, in 2 to 3 weeks,

98
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:30,342
all hospitals can be improved.

99
00:04:30,342 --> 00:04:33,630
And you can bring this efficiency and speed to your life

100
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,680
if you use AI tools like ChatGPT.

101
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,295
Believe me, I use ChatGPT daily

102
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,871
and my efficiency has skyrocketed to the next level.

103
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:43,740
Latest studies also show that

104
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,799
ChatGPT can give innovative ideas faster 
and better compared to MBA students.

105
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:53,261
It can easily pass law exams, business school exams.

106
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:58,294
That's why, friends, I have created a 
4.5-hour-long Master ChatGPT course in Hindi

107
00:04:58,294 --> 00:05:02,181

109
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:06,816
And those who are not using it,

110
00:05:06,816 --> 00:05:08,538
don't know what they are missing.

111
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:09,983

00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:22,021
It will be applicable for the first 400 people,

117
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,019
so you can try it out quickly.

118
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:25,594
Now let's get back to the topic.

119
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:27,803
The second major issue that has been shown in the film is

120
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:29,151
faulty weapons.

121
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:31,157
Our soldiers are martyred in our country

122
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:32,534
not by the bullets of the enemy,

123
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:35,211
but because of our own faulty weapons,

124
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:37,306
which are manufactured

125
00:05:37,306 --> 00:05:39,156
by some crony capitalists.

126
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:43,161
In reality, there have been many reports on this over the years.

127
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:45,994
In 2012, the Chief General of the Indian Army, V.K. Singh,

128
00:05:45,994 --> 00:05:48,254
wrote to PM Manmohan Singh

129
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:51,000
and said that the Army's tank fleet

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,710
was in dire need of critical ammunition.

131
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,299
In 2015, retired Lieutenant Colonel Deepak Malhotra

132
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:59,381
filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court,

133
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:02,893
with the accusation that due to bureaucratic hurdles,

134
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:06,693
our soldiers have to use weapons of poor quality,

135
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:09,255
which puts their lives at risk.

136
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:12,273
In this PIL, an interview of an injured soldier was mentioned,

137
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:16,279
in which he talked about how due to defective INSAS

138
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,551
a massacre took place in Chhattisgarh.

139
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:21,436
In 2017, a CAG report mentioned that

140
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:24,189
40% of the Indian Army's ammunition

141
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,008
is at such low levels that

142
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:27,564
if a war breaks out,

143
00:06:27,564 --> 00:06:29,641
they will not last more than 10 days.

144
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:35,487
In 2018, the Indian Army rejected 
Made in India rifles for the second time.

145
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:39,725
Because these Made in India rifles failed badly during trials.

146
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:41,587
These reports are not yet over.

147
00:06:41,587 --> 00:06:42,742
Listen to more.

148
00:06:42,742 --> 00:06:46,198
In 2020, an internal army assessment flagged that

149
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,441
due to such bad weapons,

150
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,458
In the last 6 years, 403 accidents have taken place

151
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,539
and 27 soldiers have been martyred

152
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,863
at a loss of 9.6 billion rupees.

153
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:00,000
These weapons were supplied by the Ordnance Factory Board.

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,107
After this, in September 2022,

155
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:04,122
last year's Bloomberg report states that

156
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:08,286
because of PM Modi's Make-In-India push,

157
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:13,096
our defence forces are not able to import some critical weapons systems.

158
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:17,694
Because of this, India is quite vulnerable to 
threats coming from China and Pakistan.

159
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:19,842
I would like to show you a report from this year.

160
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:23,837
In the last 5 years, around 55 soldiers have lost their lives

161
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:26,969
in more than 50 aircraft and helicopter accidents.

162
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:28,914
In a bigger time frame,

163
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,730
there was a report in 2022,

164
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,512
which stated that more than 400 MiG-21s crashed in the last 60 years.

165
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:39,942
Due to this 200 pilots and 60 civilians lost their lives.

166
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:43,459
This issue was also raised in the film Rang De Basanti if you remember.

167
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,801
This is a major plot point of the film.

168
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:47,923
Now let's come to our third big issue,

169
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:49,549
Corporate Funding.

170
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:51,166
In the film Jawan, it is shown how

171
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,430
corporate money is secretly used

172
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,623
for funding the political parties.

173
00:07:56,623 --> 00:08:00,410
In 2017, there was a major development regarding this.

174
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,660
Modi government had passed the Finance Bill, 2017

175
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,704
through which giving secret donations to political parties was allowed

176
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:10,390
through Electoral Bonds.

177
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,726
This bill also removed the limit

178
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:16,276
on how much money can be given to a political party in donations.

179
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:17,729
How much money was given?

180
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,148
This year, in January, a report was published,

181
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:24,480
which said that during 2018-2022, BJP

182
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,666
received ₹52.70 billion of funding secretly.

183
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,635
We don't know who provided this funding,

184
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,520
because that was the aim of the bill they passed.

185
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,674
They wanted to hide their funding.

186
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:37,164
According to this report, during this time

187
00:08:37,164 --> 00:08:40,510
Congress party received ₹9.60 billion in funding

188
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,239
and Trinamool Congress received ₹7.67 billion.

189
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:46,613
In 2014, Narendra Modi had promised that

190
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:50,053
he would bring the black money from Swiss banks back to India.

191
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:51,390
"For once,

192
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,477
the money that has been deposited in 
foreign banks by these thieves and robbers,

193
00:08:55,477 --> 00:08:57,353
if we bring back the money,

194
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:58,945
even by doing so,

195
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:01,392
every single poor man in India

196
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:04,366
will get ₹1.5-₹2 million for free."

197
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:06,161
But what have they done here?

198
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:09,709
They have hidden all the money that is received by their parties.

199
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,916
Now, whether it is BJP, Congress or any other party,

200
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,812
the public cannot know who is funding them.

201
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:17,030
We can just take a guess from the outside.

202
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,040
Another thing worth mentioning here is that

203
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,342
there is an expenditure limit

204
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:23,909
to what a candidate can spend on his political campaign.

205
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:25,690
This depends on the state

206
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,942
but in Lok Sabha elections, this limit is 
between ₹7.5 million to ₹9.5 million.

207
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:34,286
If we take the upper limit for every seat in Lok Sabha,

208
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:37,083
543 seats multiplied by ₹9.5 million,

209
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,806
it is around ₹5 billion.

210
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:44,268
So, technically, no political party can spend more than ₹5 billion.

211
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:45,920
Going over the expenditure limit is not allowed.

212
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,742
However, the report of the Centre for Media Studies has shown that

213
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:54,254
the BJP has spent ₹270 billion 
in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019.

214
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:56,589
Just think about the difference.

215
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:58,385
Even if you ignore this report,

216
00:09:58,385 --> 00:10:03,169
in November 2019, BJP submitted to the Election Commission

217
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,804
as it is written on the website of the Election Commission

218
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:12,827
that BJP has spent ₹12.64 billion for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

219
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:15,187
The maximum limit here is ₹5 billion

220
00:10:15,187 --> 00:10:16,989
and they are spending ₹12 billion.

221
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:17,943
How?

222
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:19,230
Is this a joke?

223
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,133
In the film Jawan, it is shown that the villain of the film

224
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:23,621
is telling foreign investors how

225
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:25,607
voters in India can be bought.

226
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:27,887
If you pay ₹10,000 to each voter,

227
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:30,778
they will vote for the payer's preferred political party.

228
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:32,643
This is shown wrongly in the film

229
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:34,541
because ₹10,000 is a huge amount.

230
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,524
In our country, we see that

231
00:10:36,524 --> 00:10:41,510
people sell their vote for a kilogram of chicken 
or a quarter of whisky.

232
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,527
Obviously, it depends from region to region

233
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:46,387
on how much money is used to buy voters.

234
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:48,324
But in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,

235
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:52,558
there were seizures worth ₹34.56 billion.

236
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:57,060
It includes cash, gold, silver, alcohol, drugs, everything.

237
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,502
And forget about buying voters,

238
00:10:58,502 --> 00:11:00,488
there's a new trend in the market.

239
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:03,535
Political parties buy MLAs,

240
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:05,461
they buy media houses.

241
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:08,165
"Casinos, horse trading, horse racing."

242
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:10,695
And then these MLAs and media houses that have sold themselves

243
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:13,042
play a game of divide and rule with the public,

244
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:14,881
spreading hatred among the people

245
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:18,279
so that their political masters can remain in power.

246
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,855
The film also raises the issue of the environment of the country.

247
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:24,109
How several industrial factories

248
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:26,699
pollute our air and water.

249
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:29,856
In the film, there was a reference to the Bhopal gas tragedy

250
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,934
which happened in December 1984.

251
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:33,692
I will not talk about this here because

252
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,800
I have made a separate video on this.

253
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,781
If you haven't seen it, I will put the link in the description.

254
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,641
But it is not about just one tragedy,

255
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:41,894
not about just one incident.

256
00:11:41,894 --> 00:11:44,523
This has become so common that it is unbelievable.

257
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:46,372
Just do a random Google search

258
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,756
and see the numerous articles pop up.

259
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:49,717
Let's start in 2006.

260
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:51,277
In Chhattisgarh, due to iron ore mining,

261
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,561
the water of two rivers got polluted

262
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:56,087
and 100 villages that were on the banks of the rivers,

263
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:59,989
the villagers living there had to use contaminated water

264
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:02,103
for their daily needs.

265
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:05,684
In 2013, a report by the Center for Science and Environment shows that

266
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,923
80% of Indian sewage

267
00:12:08,923 --> 00:12:11,350
is dumped untreated into rivers.

268
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,372
Who is doing this?

269
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:16,094
Thousands of factories are dumping untreated sewage in rivers.

270
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:20,922
In 2017, "Maharashtra's polluting factories 
are making its rivers the filthiest in India."

271
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:22,453
In September 2018,

272
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:26,220
Magsaysay Award winner 
environmentalist Rajendra Singh said that

273
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,555
the government's Namami Ganga project is failing.

274
00:12:29,555 --> 00:12:33,374
In October 2018, G.D. Agarwal, a pass-out of IIT,

275
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:34,777
became a sadhu.

276
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:37,144
Swami Gyan Swaroop Sananand.

277
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:40,294
To save the River Ganga, he went on a fast.

278
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:44,602
His demand was that a Ganga Protection Act be drafted by the government

279
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:46,441
and a total ban be imposed on

280
00:12:46,441 --> 00:12:49,739
quarrying and stone crushing on the banks of the River Ganga.

281
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:52,116
He had also written a letter to PM Modi,

282
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:53,379
but there was no reply.

283
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:55,917
His fast lasted 111 days,

284
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:58,339
after which he passed away due to starvation.

285
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:00,736
"The man who dedicated his life to get River Ganga cleaned,

286
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:02,507
environmentalist G.D. Agarwal

287
00:13:02,507 --> 00:13:04,945
finally sacrificed himself for River Ganga."

288
00:13:04,945 --> 00:13:08,556
After that PM Modi did express his condolences.

289
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:10,718
The budget of the Namami Ganga project was

290
00:13:10,718 --> 00:13:12,456
₹200 billion.

291
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:14,553
Its deadline was 2021.

292
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:17,217
This year, Namami Ganga Mission 2 was approved.

293
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:19,825
With a budget of ₹225 billion.

294
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:22,103
The deadline was set for 2026.

295
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:25,581
The Minister of State for Jal Shakti [Water Resources]
 clearly told the Rajya Sabha that

296
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:27,980
this time their main objective

297
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,887
is to meet the water quality criteria of outdoor bathing.

298
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,964
Not to make the water of River Ganga drinkable.

299
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:36,308
Only so clean that it becomes bathable.

300
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:38,847
They will try to make it happen by 2026.

301
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:40,623
Let's move ahead, there are other rivers as well.

302
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:41,919
This article from 2021,

303
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:47,672
Karnataka dumps 1,746 million litres of sewage in the rivers every day.

304
00:13:47,672 --> 00:13:49,956
40% untreated.

305
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:53,383
Experts say that factories and industries should be blamed for this.

306
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:54,880
April 2022,

307
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,473
the water of the River Hindon in Noida, Uttar Pradesh

308
00:13:57,473 --> 00:14:01,473
is so bad that it is not even safe to bathe there.

309
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,945
September 2022,

310
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:04,841
the water of the River Damodar in Jharkhand

311
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:06,038
has become toxic.

312
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:08,781
People are getting sick by using this water.

313
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,115
Local power stations and mining companies

314
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:15,559
dump large mountains of ash in this river to save money.

315
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:18,754
In 2023, the Central Pollution Control Board says that

316
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:21,623
there are 413 industries in Haryana in total

317
00:14:21,623 --> 00:14:25,586
which are discharging untreated wastes into the river.

318
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:26,932
Panipat is at number one

319
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,067
with 181 polluting factories.

320
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:30,876
Gurgaon is at number two

321
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:33,090
with more than 100 such factories.

322
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,354
This is why the villain in the film Jawan

323
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:37,661
openly tells foreign investors in the film

324
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:40,859
to invest their money in winning elections,

325
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,698
to invest in donating to the parties,

326
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:45,033
so that they will get the freedom to do anything in India.

327
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:47,339
To set up as many factories as they want,

328
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,524
to use as much cheap labour as they want,

329
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:51,192
to spread pollution and waste,

330
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:52,207
and no one would care.

331
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:53,491
The villain of the film also says that

332
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:56,135
India's environmental regulations are very favourable

333
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:57,855
for big companies.

334
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,140
In other developed countries, there are a lot of restrictions

335
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,667
that are not there in India.

336
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,740
For example, some pesticides are banned in other countries

337
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,143
but are allowed in India.

338
00:15:06,143 --> 00:15:07,990
The Supreme Court was hearing a petition

339
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,535
demanding a ban on 116 dangerous pesticides.

340
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:15,949
In 2013 the Anupam Verma Committee was constituted

341
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,613
to investigate these dangerous pesticides.

342
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:21,621
This committee reviewed only 66 pesticides

343
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,541
and submitted its report to the government in 2015.

344
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,889
But the government remained inactive for years

345
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:29,031
and when the government took action in 2018,

346
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:32,533
only 12 pesticides were banned by the government.

347
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:36,025
And it said that 6 other dangerous pesticides would be slowly phased out.

348
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:38,720
Out of the 116 dangerous pesticides,

349
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,233
they took steps to ban only 18.

350
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,880
After this, another committee was formed under SK Malhotra

351
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,665
in which some more pesticides were to be reviewed.

352
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:50,001
This committee in 2020 said that

353
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:52,501
27 pesticides should be banned in India.

354
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:54,933
In 2022, the government formed another committee.

355
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,523
And what action did that committee take?

356
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,528
Only 3 pesticides were banned.

357
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:01,026
That too in February 2023.

358
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,337
So now you can understand the attitude of the government.

359
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:07,188
They are not worried about the citizens 
but about the crony capitalists.

360
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:09,690
If they ban any more pesticides,

361
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,243
then the business of these billionaires will be affected.

362
00:16:13,243 --> 00:16:14,990
They should not have to bear the loss.

363
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,028
In July 2023, the Supreme Court questioned the government.

364
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:22,313
The Supreme Court said that whenever a committee issues a report,

365
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:24,104
instead of taking action on that report,

366
00:16:24,104 --> 00:16:26,130
the government makes a second committee.

367
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,289
Why is it so difficult

368
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:30,178
to ban these dangerous pesticides

369
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:31,944
which are already banned in other countries?

370
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:35,198
After this, we can talk about food safety regulations.

371
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:37,247
Look at this 2017 news.

372
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,431
Experts say that poultry farms in India

373
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,266
are using antibiotics.

374
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,961
Antibiotics are being given to hens in such heavy doses that

375
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,499
this antibiotic resistance is reaching humans.

376
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:49,655
This means that if humans catch a disease

377
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:51,488
that has become antibiotic-resistant,

378
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:53,617
then the antibiotics will not help these humans.

379
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:56,460
After this, the government did something good here

380
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,644
in 2017, they set a permissible limit

381
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:03,361
on how much antibiotics can be given to hens.

382
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:05,461
But look at this news from 2018.

383
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:07,292
"India's farmed chickens

384
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,172
are dosed with the world's strongest antibiotics."

385
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:13,664
This study was done by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism

386
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:17,395
which found that a last resort antibiotic, Colistin,

387
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:20,448
is being given in heavy doses to many chickens in India.

388
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:23,339
Only in 2019, the Union Health Ministries took action on it

389
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,289
and banned this antibiotic.

390
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:27,034
So, even where action is being taken,

391
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,606
they are waiting for a report first,

392
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:30,000
only then any action is taken.

393
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,560
This should tell you the importance of free media.

394
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,859
If all the media in a country has been turned into political representatives,

395
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:36,733
then such reports will not be published

396
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:39,309
and the government will never have to take any action.

397
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,019
Without these reports, the government 
never takes any action on these things.

398
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,494
Compare it with other countries.

399
00:17:44,494 --> 00:17:51,251
The European Union banned antibiotics 
from being used in animal feed in 2006.

400
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:53,739
They took action so many years ago.

401
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,924
This year, in January, the European Union 
came out with a new legislation 

402
00:17:56,924 --> 00:18:00,367
which has banned all kinds of antibiotics in farming.

403
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:02,070
And they have also banned

404
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,972
meat that has antibiotics in it

405
00:18:04,972 --> 00:18:08,276
being imported from foreign countries to the European Union.

406
00:18:08,276 --> 00:18:10,906
Now see how these multinational food companies

407
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:13,555
take advantage of the indifference of the Indian government.

408
00:18:13,972 --> 00:18:17,006
In 2017, KFC was praised in America

409
00:18:17,006 --> 00:18:21,407
because they committed not to use antibiotics in their chicken.

410
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:24,635
In the same year, Burger King, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell,

411
00:18:24,635 --> 00:18:25,905
all took this pledge.

412
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,359
There will be no antibiotics in their chicken.

413
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:30,253
But did any of these fast food companies

414
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:32,238
make such a commitment in India?

415
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:36,631
Center for Science and Environment 
reached out to these companies in 2020

416
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:40,124
and they did not respond to this issue.

417
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:42,076
In the movie Jawan, it is also shown how

418
00:18:42,076 --> 00:18:46,247
the government forgives the bad loans of these billionaires.

419
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:48,225
If you want to compare it with real life,

420
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:49,880
see this news from just last month.

421
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,113
The Minister of State for Finance told the Lok Sabha,

422
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:55,334
that in the last 9 years, the banks

423
00:18:55,334 --> 00:19:00,117
have written off ₹14.56 trillion in NPAs.

424
00:19:00,117 --> 00:19:03,762
More than half of these were owed by large corporates.

425
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:06,622
And when the banks try to recover these loans,

426
00:19:06,622 --> 00:19:08,997
the banks are unable to recover the entire amount.

427
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:13,594
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman 
told the Rajya Sabha this year in March

428
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:16,668
that in the last 5 years, the public sector banks

429
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:20,209
could recover only 14% of the written-off loans.

430
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:23,596
Apart from these NPS, there are cases of such billionaires

431
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,512
who have taken loans from banks

432
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:26,831
and fled the country.

433
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:29,890
Like Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, and Mehul Choksi.

434
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,010
The film Jawan drew an interesting comparison

435
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,219
of loan write-offs for these billionaires and crony capitalists.

436
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:40,578
And the loans owed by common farmers in the country.

437
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:43,596
Look at this India Spend report of 2019.

438
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:46,136
The cost of the top 12 corporate NPAs

439
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:51,263
is twice as much as compared to farm loan waivers.

440
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:54,967
Between FY 2017-18 and February 2019,

441
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,737
10 state governments issued farm loan waivers

442
00:19:57,737 --> 00:20:01,453
whose total amount was ₹1.848 billion.

443
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:03,911
But the top 12 NPAs,

444
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,958
their total amount is almost twice this.

445
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,637
At ₹3.45 billion.

446
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:11,167
And when the farmers' loan is waived,

447
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,779
there is another big difference.

448
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,778
If the farmer is unable to repay his loan,

449
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:17,597
he often commits s____de.

450
00:20:17,597 --> 00:20:19,317
But these billionaires,

451
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:24,065
have you ever heard that they committed s____de 
because they couldn't repay their loans?

452
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:26,979
There is a very powerful scene related to this in Jawan.

453
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:28,783
I won't talk much about it.

454
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:31,252
If you have seen the film, you will understand

455
00:20:31,252 --> 00:20:32,850
what I am talking about.

456
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,917
When a farmer takes a loan,

457
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:36,749
it affects his life entirely.

458
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,483
If you see just one year, in 2021,

459
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:43,646
more than 10,000 people committed s____de in the farm sector.

460
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:46,083
The number shown in the film was quite shocking.

461
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,979
But the number in real life is close to it.

462
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:51,926
There are farmers in our country that earn substantially.

463
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:54,254
They should be seen as positive examples

464
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,298
so that other farmers can learn from them.

465
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,148
Watch this video of Down to Earth.

466
00:20:58,148 --> 00:21:00,496
How can a small farmer earn ₹1.5 million?

467
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:04,578
Or watch this video featuring Padma Shree awardee Bharat Bhushan Tyagi

468
00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:10,053
which shows how a farmer earns more 
than ₹500,000 per acre annually.

469
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:13,058
Or you can read this article of The Better India

470
00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:15,523
which shows the story of a farmer Raju Titus.

471
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:18,336
All these farmers can earn so much money

472
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:20,825
because they follow the NFC model.

473
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:23,733
NFC means Nature Farmer Consumer.

474
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,631
There may be some minor differences,

475
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:27,827
but what do these farmers do in general?

476
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:29,803
Number 1, seed preservation.

477
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:32,499
They preserve the seeds in seed banks.

478
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,830
They are often members of friendly seed banks.

479
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,339
Number 2, they do not use chemical fertilizers.

480
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,734
Instead, they restore soil fertility

481
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:43,461
by planting cover crops in between the cash crops.

482
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:45,818
This increases microbial activity in the soil

483
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:47,991
and increases nitrogen availability.

484
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:52,581
And such farmers often use a compost pit for manure.

485
00:21:52,581 --> 00:21:56,102
Number 3, they often get their soil tested in local labs

486
00:21:56,102 --> 00:22:01,070
to find out the most suitable crop to grow in the soil.

487
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,674
They also practice crop rotation.

488
00:22:02,674 --> 00:22:04,842
Number 4. Monoculture.

489
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:06,724
Instead of planting one type of crop,

490
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:07,767
they carry out intercropping.

491
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:09,854
Multiple crops in one field

492
00:22:09,854 --> 00:22:11,549
That would support each other.

493
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:13,897
Number 5. They do multi-layer farming.

494
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:18,033
3 to 4 crops are grown on the same field at different heights.

495
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:22,456
For example, coconut, coffee, and black pepper 
can be a combination.

496
00:22:22,456 --> 00:22:24,815
Or maize, green gram and ground nut

497
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:26,570
can be another combination.

498
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:28,848
Next, they don't use a tractor.

499
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:32,148
They often use no-till farming techniques.

500
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:34,404
And they don't use flood irrigation either.

501
00:22:34,404 --> 00:22:38,973
Instead, they use techniques like sprinkler irrigation or drip irrigation.

502
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:41,657
And instead of using pesticides and insecticides,

503
00:22:41,657 --> 00:22:45,693
they use marigolds, garlic or bright-coloured sheets.

504
00:22:45,693 --> 00:22:48,297
Next, they follow the practice of mulching.

505
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:50,689
They cover the remaining area with organic matter 

506
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:52,680
so that weeds can be suppressed

507
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,716
and that water can be retained in the ground. 

508
00:22:54,716 --> 00:22:58,517
And finally, these people don't dump their produce in the market.

509
00:22:58,517 --> 00:23:01,062
Instead, they are organised in cooperatives

510
00:23:01,062 --> 00:23:03,431
and reach the consumers directly.

511
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:05,279
They don't let middlemen in.

512
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,445
This is an amazing model in which

513
00:23:07,445 --> 00:23:10,620
the farmer is happy, the consumer is happy,
 and the environment is also happy.

514
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,489
But this model is used rarely

515
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:15,966
because most of the people who are practising this model

516
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:17,785
are educated and intelligent.

517
00:23:17,785 --> 00:23:22,502
However, poor farmers use the corporate model of farming.

518
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:27,969
They buy seeds, fertilizers, insecticides, 
pesticides, and tractors.

519
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:31,099
They use diesel to run the tube well.

520
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:33,082
They rent a harvesting machine.

521
00:23:33,082 --> 00:23:35,489
They burn the leftover stubble

522
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:37,127
which causes air pollution.

523
00:23:37,127 --> 00:23:40,286
As time goes by, their soil becomes less fertile.

524
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:42,979
So they keep adding more fertilizers to it.

525
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:47,879
And in the end, they dump all their stuff in the market.

526
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:50,481
Often, they take a loan for a tractor as well.

527
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:53,476
And their crop often gets destroyed during the rains.

528
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:55,658
This model is very expensive.

529
00:23:55,658 --> 00:23:57,431
The revenue for the farmers is meagre.

530
00:23:57,431 --> 00:23:59,658
And it has a bad impact on the environment.

531
00:23:59,658 --> 00:24:03,577
And because these corporate companies work like middlemen,

532
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:06,254
the consumers have to pay a high price.

533
00:24:06,254 --> 00:24:09,563
And most of the profits are taken by these companies in the middle.

534
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:14,723
These companies that make tractors, 
fertilizers, and insecticides,

535
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:16,540
are billion-dollar companies.

536
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,040
And often, the profits cannot reach these farmers

537
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,786
because this knowledge has not reached most of the farmers.

538
00:24:22,786 --> 00:24:25,138
The government had promised that by 2022,

539
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:27,034
they would double the farmers' income.

540
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,290
But it's 2023

541
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,399
and the farmers are in the same condition.

542
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:33,610
A while ago, the government tried to bring in 3 unfavourable laws

543
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,187
which would have increased the corporate income.

544
00:24:36,187 --> 00:24:37,986
But thankfully, it didn't pass.

545
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:39,938
What should the government do?

546
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,357
Educate the farmers.

547
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:44,335
To inform the farmers which models they should adopt.

548
00:24:44,335 --> 00:24:47,751
What they should be doing to maintain their livelihood.

549
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:49,181
If there is a political will,

550
00:24:49,181 --> 00:24:51,882
the government can bring down these farmer s____des to zero.

551
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:53,517
But will this happen?

552
00:24:53,517 --> 00:24:57,278
Or will the YouTubers have to educate the farmers?

553
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,264
Only time will tell.

554
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:03,404
If you liked the video, do keep these 
issues in mind while watching the film.

555
00:25:03,404 --> 00:25:05,183
And if you liked the video, you can click here

556
00:25:05,183 --> 00:25:07,776
to watch the video on the Bhopal Gas Tragedy.

557
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:09,139
See you in the next video.

558
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:11,063
Thank you very much!
