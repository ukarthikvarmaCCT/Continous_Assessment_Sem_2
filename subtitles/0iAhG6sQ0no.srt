1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,934
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,592
On 4th January, 2024,

3
00:00:02,592 --> 00:00:04,917
on his social media handles, 
Prime Minister Modi

4
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:07,499
posted some pictures from Lakshadweep.

5
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:13,100
Although there was no 
mention of Maldives in these pictures,

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,762
some politicians in the Maldivian government

7
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:18,756
reacted to these pictures in a way

8
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:21,147
that led to years of friendship 
between the two countries

9
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:22,720
being in danger today.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,848
In a few days, the situation becomes so serious that

11
00:00:24,848 --> 00:00:28,528
#BoycottMaldives started trending on social media.

12
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,041
The 3 ministers of the Maldivian government,

13
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,906
who caused the controversy are

14
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:34,369
Mariyam Shiuna,

15
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:35,775
Malsha Shareef and

16
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:36,973
Abdullah Mahzoom Majid.

17
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:40,035
Their comments on India and the Indian Prime Minister,

18
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:43,067
look to be born out of insecurity.

19
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:45,202
They believed that PM Modi's agenda

20
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:47,507
was to make Lakshadweep and Maldives compete.

21
00:00:47,507 --> 00:00:50,042
But these comments included some personal attacks too

22
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:53,565
On Twitter, Mariyam called PM Modi, 
"a puppet of Israel."

23
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:56,030
Her colleagues said that these photos from Lakshadweep

24
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,359
aimed at challenging the tourism industry in the Maldives.

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,731
And Mahzoom Majid stereotyped Indians

26
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:03,619
and made hateful comments against India.

27
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:06,226
Sharing photos of open urination he said that

28
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:07,770
it is a part of Indian culture.

29
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,659
These led to an outright conflict on social media.

30
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:12,715
When the Indians started posting that they

31
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:16,432
are cancelling their flight and hotel bookings,

32
00:01:16,432 --> 00:01:19,517
the Maldivian government understood the seriousness

33
00:01:19,517 --> 00:01:21,671
and the Maldivian Foreign Ministry stated that

34
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:24,927
the opinions expressed by the ministers

35
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:26,579
were their personal opinions and

36
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:29,354
did not represent the views of the Maldivian government.

37
00:01:29,354 --> 00:01:33,005
Later, the government suspended these 3 ministers.

38
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:37,247
But the point isn't about 
Maldives versus Lakshadweep only.

39
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:39,616
Not just about this social media war.

40
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:43,272
The whole controversy was driven by hateful politics.

41
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:46,770
A geopolitical agenda which led to all of this.

42
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,940
Let's understand it in today's video.

43
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:58,260
One thing you all would know is that

44
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,379
Maldives is a small country.

45
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:04,384
The total population of this country 
is only around 500,000 people.

46
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:06,336
This country is made up of numerous islands.

47
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:08,209
In fact, there are more than 1,000 islands.

48
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,101
But out of these 1,000 islands,

49
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:12,901
only about 200 are inhabited.

50
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,530
Where humans live.

51
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,577
And out of these 200,

52
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:18,661
more than 150 islands are resort islands.

53
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:21,026
They have been sold to private companies.

54
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:23,707
And those companies have their private resorts on it.

55
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:31,009
Obviously, the country depends heavily on tourism.

56
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:34,756
28% of Maldives' GDP depends on tourism.

57
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:38,130
And 90% of the tax revenue for the government,

58
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,473
comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes.

59
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:43,042
And an interesting fact is that

60
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:44,696
India is the number one country

61
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:47,382
based on the number of tourists visiting Maldives.

62
00:02:47,382 --> 00:02:51,393
In 2023, more than 200,000 Indian tourists went to Maldives.

63
00:02:51,393 --> 00:02:55,103
In total, approx 1.75 million tourists 
went to Maldives this year.

64
00:02:55,103 --> 00:02:57,669
So you can imagine a country with a population of 500,000,

65
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:00,261
hosting more than 1.7 million tourists in a year.

66
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:01,876
But the relationship between India and Maldives

67
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:04,133
is much deeper than that of tourism.

68
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:07,142
For years, India and Maldives have been strategic allies

69
00:03:07,142 --> 00:03:10,208
and there has been military cooperation between the two too.

70
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,577
India has played a special role in initiatives like SAGAR.

71
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:14,886
SAGAR stands for

72
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:16,857
Security and Growth for All in the Region.

73
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:20,206
Around 2008, India launched its Neighbourhood First Policy,

74
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:22,301
and improved relations with Sri Lanka, Maldives,

75
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:24,779
Nepal, Afghanistan, Bangladesh,

76
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:26,930
Pakistan, and Myanmar.

77
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,068
About 77 Indian military officers and soldiers

78
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:32,027
are present on the Maldives islands

79
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:35,948
additionally, two Dhruv Advanced Light Helicopters

80
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:40,022
were donated by India to the Maldives in 2010 and 2015.

81
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:43,084
There are many reasons behind this 
military presence and helicopter donation.

82
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:45,001
Such as helping during natural calamities,

83
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,877
conducting search and rescue operations,

84
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:50,288
airlifting medical patients between islands.

85
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:53,035
But apart from this, India's warships patrol the

86
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:56,121
exclusive economic zone of the Maldives too.

87
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:58,227
This is the sea area surrounding Maldives

88
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:01,805
where illegal activity is prevented.

89
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:03,140
Basically, to prevent terrorism.

90
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,626
Maldives had requested India to do this.

91
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,688
In 2009, when the Maldivian government

92
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:12,031
were concerned about potential 
terrorist attacks in their country,

93
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:14,012
they had asked India for help

94
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:17,423
because they did not have the capabilities 
in terms of military assets and surveillance.

95
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,370
But this help and India's military presence

96
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,236
has become a major issue of controversy 
in Maldives' internal politics for the last few years.

97
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:28,463
Some political parties in Maldives completely oppose this

98
00:04:28,463 --> 00:04:31,176
and want India to withdraw its military.

99
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:34,576
In fact, Maldives' current President, Mohamed Muizzu

100
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:37,813
and his political party, People's National Congress,

101
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:39,641
used this issue during their election campaign

102
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,071
and came to power.

103
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:43,118
The issue of "India Out."

104
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:44,411
To understand this better,

105
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:46,991
we have to take a look at Maldives' internal politics.

106
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:51,693
The thing is, the country was 
under dictatorship for 30 years.

107
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:53,567
It was only in 2008

108
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:56,291
that a new constitution was adopted

109
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,950
and a multi-party democracy system 
was established in their country.

110
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,432
The elections that were conducted in 2008

111
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:07,816
was won by the Maldivian 
Democratic Party or MDP in short

112
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:10,970
and their new President was Mohamed Nasheed.

113
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,747
He was a successful president for the first 4 years of his term.

114
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,154
He spread awareness on climate change issues,

115
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:20,359
pledged to make Maldives carbon neutral

116
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:22,780
and his foreign policy was India First.

117
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,434
During his term, India and Maldives became close allies.

118
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:28,971
And as I said, in 2009, on his request,

119
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:31,913
India donated military equipment to Maldives.

120
00:05:31,913 --> 00:05:35,631
But in 2012, a political crisis broke out in Maldives.

121
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:38,399
And the next year, in 2013, 
when elections took place,

122
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,151
a new party came to power.

123
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:43,164
The Progressive Party of Maldives or PPM.

124
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:46,118
The President was Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom.

125
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:47,826
And with the change in the governing party,

126
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:49,546
the foreign policy of the country also changed.

127
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:52,019
This new party opposed India.

128
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,345
In 2016, their new government stated that

129
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:57,862
India can take back the 
2 helicopters that were gifted to them.

130
00:05:57,862 --> 00:05:59,426
After distancing themselves from India,

131
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,309
Yameen's government got closer to China.

132
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:04,353
Chinese companies were given contracts for

133
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:07,113
major infrastructure projects in the Maldivian islands.

134
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:09,002
And in the meantime, 
Maldives became a part of

135
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:12,071
China's Belt and Road Initiative.

136
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,737
Under this initiative, China wants to spend money

137
00:06:14,737 --> 00:06:17,160
on large infrastructure projects

138
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,962
in different countries across the world

139
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,379
by building roads, railways, and ports

140
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:24,840
to increase its influence in Asia, Africa, and Europe.

141
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,521
Most of the loan terms of Chinese contracts

142
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,007
were quite unsustainable.

143
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:32,511
Because of this, many countries fall into China's debt trap.

144
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:37,260
During this time, Maldives borrowed 
$1.5 Billion from China.

145
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,748
Friends, here I'd like to say that

146
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:41,758
if you couldn't understand any part in my video,

147
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:45,014
you can use ChatGPT as an assistant.

148
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:47,130
What is China's Belt and Road Initiative?

149
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,623
You can simply ask this.

150
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:52,394
It can explain, in simple terms,
why many countries are deep in debt.

151
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:54,858
And not only in English, ChatGPT can

152
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:56,366
answer your questions in Hindi or Hinglish too.

153
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:58,612
Similarly, for many such tasks

154
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:00,530
ChatGPT is a useful software.

155
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,125
This is why I made a 4.5-hour-long 
course to master ChatGPT.

156
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,812
This course is in Hindi with English subtitles.

157
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:10,123
In it, you can learn how ChatGPT

158
00:07:10,123 --> 00:07:12,622
can help students, employees, and business owners

159
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:16,850
to increase their productivity and efficiency.

160
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,670
Next week, a new 1-hour long bonus 
content will be added to the course.

161
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,247
Recently, I conducted a workshop in 
Dubai's 1 Billion Summit,

162
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:24,880
it was on ChatGPT,

163
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,512
You can watch the entire workshop in this course.

164
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:30,154
If you have already purchased the course,

165
00:07:30,154 --> 00:07:31,759
it is a free update for you.

166
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,394
But if you haven't,

167
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:35,184
do check it out.

173
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:46,962
Now, let's get back to the topic.

174
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:47,964
Because of this government,

175
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:50,458
relations between India and Maldives got weaker

176
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:54,264
and India's strategic position in this area starts weakening.

177
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:57,088
After this, the next election was in 2018,

178
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:58,917
once again, the governing party changed

179
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:01,152
and so did the foreign policy of the country.

180
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:04,362
In 2018, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih from MDP

181
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:05,898
became the President.

182
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:07,536
And the first thing he did was

183
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:10,838
the Indian helicopters that Yameen wanted to send back,

184
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:12,731
Solih extended the contract of those Indian helicopters.

185
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:15,698
He wanted to keep those helicopters in Maldives.

186
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:18,770
Once again, they adopted India First strategy.

187
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,118
Thereafter, India helps the Maldivian government.

188
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:24,194
India provides billions of dollars to Maldives

189
00:08:24,194 --> 00:08:27,167
so that they could repay the loan

190
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,229
taken by the previous government.

191
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:30,668
Even during the Covid pandemic,

192
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:33,388
India provided vaccines in Maldives.

193
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,254
One thing to note here is that

194
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:37,075
even when Maldives wasn't a democracy,

195
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:38,727
during the 30-year dictatorship,

196
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:42,015
India-Maldives relations were still strong.

197
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:44,760
Like in 1995, India built

198
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,986
Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Maldives.

199
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:49,759
It is still the largest hospital in Maldives.

200
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,508
Back to 2020,

201
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:53,506
this new MDP government

202
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:57,371
was extremely enthusiastic about 
the India First sentiment.

203
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,024
Many bilateral agreements were signed

204
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:01,981
between India and Maldives during this time.

205
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:06,013
India granted $500 million for maritime connectivity.

206
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:10,911
A Line of Credit of $800 million 
was given by Export-Import Bank of India.

207
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,735
Due to this India First's proactive approach,

208
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:16,482
an undercurrent was spreading across the country.

209
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:18,514
The sentiment of India Out.

210
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,402
The politicians in the opposition had a

211
00:09:22,402 --> 00:09:24,868
negative outlook towards the alliance between

212
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:27,099
the Indian government and the Maldivian government.

213
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,829
By 2021, many journalists had written articles about it,

214
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:32,434
numerous posts had been made on social media,

215
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:34,774
which were openly criticising India

216
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,437
and in many ways, degrading India.

217
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:40,139
Politicians were also giving hateful speeches

218
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,046
to end India's presence from their islands.

219
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:45,659
Seeing all this, the Indian High Commission in Maldives

220
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:48,845
wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Maldives

221
00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:52,108
stating that the articles and social media posts

222
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:54,234
were attacking Indian dignity.

223
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:55,540
They asked the ministry to do something about them.

224
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,547
This letter was leaked to Maldives' media.

225
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:01,305
On 2nd July 2021, the MDP government

226
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:03,541
officially apologises to India.

227
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,273
And expresses concern that

228
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:07,560
some people who are spreading hatred against India

229
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,879
on Maldivian media and social media.

230
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,727
Acknowledging it as wrong.

231
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:13,889
Here, a local news publication DRS was mentioned

232
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:16,225
with their co-founder Ahmed Azaan.

233
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:18,239
Specifically, pointing out that

234
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,896
they are the people spreading Anti-India hate.

235
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:24,825
Regarding India Out slogans, Ahmed Azaan gave a statement

236
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:30,958
that the campaign does not mean that they 
want to expel the Indians from Maldives.

237
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,411
They do want Indians to be safe in their country.

238
00:10:33,411 --> 00:10:35,540
And that the India Out movement means that

239
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,849
they want to expel the Indian military from their country.

240
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:40,670
And that the people using the India Out campaign

241
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,001
to threaten the Indians

242
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:45,558
and to attack Indians

243
00:10:45,558 --> 00:10:46,696
are in the wrong.

244
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:49,856
He called it an issue-based movement.

245
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,255
So the point is

246
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:52,798
if this is an issue-based movement,

247
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:54,173
then what are their issues?

248
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:56,230
The opposition politicians claim that

249
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,536
the agreements entered into by the MDP government with India

250
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:01,154
are very confidential

251
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:03,981
and their details are not revealed to the public.

252
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:07,274
The then Vice President of their opposition party, PPM,

253
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:08,816
Mohd Shareef said that

254
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:11,490
if the details of the agreement

255
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,297
are not presented to the country,

256
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,787
it is a violation of democracy.

257
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:19,132
The government should not hide the details 
by citing the excuse of national security.

258
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:21,465
He used the example of the Harbour project

259
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:24,282
on the Uthura Thila Falhu Island in Maldives.

260
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:26,532
A joint defence action plan was signed

261
00:11:26,532 --> 00:11:28,852
between India and Maldives in February 2021.

262
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,476
where India's job was to develop and

263
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:34,041
maintain the harbour of this coast guard.

264
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,118
Leaked documents suggest that

265
00:11:36,118 --> 00:11:37,409
according to this agreement,

266
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:39,917
the Indian military could stay here for decades

267
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:43,241
and they would have the exclusive rights to this facility.

268
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:46,957
Many Maldivian citizens were 
genuinely upset after hearing this.

269
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:50,283
Even those who were not 
supporting the India Out campaign,

270
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:52,575
started supporting the opposition.

271
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:56,499
And because of this, when the next 
elections were conducted in 2023,

272
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:58,347
the governing party changed again,

273
00:11:58,347 --> 00:12:01,444
and the PPM party that was the opposition,

274
00:12:01,444 --> 00:12:03,269
came back into power.

275
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,030
This time, this PPM party

276
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,635
formed an alliance with PNC party to be in power.

277
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:10,586
And the latest President of Maldives,

278
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:11,650
Mohamed Muizzu,

279
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,706
was the candidate of this right-wing party, PNC.

280
00:12:14,706 --> 00:12:17,363
This happened on 30th September, 2023.

281
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:22,523
This political party, which focused on the 
India Out issue during their election campaign

282
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:24,182
is in power today.

283
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:25,764
It is also worth noting that

284
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:29,802
had the previous MDP government been more transparent

285
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:32,898
and had not kept the agreements so confidential,

286
00:12:32,898 --> 00:12:35,216
then perhaps the India Out sentiment

287
00:12:35,216 --> 00:12:36,723
would not have gained so much traction.

288
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,979
And perhaps, they could have remained in power.

289
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:41,954
But now, since this PPM party came into power,

290
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:48,387
they took this India Out issue 
even more seriously than last time.

291
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:50,385
Their new president Mohamed Muizzu,

292
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:54,580
openly stated, four days after winning the election

293
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,101
that Indian forces in Maldives

294
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:58,866
will have to leave the country.

295
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:01,767
On 17th November 2023, 
he became the President officially,

296
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,486
and only a week later,

297
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:04,746
on 23rd November,

298
00:13:04,746 --> 00:13:07,639
he met Indian Union Minister Kiren Rijiju.

299
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,722
He repeated the same points in the meeting

300
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:13,470
that India withdraw its military personnel from Maldives.

301
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,113
And it was only a month and a half later

302
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:18,702
that the Muizzu's ministers

303
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:20,979
openly started insulting PM Modi and India

304
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:23,339
on public platform.

305
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,748
When this happened, the ex-Presidents of Maldives

306
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:27,682
and the MDP party,

307
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:32,301
obviously, stood up in favour of India.

308
00:13:32,301 --> 00:13:34,385
Mohamed Nasheed and Ibrahim Mohamed Solih

309
00:13:34,385 --> 00:13:38,542
both condemned this hateful language against India.

310
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,668
Now that you know these, you can understand

311
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:43,636
that it was never about Lakshadweep.

312
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:47,498
This was entirely about Maldives' internal politics.

313
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,568
This India Out sentiment

314
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:52,343
is a way for some Maldivian politicians

315
00:13:52,343 --> 00:13:53,946
to incite their citizens

316
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:57,398
and to score more votes with their hateful speeches.

317
00:13:57,398 --> 00:14:01,195
In 2021, when the MDP government was in power 
and India Out slogans were raised,

318
00:14:01,195 --> 00:14:03,932
then one of the MDP ministers Ali Azim had said that

319
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:06,163
this anti-India movement was

320
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:08,689
happening because some people

321
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:10,774
enjoy making hateful speeches.

322
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:12,518
Today, this is a great example of how

323
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:17,424
hateful politics can be harmful to a country.

324
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,768
You will find such politicians not only in Maldives

325
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:21,703
but in every country in the world.

326
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:25,261
They either spread hatred against a community,

327
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:27,461
against a religion

328
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,073
or against another country.

329
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:32,013
What's unfortunate is that,

330
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:36,202
many people get misled by such 
hateful speeches and the fear they create.

331
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:38,441
If we look at the foreign policy of the new Maldivian government,

332
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:41,491
it is once again leaning towards China.

333
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:43,383
Maybe it's just a coincidence that

334
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,573
this entire controversy started just a day before

335
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:49,350
the Maldivian President's visit to China.

336
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,557
His trip to China was from 8th to 12th January.

337
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:53,846
The Chinese state-sponsored media

338
00:14:53,846 --> 00:14:55,418
praised this situation stating that

339
00:14:55,418 --> 00:15:00,636
"it demonstrates that Muizzu is treating 
India with a normal mindset

340
00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:03,596
and steering the relationship between Maldives and India

341
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:05,807
to a normal state-state relationship."

342
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,977
It is also historic that

343
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:11,738
Muizzu chose China for his first foreign trip.

344
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:14,470
All the Maldivian presidents before him,

345
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,536
came to India on their first foreign trip.

346
00:15:17,536 --> 00:15:20,261
Just two days ago, on 10th January,

347
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:22,052
after this controversy began,

348
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:26,888
President Muizzu extended an 
invitation to Chinese tourists

349
00:15:26,888 --> 00:15:28,663
to visit Maldives.

350
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:31,041
Since Indians started boycotting the country,

351
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,803
he is openly inviting Chinese tourists to his country.

352
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:37,744
So, the entire issue here 
is about Maldives' internal politics.

353
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:39,726
The parties in favour of China

354
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:41,834
versus the parties in favour of India.

355
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,370
This also reveals that

356
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,070
if the governing party changes once again
in Maldives in 4-5 years,

357
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,339
and the pro-India party comes to power,

358
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:51,921
then India's stance towards Maldives can change again.

359
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:54,762
The boycott Maldives slogans that are trending now,

360
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:57,259
can turn into Go to Maldives slogans,

361
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:58,722
after a few years.

362
00:15:58,722 --> 00:16:01,581
But regardless of what happens in Maldives' politics,

363
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:04,927
we can always promote Indian tourism.

364
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:06,473
One thing that we need to be cautious about is that

365
00:16:06,473 --> 00:16:08,427
while promoting local tourism,

366
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:12,934
the local biodiversity and the local 
population should also be cared for.

367
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:17,199
Tourism should not be at the cost of 
environment and the livelihoods of the locals.

368
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,851
If you liked this video, you will 
like this video on geopolitics too,

369
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:23,584
in which I have talked about how 
countries all over the world

370
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,940
promote the weapons industry.

371
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,019
And why the United Nations fails in such cases.

372
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:30,823

Thank you very much!
