1
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:20,661
This is incredible!
- What's happening in our village?

2
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:23,701
At this rate, nobody in our
village will be safe anymore

3
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:26,301
A daylight robbery! Something
needs to be done about it!

4
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:30,221
He's the victim today. Tomorrow,
it could be anyone

5
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:34,261
Right! Something needs to be done.
- Where are you guys going?

6
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:37,341
You come along, too. Or she'll
carry you away too!

7
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:45,981
Will he help? - He's the only
one in the village...

8
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:50,621
who can solve the problem. We'll
have to fall at his feet!

9
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:52,061
Right! You're right!

10
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:53,941
What happened?
- Are your ears blocked?

11
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:55,701
No.
- So come on

12
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:01,861
What's happening? Is it
something scandalous?

13
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:08,061
Nobody knows. Narayan Dada's son
was carried away by a witch

14
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:18,061
Look at them! The bloody
herd of sheep!

15
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,861
They're here to chew on our
brains, early in the day!

16
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:22,461
Say we're closed for a fortnight.
- What for?

17
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:25,141
The DCP's mother's getting
married again

18
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:33,661
Where are they going?
- They just walked by!

19
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:49,741
Entry to women is forbidden...

20
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:03,261
Am I going to walk there to help?
Come here and talk to me

21
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:12,141
Why are you guys wailing?
What's wrong?

22
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:15,901
You are our Lord and Master!
Our saviour in trouble!

23
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:20,341
Why? Where are your other saviours?
- But you are the most powerful!

24
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:24,301
My son has been carried
away by Kartaniya's men!

25
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:28,061
Kartaniya? Who's this lizard?

26
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:32,101
That woman from the cattle market!
- She has abducted his son!

27
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,941
Is she going to pickle him?

28
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,661
Are the cops around only to have
photos taken of their shining medals?

29
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:41,341
Go and tell them that
I've sent you. Dismiss!

30
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,941
We went to the police, sir.
We even mentioned your name

31
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:47,661
But the witch still wouldn't
spare his son!

32
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:53,221
So you're at my feet because you're
disillusioned with the police?

33
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:56,541
I don't poke my nose in
other people's affairs

34
00:03:57,661 --> 00:04:00,861
I fight only my own battles.
Go on now, get going

35
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:05,821
That witch gets all her help from
the lady in Anpara village, sir

36
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:10,821
Laxmi's goons are standing in
attendance, to defend them

37
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,061
Lawyer...
- Sir?

38
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,701
Use the phone. Summon
my kids immediately

39
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:23,501
No, sir. We ought not to
interfere in this matter

40
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,861
Why not?
- It has to do with womenfolk

41
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,541
You never know what twist
the tale might take

42
00:04:30,141 --> 00:04:33,021
Don't you guys knows? Seth
Angarchand's men...

43
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:38,341
never get involved with women!
And you still come here?

44
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:40,901
Go away now! Mind your own
business! - Listen...

45
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:41,821
Yes, sir.

46
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:46,781
As far as I can see, this is
no ordinary case of women

47
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:50,301
The lady at Anpara and her children
are involved in this scandal

48
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:52,781
She's a very stubborn woman.

49
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,181
If anyone asks me for help against her,

50
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,301
I'm surely
going to help him!

51
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:06,621
Sir, call for you

52
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:13,101
Balli, come home immediately.
- Right, Daddy

53
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:16,061
lmmediately.
- Right away. Immediately

54
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:26,181
Hail Lord Hanuman,
Lord of Celibacy...

55
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:27,501
Phone for you, sir

56
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:30,621
Shakti, see which fool it is

57
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:35,981
Who the hell is it?

58
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:40,221
Your mother was nurturing a spirit
wasn't she? I'm the same ghost!

59
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:44,061
Brother! It's Daddy.
- Daddy who?

60
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:44,861
Daddy!

61
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:51,101
Daddy, talk to brother...
- No. Come here immediately

62
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:54,181
Right, Daddy. We'll
start immediately

63
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,341
Hold this for a moment

64
00:05:57,741 --> 00:06:00,581
Well? You couldn't recognise
my father's voice?

65
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,141
I don't tell my father's
voice either

66
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:04,301
I'll play your father's
voice for you right now!

67
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:07,101
Is this the law college
boys' hostel? - Yes

68
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,901
I wish to talk to Jaichand.
- I'll call him

69
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:16,381
Who is it? Go on?

70
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:18,621
Didn't you go to college today?

71
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,501
Daddy?

72
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:26,581
I went, came back. And
went again and...

73
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:30,741
Is that a carrom-board you've
been bouncing off?

74
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:33,301
I'm going back in the
afternoon, daddy

75
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:36,621
No, no need to go there.
Come home immediately

76
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:38,821
No, I'm really going in
the afternoon, daddy

77
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:41,981
Must you keep raving,
you idiot? Listen to me

78
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,621
We got some important business to
finish. Come here immediately

79
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:18,541
Wow! All the wealthy men together!
At the poor man's door?

80
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:25,021
So you're the poor man who abducted
a poor farmer's son?

81
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,901
And you now want to swallow
his piece of land in ransom?

82
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:33,421
Bring that boy here immediately.
- So you've come to take the boy?

83
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:37,501
He's not coming out, sir.
- He can't? Never mind

84
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,701
We can walk. We'll carry him

85
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:45,701
No, none of you guys can
take him away from here

86
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:47,781
We are taking him away

87
00:07:48,341 --> 00:07:51,301
We don't use our expensive footwear
to walk to such places

88
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:58,381
Sir, this is a cattle-market. I
clean scatter with these hands...

89
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:01,021
I use this hand to wash my backside

90
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:03,581
A punch with this one
will stink even more

91
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,701
I'm not standing in the
hot sun for too long

92
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:12,861
Finish it all up quickly. Let's go

93
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:47,261
Which sonofagun dares take
away the boy from here!

94
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:53,701
Dammit! Silly bachelors!

95
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:59,461
How would you know what
heat a woman possesses?

96
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:04,141
Is there a real man among you
who can sate a woman's thirst?

97
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:07,101
If there is, step forth, you curs!

98
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:13,101
I'll show you what it means
to flee with a turned tail!

99
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:21,861
Get out of the way.

100
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:23,261
Let go of that child.

101
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:35,101
These are the people responsible
for all this bloodshed and violence

102
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:38,781
And the father and the sons ought
to be punished for their crimes

103
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:40,781
That's all, your honor.

104
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:51,821
Dear students, today happens to be
Anjali's last day at the college

105
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:58,101
But it saddens me to say that
an intelligent girl like her...

106
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:03,661
is abandoning her studies
to settle down in matrimony

107
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:08,901
However, it is a matter of pride
that Anjali is getting married...

108
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:13,581
to the Home Minister of our State,
the young Mr Govindrao Pachpute

109
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:18,461
I therefore extend our heartiest
congratulations to her

110
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:23,101
We hope there will be fame
and honor in her life

111
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:28,541
Let us therefore give
her a happy farewell

112
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:35,741
Anjali, listen...
- What?

113
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:38,261
Will you please help me?

114
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:41,501
What happened?
- This

115
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:44,421
What is this?
- My transfer order

116
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:47,741
You can have a word with the
Minister and have it stalled

117
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:50,301
Me?
- Yes, you

118
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:54,861
Now don't say you can't do it.
- I'll do what I can

119
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:12,701
Bye. - Bye, take care.

120
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:15,861
Give it to him on your nuptial
night. Don't forget!

121
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:18,501
Come. - Bye.

122
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:29,661
Spray the rose-water,
elephant! Spray it!

123
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:33,301
Spray the rose-water, elephant!

124
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:35,261
What sort of a mahout are you?

125
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:37,501
You can't make the elephant
spray the rose-water?

126
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:39,261
Give me the cane. I'll show you

127
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:44,181
Sprinkle the rose-water,
elephant! Go on!

128
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:54,261
There, Mother! The rose-water
and also the oblations!

129
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,541
What are you guys watching?
Clean the mess!

130
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:07,901
Sprinkle the rose-water, elephant!
Sprinkle it! - Sprinkle. - Keep going.

131
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,061
Who're you giving those dirty looks?

132
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:14,861
Who asked you to bring
the elephant here?

133
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:17,181
I did.
- What are you doing, Ma?

134
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:19,861
There's work held up in the fields
because the elephant's not around...

135
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:23,101
and you're holding a farce here?
A circus on display?

136
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:26,301
Circus? My grand-daughter's
getting married...

137
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,901
if the elephant sprinkles
rose-water, does it become a farce?

138
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,461
Have you forgotten the pride
of the high-caste families?

139
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:35,181
You call a sacred ritual a circus!

140
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:38,461
In that case, why don't you get the
elephant to serve the guests...

141
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:43,901
who arrive at the wedding? The
village will witness the honour!

142
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:48,381
An elephant serving food!
- Viru! Don't try to play my father!

143
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:52,741
What the elephant will sprinkle
on the people of Anpara...

144
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:55,661
I will decide, not any servant

145
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,981
But mother...
- Enough! Go inside

146
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,061
Brother Pratap, what's going
on with you around?

147
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:06,941
There'll be 10,OOO guests! And the
elephant's going to be around!

148
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:10,661
So you want me to sprinkle
rose-water on the guests?

149
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:13,941
Oh no, go ahead and build muscles!

150
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:15,861
I wonder what burden you're
going to carry!

151
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:19,901
Now look, Vir, if you're irked,
go and tell brother Surajbhan

152
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,741
There's no need to eye my
muscles! Is that clear?

153
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,421
There you go again!

154
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,861
Can't the two of you digest
anything unless you argue?

155
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:32,021
Vir, you don't want the elephant to
be there at the wedding, right?

156
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:33,101
Yes, brother

157
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:36,741
I've stuffed a kilo of cotton
in the elephant's ears!

158
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:40,061
That's when I brought it here!
Even if a bomb explodes...

159
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:46,301
the elephant won't hear a thing!
- That's very nice... well done!

160
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:50,261
Why don't you stuff some cotton
in your mother's ears too?

161
00:13:51,421 --> 00:13:56,701
Remember one thing. It's the
marriage of a motherless child

162
00:13:57,581 --> 00:13:59,421
There'll be not just elephants...

163
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:01,661
...there will be fireworks
at her wedding too!

164
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:07,741
We will invite only those people who
will bless her with all their heart

165
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,981
Do you understand that?
My foot you will!

166
00:14:18,301 --> 00:14:20,061
Grandma...
- My princess has arrived!

167
00:14:20,941 --> 00:14:23,901
My darling daughter has arrived!
Come, dear...

168
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:30,861
I hear the Home Minister's fiancee
had a grand send-off at the college?

169
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:35,621
Don't poke fun at her! It's
commonplace in colleges nowadays

170
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:38,021
Studies take a back-seat. Fun
and frolic take centrestage!

171
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:42,701
Why not? My friends came to see me
all decked up at my wedding too

172
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,861
Anjali... how are you?

173
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:50,541
Oh sure! You married this mountain,
and were laden with gold, isn't it?

174
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:56,581
Enough. - Where's daddy? - He has
gone to meet the Home Minister

175
00:14:56,821 --> 00:14:59,221
He mustn't have been around, so he
must've stood around like a guard?

176
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:03,501
The Minister hasn't disappeared!
Get lost! He'll come back

177
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:11,421
Lord...

178
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:15,981
Where the hell are they?
- What's up, lawyer?

179
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:20,821
Send half a dozen men, please.
I can't carry this burden on my own

180
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:25,341
Really? Listen... lend
the lawyer a hand

181
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:30,181
Looks like the Home Minister has
sent a lot of gifts... hurry up!

182
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,061
Hurry up and get him out

183
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:36,141
What happened, brother-in-law?

184
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:40,141
What happened to him? - Let him get
some fresh air... Get some water!

185
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:43,821
But how did this happen to him?
- Daddy? What happened?

186
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:46,861
The cat got your tongue? Won't
you tell us what happened?

187
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:51,181
All I can say is that this
wedding is not taking place

188
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:59,301
The Home Minister claims that this
alliance is posing problems for him

189
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,461
And I say he's being instigated...

190
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:03,341
...so that our daughter's
wedding is stalled

191
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:07,501
Stall my grand-daughter's wedding?
Who dares? Tell me!

192
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:11,621
It's no good wringing my neck!
Rather you strangle Angarchand's neck!

193
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:13,221
He's the one who has had
this wedding called off

194
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:16,661
He has lured ten legislators
to his fold.

195
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:18,981
He has threatened the
Home Minister...

196
00:16:19,381 --> 00:16:24,061
to call off the wedding, else he'll
be toppled off his position

197
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:27,221
And that is why he has refused
to go ahead with the wedding

198
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:32,741
And you know! Death, mosquitoes and
politicians are not to be trusted!

199
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:38,061
That's it! Bravo! Slam him to
the ground! - Flattened him.

200
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:43,061
Eat all you want to, let there
be no room in your tummy

201
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:47,661
There's no feast at Anpara anymore.
- There'll only be a mourning there

202
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:50,261
They were forging an alliance...

203
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:52,301
...with the Home Minister
to belittle Angarchand!

204
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:54,861
And now her own grand-daughter
sits humiliated at home!

205
00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:58,381
I spat because the people of Anpara
have gone down on their knees...

206
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:00,301
...before me

207
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:03,821
Why did you have to spit?
One single spit was enough

208
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,581
I spat because you spat
on my face, sir

209
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:09,421
But you sat before me with
your mouth wide open!

210
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:12,061
Where else could I spit?
Go and sit elsewhere!

211
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:19,541
But this is surely not enough.
The story doesn't end here

212
00:17:20,101 --> 00:17:23,061
She'll have to go through
a lot more misery

213
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:26,541
The mother and her children will
go through a lot more of hell!

214
00:17:27,581 --> 00:17:31,141
Shakti. - Yes. - Are the fireworks
ready? - Yes, daddy

215
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,941
So what are you waiting
for? Burst them

216
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:43,021
What are you doing, Ma?
Are we all dead?

217
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:46,221
If you are true men, take
this gun and go there

218
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:48,421
Bring his dead body to me!

219
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:52,101
Lady! What madness is this?

220
00:17:52,301 --> 00:17:55,301
Yes! The Ladyship of
Anpara has gone mad!

221
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:58,901
She has killed Angarchand!
Say that in the court!

222
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:02,861
Don't just watch! Stop her!
- Ma... stop there!

223
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:06,941
Watch out! If anyone tries
to stop me, I'll kill him!

224
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:09,381
Wastrels! Don't get
anywhere close to me!

225
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:15,181
Stop it, Ma... - Give me the gun. -
Listen to me... Ma.

226
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:23,821
Get the car out.
- What are you doing Ma? Wait...

227
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:27,821
have you gone mad?
Calm down! Ma...

228
00:18:28,301 --> 00:18:30,301
Let me go! Leave me alone!
- Calm down, Ma...

229
00:18:30,381 --> 00:18:33,261
have you gone mad? Quiet! Quiet!

230
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:40,221
Ma... Get some water quickly!

231
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:47,261
Great! What bigger blow could we
have dealt to them than this one?

232
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:52,661
Thanks to this, the children of
this place can now live in peace

233
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:55,981
The children of this
family are already living in peace.

234
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:57,381
You doubt that?

235
00:18:57,461 --> 00:19:00,861
What sort of a life is this, sir?
Getting violent to help others...

236
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:04,901
resorting to bloodshed to humiliate
the family in Anpara...

237
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:07,701
what sort of a life is this?
What I'm getting at is...

238
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:11,341
they too now need to lead a
decent life too, isn't it?

239
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,421
No!
- I see!

240
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:16,581
So you're still against
the family in Anpara?

241
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,581
You must end this feud of 20 years...

242
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:22,861
...and put an end all the
bloodshed and violence

243
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:25,781
For how long will you keep
the fires of hatred alive?

244
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:30,741
The fires will live, lawyer! Do
you expect me to forget it all?

245
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:36,021
Even though the fires are dead,
the embers are still alive

246
00:19:37,061 --> 00:19:40,981
Must I really forget it all? And
how many things must I forget?

247
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:43,501
Tell me... tell me!

248
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:50,581
My Parvati... the goddess
of my family

249
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:56,901
Before my very eyes, she was here
at the altar in this courtyard

250
00:19:58,381 --> 00:20:02,541
And she finally breathed
her last in my arms

251
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:07,821
Must I forget that? I spent
14 years in prison

252
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:11,661
I endured the hardships of prison
life mentally and physically

253
00:20:12,581 --> 00:20:13,741
Must I forget it all?

254
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:19,541
You just said that my children
need to lead a peaceful life

255
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:24,741
But why isn't that the case? Why
hasn't Balram got married?

256
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:28,301
Why haven't Kishan and
Shakti got married yet?

257
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:35,021
After Jai, no child was
born in this family

258
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:42,301
I always yearned to see a cheerful
baby. Why? Tell me

259
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:46,861
Angarchand can never forget
all these things. Never

260
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:51,981
It isn't an iniury on my body.
It's a wound on my heart

261
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:57,781
My fires will be sated only when
that woman and her children are dead

262
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:06,221
If pain could be expressed, every
wound of mine would speak volumes

263
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,901
Shut up! First think of putting out
the fires that rage in my heart!

264
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,221
Only a widow knows the anguish
of losing her husband!

265
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:21,341
You lost your father, but I did
not concede defeat to Angara!

266
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:26,381
But today I realize that Angara's
sons are true men. And my sons...

267
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:30,061
are iackals that hide behind
their wives aprons! Jackals!

268
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:32,301
Yes, keep saying that
to them, lawyer

269
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:33,981
Where are you going, Roopa?

270
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:41,061
Wow! The birds and the bees!
That's the beauty of a woman!

271
00:21:41,941 --> 00:21:44,101
You see how they got drawn away?

272
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:49,981
Get this clearly! Only a woman can
create a rift in that family!

273
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:54,181
That there is no woman in their
lives happens to be their strength!

274
00:21:54,421 --> 00:21:58,101
If there were a woman
in Angara's family...

275
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:00,261
it would difficult
for them to handle.

276
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:02,941
All four would take
different paths...

277
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:08,036
and thus, they would be weakened.
You don't get it?

278
00:22:08,556 --> 00:22:13,716
We need a girl to destroy the
discipline of that family!

279
00:22:14,036 --> 00:22:16,156
You will then see...
- Shut up!

280
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:20,156
Cut the crap! You've
been barking away!

281
00:22:20,516 --> 00:22:23,716
My daughter's weeping because her
marriage has been called off

282
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,876
And this man is thinking about
getting those princes married!

283
00:22:28,156 --> 00:22:31,876
Are you going to kill the girl because
her marriage has been called off?

284
00:22:32,036 --> 00:22:36,276
She says she's not going to study.
- That's what she'll obviously say

285
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:40,036
But if she remains here, she'll
be even more miserable

286
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:44,116
So I suggest you ask her to
resume her studies again

287
00:22:44,356 --> 00:22:49,916
The latest! Sensational
news! All for free!

288
00:22:51,076 --> 00:22:53,996
Take it for free.
- How's it going? - Great guns!

289
00:22:55,596 --> 00:22:57,956
Where's the rest of the money?
- What money?

290
00:22:58,556 --> 00:23:01,796
This is not done! You never return
the balance to me ever!

291
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:03,876
Did I ever ask for
the balance from you?

292
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:05,916
When did you give me
any money at all?

293
00:23:06,196 --> 00:23:07,796
Don't screw up my mood.
I've got work to do

294
00:23:08,036 --> 00:23:11,076
Sensational news! For free!
Mind-blowing news! Take it.

295
00:23:13,156 --> 00:23:17,356
The village belle returns...

296
00:23:17,436 --> 00:23:22,476
she could not unite
with her beloved

297
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:26,596
He did not bring the bridal
fineries for her...

298
00:23:26,676 --> 00:23:33,156
so who is she going to find now?

299
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:39,396
Look at this babe!

300
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:42,076
Just ask, why's
she so worked up?

301
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:47,716
Just look, what a babe!

302
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:51,756
Just look, what a babe!

303
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:54,756
Just ask, why's
she so worked up?

304
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:57,836
Just look, what a babe!

305
00:24:01,276 --> 00:24:04,236
Why's she so arrogant? Why does
she fight with everyone?

306
00:24:04,436 --> 00:24:07,196
She seems to be a spirit!

307
00:24:44,356 --> 00:24:47,236
Her charm is a killer

308
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:50,436
Her eyes ooze oomph

309
00:24:50,796 --> 00:24:56,836
Lightning strikes my heart
when she sways in her gait

310
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,636
She makes everyone
at college pine...

311
00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:02,796
she won't let anyone get
their hands on her

312
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:08,956
She's a volcano waiting to erupt

313
00:25:09,036 --> 00:25:15,116
Fair-skinned, beautiful...
she's sure a nymph

314
00:25:15,316 --> 00:25:21,476
A blossoming beauty, she's
proud of her looks

315
00:25:21,756 --> 00:25:24,476
Tell her, friends...

316
00:25:24,836 --> 00:25:27,836
not to flaunt her airs

317
00:26:01,676 --> 00:26:04,676
Let's give her happy memories

318
00:26:04,836 --> 00:26:07,716
Let's find a prince for her

319
00:26:08,156 --> 00:26:10,796
The poor girl's grieving...

320
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:13,956
let's make her a bride

321
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:17,156
Why's she always on her own?

322
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:20,036
She's such an enigma

323
00:26:20,556 --> 00:26:26,156
Nobody knows what ails her

324
00:26:26,476 --> 00:26:32,516
Someone reason with her,
she's all pumped up

325
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:35,556
At this rate, she won't
find anyone...

326
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:38,596
she ought to get back to her senses

327
00:26:39,036 --> 00:26:44,916
The poor girl might end
up remaining a spinster

328
00:26:58,036 --> 00:27:01,836
I told you folks that I'm not
going back to that college!

329
00:27:02,196 --> 00:27:04,316
But you still thrust
me into that hell!

330
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:08,196
He humiliated me in front
of the whole college

331
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:11,636
I've lost all the
respect and honour!

332
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:14,916
Are you happy now?
- Who humiliated you?

333
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,076
Your Uncle has asked you a
question. Haven't you heard him?

334
00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:23,996
Who else could it be? It was
Angarchand's son, Jai!

335
00:27:25,196 --> 00:27:26,756
He had it published in a newspaper...

336
00:27:26,836 --> 00:27:28,516
...and distributed it
in the whole college

337
00:27:28,636 --> 00:27:30,556
Do you know what filthy things
they wrote about me?

338
00:27:31,356 --> 00:27:33,636
That scoundrel dares?! Brother,
Vir... let's go!

339
00:27:33,996 --> 00:27:36,716
Hari Singh, Deva... get your swords!

340
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:41,236
Get a dozen more men! After
we're through with him...

341
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:43,836
he'll never do a thing like this
ever again in his lifetime!

342
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:47,036
Where do you think you're going?
And what do you imagine?

343
00:27:47,476 --> 00:27:50,756
He'll be waiting for you...
to welcome you?

344
00:27:51,596 --> 00:27:55,756
Remember, you took a battalion last
time to fight over water rights

345
00:27:55,996 --> 00:27:58,116
And what happened? Four
of your men got killed...

346
00:27:58,436 --> 00:28:01,716
Seven were crippled,
four lost an eye...

347
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:03,556
and five were permanently blinded!

348
00:28:03,836 --> 00:28:05,716
We're still paying for
their livelihood!

349
00:28:05,836 --> 00:28:09,836
Bloody lawyer! You live off us and
lavish praise on that family?

350
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:12,356
We fought then for someone
else's water rights

351
00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:14,756
But it now has to do with
the honour of our family!

352
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:17,956
He'll have to pay for toying with
the honour of a girl from our family!

353
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:21,676
This is too much, Ma. We're now
going to return after beheading them!

354
00:28:21,836 --> 00:28:23,196
Let's go, brother.
- Wait

355
00:28:25,396 --> 00:28:27,476
I don't want you to do anything

356
00:28:27,796 --> 00:28:29,796
Can't you hear me? Go inside!

357
00:28:49,596 --> 00:28:51,076
There's no need to pamper me!

358
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,796
Grandma, I went to college because
I cared for your feelings

359
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:56,996
But when it came to my honour,
nobody here is bothered about it

360
00:28:57,276 --> 00:29:01,356
All the love just evaporated!
- Who said it evaporated?

361
00:29:01,996 --> 00:29:04,196
Now is when the love
will flow, my dear

362
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:08,996
Maybe I'm getting old, but I
haven't lost the spirit yet

363
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:11,756
Then why did you stop my
father and my uncles?

364
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:14,476
Why didn't you let them
battle it out? But no!

365
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:18,236
Your sons must come to no harm,
even if I'm burnt in the process!

366
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:21,036
What do I mean to you anyway?
Why must you bother?

367
00:29:21,516 --> 00:29:23,036
Have you gone mad?

368
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:26,876
Is that all you have got to know
of your grandma in so many years?

369
00:29:28,196 --> 00:29:31,596
The best attack is the one
that makes the least noise

370
00:29:32,276 --> 00:29:36,276
Listen, did he humiliate me or
your father or your uncles? No

371
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:40,756
He humiliated you. So you will
plot the course of your revenge

372
00:29:41,036 --> 00:29:46,076
You will fight for honour. How's
he to look at? Handsome?

373
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,196
Who?
- Angara's son?

374
00:29:50,516 --> 00:29:52,396
I don't know, I didn't
look carefully

375
00:29:52,636 --> 00:29:54,956
Then you must now take a good look

376
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:57,956
You will have to give him
a sense of belonging...

377
00:29:58,156 --> 00:30:01,916
and make him eat out of your
hands. Make him a pet

378
00:30:03,276 --> 00:30:06,036
You mean, I must fall
in love with him?

379
00:30:06,716 --> 00:30:10,596
Love? If you fall in love,
you're the first one I'll cremate!

380
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:13,396
There's a difference in what you
weigh and what you buy.

381
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:15,236
You have to just weigh.

382
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:18,556
You got to lay the trap
of everlasting love

383
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:21,836
Bring him to a position
where he licks your heels

384
00:30:22,436 --> 00:30:24,476
When he's madly in love with you...

385
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:27,516
...and revolts against
Angara and his family.

386
00:30:28,196 --> 00:30:30,396
And if you will say,
he'll even present...

387
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:32,316
...Angara's head to you on a platter

388
00:30:32,636 --> 00:30:35,996
And what love and what alliance?
It'll be the end of the story

389
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:38,396
He'll bang his head on
the walls all his life

390
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:43,676
Our revenge will be complete.
Then, I'll have my peace!

391
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,396
You get that, little girl?

392
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:01,876
Listen, where's Jai's room?

393
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:04,396
Upstairs. Room number 6.
Want me to call him?

394
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,836
No thanks. I'll find him on my own

395
00:31:07,556 --> 00:31:08,316
Hey, move.

396
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:09,756
Jai!

397
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:21,436
Jai! Wake up!
- Let me sleep!

398
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:23,996
That girl's coming here.
- Which girl?

399
00:31:24,956 --> 00:31:26,876
Anjali.
- Don't tell me!

400
00:31:26,956 --> 00:31:28,836
Yes!
- How did she get here?

401
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:30,636
How would I know? She is here.

402
00:31:30,796 --> 00:31:31,996
Give me my pyiama!
Where the heck is it?

403
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:33,996
I'm not your wife! - Give me
my pyjama! - Here, take this.

404
00:31:34,156 --> 00:31:36,476
You're on the bed, and your
pyjama's are on the floor!

405
00:31:36,716 --> 00:31:39,836
The girl! Keep her out!
- Hurry up and wear it!

406
00:31:42,956 --> 00:31:45,276
I want to talk to Jai.
- How come?

407
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:48,436
Jai... I need to talk in privacy

408
00:31:48,636 --> 00:31:51,356
No way! Say what you have
to in his presence!

409
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:55,276
This is between you and me.
Rather we talk in privacy

410
00:31:57,236 --> 00:31:58,516
Lucky!

411
00:32:01,116 --> 00:32:04,156
Can I come in and talk? - Not
necessary. Speak from where you are

412
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:09,756
But I'm not comfortable here.
- What're you doing, girl... watch it!

413
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:14,236
This place is only for men; so come
out and say whatever it is!

414
00:32:19,836 --> 00:32:25,156
I haven't come to stay anyway. But
I will say what I have come to say

415
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:30,556
What harm have I done to you, that
you're treating me like this?

416
00:32:31,436 --> 00:32:33,756
There is an enemity between
our families...

417
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:35,996
but must you seek revenge from me?

418
00:32:38,036 --> 00:32:40,156
My marriage was annulled
because of your father

419
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:44,476
But don't ruin my
studies now. Please

420
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:49,596
I request you... stop bothering me

421
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,716
Even if we're enemies...

422
00:32:53,476 --> 00:32:57,116
...when a girl cries before
you and asks for your help.

423
00:32:57,876 --> 00:33:02,196
And if you still bother her, it's
terribly shameful for a man

424
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:08,196
And I really believe that you're
the only man in your family...

425
00:33:09,516 --> 00:33:10,876
who will not disappoint me

426
00:33:16,796 --> 00:33:18,436
Go on... go inside

427
00:33:18,756 --> 00:33:22,236
She shouldn't have said that...
how could she say such a thing?

428
00:33:22,556 --> 00:33:24,796
What?
- She means you're the only man...

429
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:29,116
in your family, and the rest of
them are impotent, faggots...

430
00:33:29,276 --> 00:33:32,916
so they didn't get married!
- When did she say that?

431
00:33:33,036 --> 00:33:35,996
She said it to your face!
- And I didn't utter a word?

432
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:38,396
No!
- Did she say that?

433
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:43,036
Did she really? - Yes...
she did. - I'll show her!

434
00:33:48,716 --> 00:33:50,996
Hey girl... what did you say to me?

435
00:33:52,516 --> 00:33:54,316
That I'm the only real
man in the family, eh?

436
00:33:57,356 --> 00:34:00,236
Was I wrong? Aren't you a man?

437
00:34:00,676 --> 00:34:03,556
No!...I mean, I am!

438
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:08,396
Are the rest of my brothers impotent?
- Really? I just got to know

439
00:34:08,996 --> 00:34:10,556
Is that how things are?

440
00:34:11,636 --> 00:34:14,396
Poor brothers!
- Look, don't act too smart!

441
00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:16,636
Don't mess with Angarchand's
sons, okay?

442
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:22,556
You'll land in deep trouble!
They're lions... jackals, actually!

443
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:23,916
One second, one second...

444
00:34:24,516 --> 00:34:27,236
what names are you calling
your brothers, Jai?

445
00:34:28,036 --> 00:34:32,316
You call them lions, iackals...
is it a family or a zoo?

446
00:34:35,956 --> 00:34:38,276
Am I here in the nude? Get lost!

447
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:41,916
Who do you think you are?
The princess of Anpara?

448
00:34:42,316 --> 00:34:44,916
You're actually a
contagious disease!

449
00:34:45,436 --> 00:34:47,756
This son of Angarchand alone
is enough to deal with you!

450
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:52,156
I'll give you such a tough time,
I'm going to bother you so much...

451
00:34:53,196 --> 00:34:55,676
I'll do all I can! I
hate you! I hate you!

452
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:59,876
Have you said what you had to say?
- No! I...

453
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:04,556
Okay, I have... so?
- Very simple

454
00:35:05,276 --> 00:35:08,476
I'll love you just as
much as you hate me

455
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:13,516
Keep hissing like a cobra, and
I'll still try to charm you!

456
00:35:15,756 --> 00:35:19,196
Yes, I love Jai. With all my heart

457
00:35:19,356 --> 00:35:22,796
To hell with your heart! I'm not
going to let that happen! Never!

458
00:35:24,036 --> 00:35:26,396
Did you seek my permission
before starting to hate me?

459
00:35:26,756 --> 00:35:28,956
So what's the problem with
my love? It's my choice

460
00:35:29,476 --> 00:35:32,916
Keep your love to yourself
and... just get lost!

461
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:37,116
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I didn't ask you to love me in return

462
00:35:38,196 --> 00:35:41,116
Say it, then you'll know.
- I don't need to

463
00:35:41,316 --> 00:35:43,036
I love Jai! I love him, I love him!

464
00:35:43,196 --> 00:35:48,436
A hundred per cent! And nobody
has a copyright to love

465
00:35:49,036 --> 00:35:50,836
Was it your father who
gave birth to love?

466
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:52,956
I love you.

467
00:35:58,076 --> 00:36:00,836
What's going on here? Is this a
boxing ring for the two of you...

468
00:36:01,116 --> 00:36:05,116
to settle family scores? If you
want to continue studying here...

469
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:09,196
you must behave yourself. Else,
get out of this college

470
00:36:09,396 --> 00:36:12,836
I've told you, Madam.
It's not Jai's mistake

471
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:16,636
It's my fault. - There's no
need to say anything more

472
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:21,116
I've let you off on several
occasions without any punishment

473
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:27,236
And this was your last chance, but
you're saved because of this girl

474
00:36:27,356 --> 00:36:28,476
You will leave now.

475
00:36:30,596 --> 00:36:32,876
We could hear the commotion!
Who faced the music?

476
00:36:33,396 --> 00:36:35,396
What have you done, Anjali?

477
00:36:35,716 --> 00:36:37,836
This was your chance to have
him thrown out of the college

478
00:36:38,116 --> 00:36:42,596
Not yet. Let him stay for a while.
- What are you saying?

479
00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:45,756
What's the point in
plucking a raw fruit?

480
00:36:46,356 --> 00:36:49,436
Just see what Anjali does

481
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:52,276
Rahul...

482
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:28,716
What the hell are you doing?
Return my clothes to me!

483
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:54,436
What's love doing to me?

484
00:37:54,716 --> 00:37:55,716
Give my clothes!

485
00:37:55,916 --> 00:38:00,596
I'm losing my sleep, my
peace and my senses

486
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:01,716
Give my clothes, I say!

487
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:04,516
Don't go away from me...

488
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:07,476
come closer...

489
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:10,276
Don't go away from me...

490
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:12,436
come closer...

491
00:38:12,716 --> 00:38:18,396
what's love doing to me?

492
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:24,316
I'm losing my sleep, my
peace and my senses

493
00:38:54,276 --> 00:38:56,796
The earth reioices...

494
00:38:57,116 --> 00:38:59,916
the skies celebrate

495
00:39:00,116 --> 00:39:02,876
What place is this?

496
00:39:02,996 --> 00:39:05,836
Where have we landed?

497
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:08,276
The earth reioices...

498
00:39:08,716 --> 00:39:11,196
the skies celebrate

499
00:39:11,796 --> 00:39:14,436
What place is this?

500
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:17,276
Where have we landed?

501
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:23,636
It's the season of youth,
you and I are together...

502
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:28,276
there's mischief in the air

503
00:39:29,636 --> 00:39:35,356
Ours is such a lovely meeting...

504
00:39:35,436 --> 00:39:39,796
come into my arms

505
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:43,556
A yearning, a daze...

506
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:45,836
this is a huge kick

507
00:39:46,756 --> 00:39:52,396
What's love doing to me?

508
00:39:52,596 --> 00:40:00,756
I'm losing my sleep, my peace,
my sense of time

509
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:24,396
Tis such a splendid moment,
a cool breeze blows

510
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:30,316
Our hearts are skipping
a beat, there's an aching

511
00:40:30,476 --> 00:40:35,676
Tis such a splendid moment,
a cool breeze blows

512
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:41,596
Our hearts are skipping
a beat, there's an aching

513
00:40:42,516 --> 00:40:48,196
You are the one I desire, you
are the one I think of...

514
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:53,316
even if you don't realise it

515
00:40:54,156 --> 00:40:59,796
How will I tell you
about my state...

516
00:40:59,996 --> 00:41:04,916
you may never believe me

517
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,076
I yearn, you're blissfully
ignorant...

518
00:41:08,396 --> 00:41:10,556
I'm loving every moment of this

519
00:41:11,316 --> 00:41:15,276
What's love doing to me?

520
00:41:17,116 --> 00:41:21,996
I'm losing my sleep, my peace,
my sense of time

521
00:41:23,156 --> 00:41:25,756
I will be dead. She has started
to walk in my dreams even.

522
00:41:28,356 --> 00:41:30,156
What are you doing?
- I'm quitting college

523
00:41:30,316 --> 00:41:33,236
I can't stay here anymore.
That girl's gone crazy!

524
00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:35,196
You have no idea what she
has been doing to me!

525
00:41:35,316 --> 00:41:37,596
If my folks get to know,
they're going to kill me!

526
00:41:38,476 --> 00:41:40,476
You don't iump out of bed for
fear of the bedbug, do you?

527
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,236
If you're a real man, have the
girl thrown out of the college

528
00:41:44,756 --> 00:41:47,916
But she's been following me around!
I love you... she says!

529
00:41:47,996 --> 00:41:51,236
What can I do about a girl like
her? - Say I love you to her

530
00:41:52,836 --> 00:41:55,516
What? Me? I could
sock your face for that!

531
00:41:55,956 --> 00:41:58,076
Let alone fall in love,
Angarchand's sons don't...

532
00:41:58,156 --> 00:42:00,076
...even look at girls!
Remember this.

533
00:42:00,876 --> 00:42:02,396
To fall in love...

534
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:05,076
...Angarchand's sons need to be
born in another man's family

535
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:07,476
Yes, that'll take a
hell of a lot of time

536
00:42:08,756 --> 00:42:12,276
How could you say I must love her?
- When did I say you must love her?

537
00:42:12,356 --> 00:42:14,396
Don't! Don't ever!
- Then?

538
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:18,436
Pretense! A drama of love!
- What?

539
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:22,636
Don't you want those in Anpara to
go down on their knees to you?

540
00:42:23,276 --> 00:42:27,036
What?
- It's the girl who approached you!

541
00:42:27,436 --> 00:42:29,796
How can you let such a great
opportunity slip out of your hands?

542
00:42:30,316 --> 00:42:32,796
I'd advise you to trap her in a
web of love to such an extent...

543
00:42:32,996 --> 00:42:35,716
that there's no way out for her!

544
00:42:35,996 --> 00:42:39,956
After that, all of them will plead
and beg at your father's feet!

545
00:42:40,116 --> 00:42:44,636
Save our daughter's honour!
Please save her honour!

546
00:42:44,716 --> 00:42:48,196
Lmagine! The nemound respect
you'll command in your family!

547
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:49,756
Think! Imagine!

548
00:42:50,476 --> 00:42:52,876
Stop thinking! This
is time for action!

549
00:42:59,196 --> 00:43:01,796
Lmagine! You and your father
will have your revenge!

550
00:43:02,076 --> 00:43:05,676
Two birds with one stone! I
can feel the goose-pimples!

551
00:43:05,756 --> 00:43:06,796
I hope that will not
create any trouble.

552
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,356
Never mind, it'll get okay...
- Not this

553
00:43:09,516 --> 00:43:13,236
All this could create an uproar!
- But there ought to be an uproar!

554
00:43:13,476 --> 00:43:15,316
There'll be fun only if
there is an uproar!

555
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:29,036
Now go and tell her what I told
you. - But what have I to say?

556
00:43:29,196 --> 00:43:31,716
I'll bring a flower every
day to your hostel gate?

557
00:43:31,796 --> 00:43:36,756
No, not flower! Make
that a rose! Simple!

558
00:43:36,956 --> 00:43:39,316
It's not simple! You go
and say that to her

559
00:43:39,756 --> 00:43:41,916
Angarchand's not my father! You
want the revenge, don't you?

560
00:43:41,956 --> 00:43:44,116
Go and say it to her! Hurry up!

561
00:43:52,556 --> 00:43:53,996
Excuse me, Anjali.

562
00:43:57,156 --> 00:43:58,876
Could you come here
for a minute, please?

563
00:44:01,236 --> 00:44:02,796
Just a minute.

564
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:08,756
What is it?

565
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:14,716
I couldn't sleep all day.
- All day?

566
00:44:16,036 --> 00:44:20,956
No, I mean, all night. Sorry.
- I couldn't sleep all night either

567
00:44:21,956 --> 00:44:26,356
Really? Was it because of me?

568
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:32,436
No, I couldn't get sleep. There
were a lot of mosquitoes in my room

569
00:44:36,516 --> 00:44:40,556
It's your guts and sense of
humour that I really admire!

570
00:44:44,036 --> 00:44:45,356
My rose.

571
00:44:47,276 --> 00:44:48,156
Nothing.

572
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:51,476
Whether you believe me or not, I'm
telling you the truth today, Anjali

573
00:44:52,196 --> 00:44:55,116
No girl as beautiful as you has ever
told me that she's in love with me

574
00:44:55,596 --> 00:44:59,956
It's the first time such a thing
has happened to me. And it has...

575
00:45:00,756 --> 00:45:02,596
You hear drums?
- Yes, drums in my heart!

576
00:45:03,996 --> 00:45:07,516
And I thought, I ought to
share my feelings too

577
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:12,436
Anjali, I really like
you a lot. I love you

578
00:45:13,596 --> 00:45:15,676
It's the beginning of our romance.
- Listen...

579
00:45:16,716 --> 00:45:18,796
you can't say that and
get away so easily

580
00:45:21,676 --> 00:45:24,756
I need to be convinced that you
are the speaking the truth

581
00:45:25,596 --> 00:45:27,436
I need to make sure about
your feelings - Ok.

582
00:45:27,756 --> 00:45:31,716
Swear it on your mother that
whenever I call you...

583
00:45:31,836 --> 00:45:35,516
you will leave your
family and come to me

584
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:40,876
There's no hurry. Think twice. You
can let me know later, okay?

585
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:44,236
May I go now?

586
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:51,636
Take flower.

587
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:54,516
Let's go! She's bloody dangerous!
- But what happened?

588
00:45:54,676 --> 00:45:57,396
She pushed me against the wall.
- But what did she have to say?

589
00:45:57,476 --> 00:45:58,876
Say? She actually stung me!

590
00:45:59,596 --> 00:46:03,876
Whenever I call you, you must leave
your family and come over to me!

591
00:46:03,996 --> 00:46:06,476
I got to swear it on my
late mother! Am I crazy?

592
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:08,956
That's even better! Fantastic!
What's the problem with that?

593
00:46:09,116 --> 00:46:11,596
Your mother's dead, isn't she?
She's not going to die again

594
00:46:11,756 --> 00:46:15,876
She's not watching what you're
doing. Take it from me, it's a ploy!

595
00:46:16,116 --> 00:46:17,796
Be one-up on her! Use a ploy on her!

596
00:46:17,836 --> 00:46:19,716
Ask her to swear on her late mother!

597
00:46:19,836 --> 00:46:21,196
What are mothers for anyway?

598
00:46:21,356 --> 00:46:23,156
You swear on them when
they're dead, really!

599
00:46:23,316 --> 00:46:25,436
What if she takes an oath?
- Okay, you take the oath too

600
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:28,516
No way, I'm Angarchand's son.
I never go back on my word

601
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:30,956
A mere word! It's not the
Supreme Court's verdict!

602
00:46:31,196 --> 00:46:33,676
Call her before she calls you over!

603
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:34,996
When she leaves her
family and comes.

604
00:46:35,116 --> 00:46:37,996
Her entire family will bow
to you! What do you say?

605
00:46:40,916 --> 00:46:42,596
You're right.
- I knew it. Go on

606
00:46:44,396 --> 00:46:46,916
Excuse me Anjali, one second, please

607
00:46:52,796 --> 00:46:55,676
Have you made up your mind already?
You can take your own time

608
00:46:55,756 --> 00:46:58,356
No, I've thought about it
and even made up my mind

609
00:46:58,956 --> 00:47:02,636
You will also have to give me your
word. Swear it on your family

610
00:47:03,276 --> 00:47:07,876
What's the big deal? I swear
it on my family...

611
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:11,516
whenever you call me, I'll leave
all of them and come over to you

612
00:47:12,076 --> 00:47:15,596
Now you make the promise.
Give me your hand. Go on

613
00:47:45,276 --> 00:47:50,396
Slowly but surely, you're
the one who stole my heart

614
00:47:50,516 --> 00:47:54,716
And I didn't even get to know

615
00:47:55,596 --> 00:48:00,596
Quietly, secretly,
you cast a spell...

616
00:48:00,796 --> 00:48:04,596
and I didn't even get to know

617
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:10,236
We kept consenting
and disapproving...

618
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:15,436
secretly, we pined...

619
00:48:15,716 --> 00:48:20,836
and the things it all led to

620
00:48:31,396 --> 00:48:36,316
Slowly but surely, you're
the one who stole my heart

621
00:48:36,396 --> 00:48:41,076
And I didn't even get to know

622
00:49:02,556 --> 00:49:12,236
You are the one I dream
of every night

623
00:49:12,836 --> 00:49:21,996
It makes me sigh wistfully,
it leaves me restless

624
00:49:22,156 --> 00:49:27,156
I'm crazy about you...

625
00:49:27,236 --> 00:49:32,756
I wish I were the glass
you held to your lips...

626
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:37,196
you know not

627
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:53,236
Slowly but surely, you're
the one who stole my heart

628
00:49:53,476 --> 00:49:57,996
And I didn't even get to know

629
00:50:19,356 --> 00:50:24,076
At your side, in your arms...

630
00:50:24,436 --> 00:50:28,836
I always wish to be

631
00:50:29,796 --> 00:50:38,516
Pangs of separation I do not want
to suffer, even for a moment

632
00:50:38,796 --> 00:50:43,676
You are the one who possesses
my memories, my love

633
00:50:43,716 --> 00:50:49,596
Yours is the scent that
lingers on my breath

634
00:50:50,036 --> 00:50:54,556
You mean the life to me

635
00:51:26,756 --> 00:51:31,276
Uncle... there's nothing between us

636
00:51:33,276 --> 00:51:36,836
You're making a mistake. Come
on in, I'll explain...

637
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:38,876
Go and keep this inside first.
We'll talk later

638
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:43,076
Actually...
- I told you to keep it inside

639
00:51:43,156 --> 00:51:44,436
We'll talk later. Get going!

640
00:52:01,236 --> 00:52:02,476
What's on your mind?

641
00:52:02,996 --> 00:52:05,196
I don't tell beggars
what's on my mind

642
00:52:05,996 --> 00:52:09,516
Listen... if you mean well,
I will stand by you

643
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:12,436
I'll cut off the hands of those
who try to stand in your way

644
00:52:12,956 --> 00:52:15,556
But if you are trying to
settle family scores...

645
00:52:15,796 --> 00:52:18,476
I'll be the first one to pump
a bullet into your chest

646
00:52:20,116 --> 00:52:23,276
That's what I'm out to do. Hit
me, if you have the courage

647
00:52:23,796 --> 00:52:24,796
Damn you!

648
00:52:34,556 --> 00:52:37,556
Let go.

649
00:52:41,196 --> 00:52:43,236
What are you guys looking
at? Thrash him!

650
00:52:43,316 --> 00:52:45,156
No one interferes!

651
00:52:45,716 --> 00:52:47,836
This is between Angarchand
and the Anpara family!

652
00:52:48,436 --> 00:52:51,236
Just pick up the corpse
when one of us dies

653
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:54,436
Anjali! Anjali!

654
00:53:55,556 --> 00:53:56,476
What is it?

655
00:53:56,556 --> 00:53:59,196
Your Uncle and Jai are fighting
it out like mad dogs!

656
00:53:59,356 --> 00:54:01,716
Hurry up and come down. Else,
one of them's going to die!

657
00:54:09,036 --> 00:54:12,596
Jai. - Don't dare look at her
or I will kill you.

658
00:54:12,756 --> 00:54:13,476
Let go.

659
00:54:13,556 --> 00:54:18,716
My foot, you will kill me! Bring
your dead father back to kill me!

660
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:21,236
I'm going to kill you!
- Calm down, Uncle...

661
00:54:21,316 --> 00:54:25,076
You'll go home in pieces! Angarchand
will see the consequences!

662
00:54:25,316 --> 00:54:28,836
I swear, take him away if you don't
want him to see dead at my hands!

663
00:54:29,556 --> 00:54:30,676
Leave me alone!

664
00:54:31,036 --> 00:54:33,436
His folks will be happy
to see him alive!

665
00:54:33,636 --> 00:54:36,676
Let me go, Anjali! - I told you
there's nothing between us!

666
00:54:36,836 --> 00:54:39,716
So why did you get into the fight?
- What was it that I saw?

667
00:54:39,956 --> 00:54:42,396
I'm not blind!

668
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:47,196
What was all that?

669
00:54:48,676 --> 00:54:50,116
Speak! What was it?

670
00:54:51,676 --> 00:54:53,716
At grandma's behest, I...
- What?

671
00:54:55,396 --> 00:54:57,356
It was meant to create a rift
between Angara's sons

672
00:54:57,636 --> 00:55:00,796
I was just a puppet, Uncle. It's
grandma who holds the string

673
00:55:01,116 --> 00:55:02,516
God Almighty!

674
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:08,836
That old woman's out of her mind!
And you listen to her?

675
00:55:10,076 --> 00:55:12,676
What do you think Angara's sons are?

676
00:55:13,196 --> 00:55:16,516
If they get the slightest of doubt,
they'll kill the two of you!

677
00:55:16,676 --> 00:55:20,276
They'll bury you alive! The old
woman knows how powerful they are!

678
00:55:21,956 --> 00:55:25,556
Do you want to know the truth? With
a little change in your destiny...

679
00:55:25,636 --> 00:55:28,276
you'd have been born in
Angara's family, not ours

680
00:55:30,316 --> 00:55:32,956
Your mother was in love with
Angarchand's eldest son, Balram

681
00:55:33,276 --> 00:55:35,316
She even left her family
to marry him...

682
00:55:35,636 --> 00:55:37,316
but your grandma wouldn't
let it happen

683
00:55:38,876 --> 00:55:40,956
She had your mother forcibly
abducted from the wedding altar...

684
00:55:41,116 --> 00:55:42,916
and got her married to your
father.

685
00:55:43,796 --> 00:55:46,796
In the melee... your grandfather shot at Balram

686
00:55:47,476 --> 00:55:50,556
But the bullet struck Balram's
mother. Angarchand's wife

687
00:55:51,156 --> 00:55:55,156
She died. In retribution, he hacked
our father in broad daylight

688
00:55:55,876 --> 00:55:56,916
And all this happened only...

689
00:55:56,996 --> 00:55:58,356
...because of the stubbornness
of your grandmother!

690
00:55:58,676 --> 00:56:02,676
You now want the same kind of
bloodshed for yourself all over again?

691
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:14,076
I'm on neither side now

692
00:56:15,316 --> 00:56:19,836
But please don't tell everyone at
home about this and create a fuss

693
00:56:20,556 --> 00:56:23,876
What'll happen if I tell them?
They'll either give you a thrashing...

694
00:56:23,956 --> 00:56:25,716
or stop you from studying further.

695
00:56:25,956 --> 00:56:28,236
But guess what will happen... when his folks get to know?

696
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:31,316
There will be bloodshed

697
00:56:31,716 --> 00:56:34,036
lt'll all be over. Just
think about that

698
00:56:51,156 --> 00:56:53,316
Who was it that dared raise
his hand at our brother?

699
00:56:57,236 --> 00:56:59,156
Who dared to hit our brother Jai?

700
00:57:05,436 --> 00:57:08,556
That brawl you got into! Your
brothers got to know!

701
00:57:08,956 --> 00:57:11,316
They're out there, barking away!
- So now?

702
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:14,876
So indeed! You want to become
the hero of Anpara...

703
00:57:14,996 --> 00:57:18,596
and your brothers, the villains!
They'll bury you in this very bed!

704
00:57:18,676 --> 00:57:22,596
I saw the daggers in their hands!
They've come prepared for the kill!

705
00:57:22,756 --> 00:57:24,476
What are you talking? Have you told
them that I'm here?

706
00:57:24,556 --> 00:57:26,036
Am I crazy to say that?

707
00:57:26,116 --> 00:57:28,636
Go out there and tell
them that I'm not here!

708
00:57:28,756 --> 00:57:31,116
Are you mad? They'll clobber
me if I go down there!

709
00:57:31,316 --> 00:57:34,436
Your mad brothers bash up anyone
they can get their hands on!

710
00:57:34,596 --> 00:57:38,236
I'm running away now! That's it!
Run... for your lives! You too get lost.

711
00:57:38,316 --> 00:57:41,356
There are madmen out there!
Save your lives! Run!

712
00:57:41,516 --> 00:57:43,956
Who hit our brother?

713
00:57:44,636 --> 00:57:46,956
Who was it? Where's he hiding?

714
00:57:47,156 --> 00:57:48,676
Speak up, who hit my brother?

715
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,476
Speak up, or we'll carve you out!

716
00:57:50,601 --> 00:57:52,916
Get him! He's running away!
Must be there, that wretch.

717
00:58:00,316 --> 00:58:02,756
Stop. - Stop... where
are you running to?

718
00:58:04,156 --> 00:58:06,116
Who has kept the door open?

719
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:08,196
Stop there!

720
00:58:14,436 --> 00:58:15,916
Where the hell is he?

721
00:58:16,996 --> 00:58:21,476
These college boys are difficult
to catch nowadays

722
00:58:24,356 --> 00:58:25,156
Help!

723
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:31,956
Get him!

724
00:58:34,476 --> 00:58:36,396
Why did you hit my brother? Speak up.

725
00:58:36,636 --> 00:58:37,956
I did not. - Strong man, eh?

726
00:58:38,156 --> 00:58:40,596
You hit my brother?
- You dare hit my brother?

727
00:58:40,836 --> 00:58:43,516
Not me...
- Not you? So who was it?

728
00:58:43,596 --> 00:58:46,676
Brother! He hasn't done anything!
Leave him alone!

729
00:58:46,836 --> 00:58:49,196
Who hit you? Who?
- Speak up, who hit him?

730
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:52,876
I hit the man, he didn't hit me!
- Tell us his name!

731
00:58:54,556 --> 00:58:56,876
If I tell you, you'll go there
and raise a bloody storm

732
00:58:57,676 --> 00:58:58,876
Just give us the name

733
00:59:01,356 --> 00:59:02,116
The name!

734
00:59:03,996 --> 00:59:04,756
Veeru.

735
00:59:08,716 --> 00:59:11,636
Brothers, listen to me. Don't
go there... please!

736
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:14,596
Find him, he must
be around somewhere

737
00:59:15,436 --> 00:59:18,756
All right, go ahead! But kill
me before you kill him!

738
00:59:20,436 --> 00:59:22,956
What will people say if
you even touch Viru?

739
00:59:23,396 --> 00:59:24,916
That the elder brothers
had to rush...

740
00:59:25,076 --> 00:59:26,756
...to avenge their kid
brother's beating?

741
00:59:27,036 --> 00:59:31,236
I won't have any respect left!
Rather you kill me right now!

742
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:45,196
All right, if something of the sort
happens again, just hack him

743
00:59:45,596 --> 00:59:48,076
And feed him to the vultures so
that everybody gets to know...

744
00:59:48,476 --> 00:59:49,796
we're not cowardly men

745
00:59:54,076 --> 00:59:58,916
Go to iail for that if you have
to. Only real men go to jail

746
00:59:59,436 --> 01:00:01,156
But you mustn't spare him

747
01:00:13,653 --> 01:00:15,173
Is there something
you wanted to say?

748
01:00:18,373 --> 01:00:24,413
And without the boatman,
my heart trembles.

749
01:00:24,493 --> 01:00:27,893
You didn't want to ask why I got
into a fight with your uncle, did you?

750
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:34,373
It wasn't my mistake. He said I
shouldn't meet you, not love you...

751
01:00:35,533 --> 01:00:37,413
who the hell is he
to say that to me?

752
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:43,293
Even if the Gods order me...
I'm not deserting my love

753
01:00:46,613 --> 01:00:49,133
Jai. There was nothing of the
sort you imagined there was

754
01:00:50,853 --> 01:00:55,093
I'm not in love with you.
Whatever I said or did...

755
01:00:56,133 --> 01:00:57,293
was all a falsehood

756
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:03,773
My love and my sweet words were
meant to be a big deceit

757
01:01:05,053 --> 01:01:07,453
It was a game I started at the
behest of my grandmother...

758
01:01:07,933 --> 01:01:12,853
but I got to know that she was doing
it only to settle family scores

759
01:01:13,773 --> 01:01:18,013
I realised then, how disastrous
the consequences could be

760
01:01:19,533 --> 01:01:21,773
So I have decided to put
an end to this pretense

761
01:01:23,933 --> 01:01:27,733
Please, Jai... forgive me.
And also forget me

762
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:32,973
Hey, stop there...

763
01:01:34,853 --> 01:01:37,533
you're through with your story?
Now listen to my epic!

764
01:01:38,133 --> 01:01:40,813
Like hell you will lie to me! I was
the one who was deceiving you!

765
01:01:41,093 --> 01:01:42,533
At my friend Lucky's behest.

766
01:01:42,893 --> 01:01:45,453
To settle old scores and
so on and so forth!

767
01:01:46,013 --> 01:01:48,373
And what did you think? That
I've fallen in love with you?

768
01:01:48,653 --> 01:01:53,093
Are you crazy? Look at your face!
It's like a melon on a papaya tree!

769
01:01:56,373 --> 01:02:00,213
And listen... what else did you
say? That I must forget you?

770
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:02,693
I need to think of
you to forget you!

771
01:02:03,413 --> 01:02:07,093
Now get this into your
skull! I hate you!

772
01:02:07,813 --> 01:02:10,133
I hate you a thousand times more
than you can ever imagine!

773
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:13,693
A thousand times more! Good bye!

774
01:02:14,013 --> 01:02:16,253
The oar paddles across the waves...

775
01:02:17,493 --> 01:02:20,293
Without the boatman...

776
01:02:20,413 --> 01:02:25,373
...it causes an upheaval in my heart

777
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:31,653
Wake up!

778
01:03:31,893 --> 01:03:34,893
I've done nothing...
what are you doing?

779
01:03:34,973 --> 01:03:36,973
My sleep is ruined and
you're snoring away!

780
01:03:37,053 --> 01:03:40,813
I haven't driven your sleep away.
I'm not a girl. But constipation.

781
01:03:41,013 --> 01:03:43,373
Let me sleep in peace.
- It was your bloody idea!

782
01:03:43,893 --> 01:03:45,613
I was happily doing my own thing...

783
01:03:46,093 --> 01:03:48,253
and you stoked the fires
of love in my heart

784
01:03:48,573 --> 01:03:51,053
Now when the smoke is rising,
how can you keep snoring?

785
01:03:51,373 --> 01:03:55,333
But you told her that you're not in
love with her. End of the chapter!

786
01:03:55,413 --> 01:03:57,613
Shove the book under your
pillow and go to sleep!

787
01:03:58,213 --> 01:04:00,573
You want me to sing a lullaby
for you? In my guttural voice?

788
01:04:01,373 --> 01:04:04,253
Love isn't about throwing
a tenant out of your heart!

789
01:04:07,253 --> 01:04:09,653
Something's amiss?
- I can't get sleep

790
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:12,413
One minute, one minute...

791
01:04:14,373 --> 01:04:17,213
you mean, when you shut your
eyes, you see that girl!

792
01:04:18,053 --> 01:04:20,133
And when you open your eyes,
she disappears!

793
01:04:21,093 --> 01:04:22,373
Right?
- Yes!

794
01:04:22,573 --> 01:04:26,093
I know this disease very well.
It's a very dangerous ailment!

795
01:04:27,893 --> 01:04:31,293
You're a hopeless case. You're...

796
01:04:47,773 --> 01:04:50,133
What the hell are you doing?
- But why're you screaming?

797
01:04:50,293 --> 01:04:55,013
I screamed because you screamed.
And why did you scream? I was scared!

798
01:04:55,933 --> 01:05:00,053
I was wondering what would happen
when my brothers got to know...

799
01:05:00,373 --> 01:05:01,653
that I've fallen in love.

800
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:03,613
And you landed here just then!

801
01:05:04,053 --> 01:05:07,733
You're in love, why're you scared?
Raise the banner of revolt!

802
01:05:07,893 --> 01:05:11,293
Go and marry the girl, I say!
Take her away to Dubai... - Shut up!

803
01:05:12,733 --> 01:05:15,813
You talk any rubbish! One
can't decide these things in a hurry

804
01:05:16,053 --> 01:05:18,373
I'll have to think about
so many things

805
01:05:19,093 --> 01:05:22,533
So stand here and think about things.
I'll lie in bed... and think!

806
01:05:22,613 --> 01:05:23,413
Tally ho!

807
01:05:27,853 --> 01:05:30,493
Make sure you don't wake
me up when I'm thinking!

808
01:05:45,533 --> 01:05:49,373
You? At this hour? How did
you get into the hostel?

809
01:05:50,973 --> 01:05:55,453
I did my best... to hate
you. I really did

810
01:05:56,413 --> 01:05:59,773
But... I couldn't, I don't know why

811
01:06:01,853 --> 01:06:03,813
Did you also try?
- What?

812
01:06:04,813 --> 01:06:05,813
To hate me?

813
01:06:09,213 --> 01:06:11,493
I know, you tried.
And you also failed

814
01:06:13,973 --> 01:06:16,133
I don't think we can
ever hate each other

815
01:06:18,813 --> 01:06:21,373
So why don't we accept the truth?

816
01:06:23,413 --> 01:06:29,053
I know you're in love with me.
But I want to hear you say it

817
01:06:30,973 --> 01:06:32,813
It doesn't have to
be here and now...

818
01:06:35,493 --> 01:06:36,653
I'll come tomorrow

819
01:06:44,733 --> 01:06:50,653
Slowly but surely, you're
the one who stole my heart

820
01:06:50,813 --> 01:06:56,053
And I didn't even get to know

821
01:07:01,973 --> 01:07:05,533
What happened of her class?
I wanted to know about the same.

822
01:07:05,893 --> 01:07:08,333
But couldn't get any clue.

823
01:07:08,413 --> 01:07:10,493
Madam, can I meet Anjali Kashinath?

824
01:07:10,533 --> 01:07:12,933
But she has left
- Where to?

825
01:07:13,293 --> 01:07:15,613
Her folks came this morning.
They took her away

826
01:07:23,213 --> 01:07:24,053
Listen...

827
01:07:24,893 --> 01:07:28,173
Anjali has gone away deliberately
so that you don't meet her again

828
01:07:29,493 --> 01:07:32,053
She asked her folks to take
her away and just left

829
01:07:32,973 --> 01:07:36,933
She said that you mustn't
try to meet her ever again

830
01:07:37,493 --> 01:07:41,213
She could've said that to my face.
I wouldn't have swallowed her

831
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:44,533
I'm going to meet
her now at any cost

832
01:07:44,773 --> 01:07:47,613
Even if I have to go to Anpara.
- Anpara?

833
01:07:47,893 --> 01:07:48,733
Yes, Anpara

834
01:07:53,133 --> 01:07:55,613
You're right. You must go
and fight for your love

835
01:07:55,813 --> 01:07:57,573
You're going with me.
- You've gone mad!

836
01:07:57,693 --> 01:07:59,973
No way! You're going to set
a stack of hay on fire!

837
01:08:00,053 --> 01:08:01,133
Just come with me!

838
01:08:14,493 --> 01:08:17,693
That girl in red... The one there.

839
01:08:19,173 --> 01:08:20,453
With long tresses.

840
01:08:24,933 --> 01:08:26,013
What's this?

841
01:08:27,613 --> 01:08:30,053
Adhesive.
- So much?

842
01:08:30,813 --> 01:08:33,053
Must be for some painting
job. Why bother?

843
01:08:33,973 --> 01:08:35,933
What has adhesive to do
with a painting job?

844
01:08:36,773 --> 01:08:38,693
One more question and I'll
seal your lips with it!

845
01:08:39,253 --> 01:08:40,573
Letter, ma'am

846
01:08:43,573 --> 01:08:46,813
Looks like they're all upstairs.
Get me a ladder

847
01:08:48,733 --> 01:08:50,293
Come soon, just see what is written.

848
01:08:53,293 --> 01:08:56,653
Listen. If there's a
problem, just whistle!

849
01:08:56,893 --> 01:08:58,133
You know how to whistle?

850
01:08:59,413 --> 01:09:02,653
Shut up!
- I can inform your folks then!

851
01:09:02,933 --> 01:09:05,973
They're the ones who'll perform
your last rites, isn't it? Go on!

852
01:09:06,253 --> 01:09:08,453
Hold the ladder.
- Hurry up!

853
01:09:14,853 --> 01:09:17,893
Shut up, will you?
- What are you standing on?

854
01:09:18,533 --> 01:09:22,653
The ladder!
- Not the ladder. It's my hand!

855
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,133
I can't bear to see someone getting
beaten up... You better go.

856
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:31,693
Hmm. - What hmm. - I will die.

857
01:09:33,013 --> 01:09:34,693
What will I say, where I was.

858
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:36,293
Before you only...

859
01:09:49,093 --> 01:09:50,573
What happened?
- What happened?

860
01:09:52,853 --> 01:09:54,493
The scene... it scared me

861
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:57,893
But it's a comic situation.
Why must you be so scared?

862
01:09:58,893 --> 01:10:00,293
Well, it was a comic scene...

863
01:10:00,373 --> 01:10:04,653
but I bit into my finger
instead of the wafer

864
01:10:06,973 --> 01:10:09,533
Carnivorous girl... she
bites into fingers!

865
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:18,493
You... get the hell out of here! Go!

866
01:10:18,973 --> 01:10:21,533
Give me some wafers first.
- Here you are. Go!

867
01:10:22,853 --> 01:10:25,613
Now say that you love me.
- Shut up!

868
01:10:26,173 --> 01:10:28,133
All hell will break loose if
someone sees you! Go away!

869
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:31,373
I'm not leaving! First
say that you love me

870
01:10:31,573 --> 01:10:35,053
No, I don't!
- Lies, lies!

871
01:10:36,413 --> 01:10:38,213
In that case, you'd have
told me yesterday!

872
01:10:39,413 --> 01:10:41,093
You thought of professing
your love in the morning...

873
01:10:41,373 --> 01:10:42,533
...and then chickened out

874
01:10:43,293 --> 01:10:45,773
Look, I've taken the risk of
getting all the way here to see you

875
01:10:46,613 --> 01:10:51,333
Unless you tell me that you
love me, I'm not leaving!

876
01:11:03,853 --> 01:11:05,533
Someone is here. I had
seen it with my own eyes.

877
01:11:05,573 --> 01:11:07,773
What are you saying? Won't we come
to know of someone arriving?

878
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:10,173
We are the watchmen here.

879
01:11:10,693 --> 01:11:13,413
Don't trouble us.

880
01:11:13,453 --> 01:11:14,653
I'll wait in the storeroom.

881
01:11:14,813 --> 01:11:17,293
Unless you come and say I
love you, I'm not going!

882
01:11:17,853 --> 01:11:19,693
Whatever happens! Okay?

883
01:11:20,413 --> 01:11:22,733
It takes a good 3 hours
to go to the market...

884
01:11:22,813 --> 01:11:24,613
...to buy the goods and come back.

885
01:11:32,293 --> 01:11:34,613
I'm going to the storeroom!
- Have you gone mad?

886
01:11:34,853 --> 01:11:37,573
Both of us will get killed!
- No, no! I got to go!

887
01:11:37,733 --> 01:11:41,213
And... how am I going to kill time?
- Hide somewhere!

888
01:11:41,373 --> 01:11:43,693
If you're bored, catch the
movie playing up there!

889
01:11:46,413 --> 01:11:49,173
Please do not trouble.
How will we get out?

890
01:11:50,013 --> 01:11:53,693
Has Raia arrived?

891
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:56,133
I wanted to ask this
only. Is there any news?

892
01:11:56,613 --> 01:11:58,973
He told me that he would be here.

893
01:11:59,493 --> 01:12:00,053
What happened?

894
01:12:00,133 --> 01:12:02,173
It's nothing...
- Something wrong?

895
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:04,093
No, there's nothing.
- I'll take a look

896
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:06,333
No, where are you at fault?

897
01:12:06,813 --> 01:12:09,013
You remain busy in parties
and with your friends.

898
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:12,573
Who left that storeroom open?

899
01:12:13,293 --> 01:12:15,893
Is someone there?
- Yes, lady?

900
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:20,093
Lock that door. And
set the dogs loose

901
01:12:31,533 --> 01:12:35,213
So that no one can either enter...

902
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:40,013
...or go out of here.

903
01:12:41,533 --> 01:12:45,293
Imagine what would happen then

904
01:12:50,053 --> 01:12:51,853
Both of us...

905
01:12:52,413 --> 01:12:55,053
What happened?
- I don't know... nothing

906
01:12:55,293 --> 01:12:56,333
Something wrong?

907
01:13:03,093 --> 01:13:07,893
Why's that dog barking so much?
Look if there's a jackal in there!

908
01:13:08,093 --> 01:13:09,293
Take a look!

909
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,093
A family of dogs!

910
01:13:54,453 --> 01:13:56,853
Listen... there seems to be
someone behind those leaves

911
01:13:59,733 --> 01:14:01,933
Ghost!
- Get lost, soon.

912
01:14:07,933 --> 01:14:11,053
Over there! Get him!

913
01:14:11,133 --> 01:14:15,853
Freeze! Or I'll make
a sieve out of you!

914
01:14:15,933 --> 01:14:20,933
Scoundrel! Thief! You came to steal?
Is this your father's house?

915
01:14:24,933 --> 01:14:26,853
You came to steal the utensils?

916
01:14:27,013 --> 01:14:29,613
I wasn't here to steal, I swear!
My name is Lucky...

917
01:14:29,853 --> 01:14:32,053
I had come to take the
notebook in Anjali's class.

918
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:33,933
Notebook? You iump a wall for that?

919
01:14:34,013 --> 01:14:37,813
I didn't want to disturb you!
So I jumped over the wall!

920
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:42,693
Shut up! He's a real thief!
His eyes are like a frog's!

921
01:14:43,173 --> 01:14:46,213
That's how they've always been! The
whole family has eyes like mine!

922
01:14:46,533 --> 01:14:48,453
Don't let him go. Hand
him over to the police

923
01:14:48,533 --> 01:14:51,533
Call Anjali here. Then hand me
over to the police, the navy...

924
01:14:51,613 --> 01:14:53,253
Shut up... Anjali!

925
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:54,253
I'll be back

926
01:14:59,653 --> 01:15:02,253
What happened, daddy?
- Do you know this boy?

927
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:08,653
Lucky... roll number 32

928
01:15:08,973 --> 01:15:14,893
Yes, Lucky. My class-fellow.
- See? You believe me now?

929
01:15:15,733 --> 01:15:18,133
They were handing me over
to the cops! - What for?

930
01:15:18,653 --> 01:15:21,133
How would I know!
- What for, daddy? Why?

931
01:15:21,213 --> 01:15:23,253
It's nothing. Go to bed!

932
01:15:25,173 --> 01:15:28,173
May I go, Lucky?
- Sure, go on. Thank you

933
01:15:29,013 --> 01:15:32,493
I'd have been turned into an
adhesive! - Shut up and get going...

934
01:15:32,573 --> 01:15:34,093
or else you will be crushed.

935
01:15:51,733 --> 01:15:53,973
Come out, I am saying that.

936
01:16:03,493 --> 01:16:05,613
Stop. - Don't hit.
- Where are you going?

937
01:16:05,773 --> 01:16:07,933
Whom were you looking for?
- No one...

938
01:16:08,013 --> 01:16:10,813
I was only taking a leak.
- Right!

939
01:16:10,973 --> 01:16:13,613
I'll make you leak from everywhere!
- No!

940
01:16:15,413 --> 01:16:17,973
Anjali, I'm not leaving
unless you say it to me

941
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:21,773
Listen to me, please!
- Don't you want me to go away?

942
01:16:22,013 --> 01:16:23,853
Please go away before
someone lands here!

943
01:16:24,213 --> 01:16:26,853
Who did you come here with?
- No one, I swear

944
01:16:26,893 --> 01:16:27,933
Where's your buddy?

945
01:16:28,013 --> 01:16:30,413
Are you saying it or not?
- Jai, please!

946
01:16:30,973 --> 01:16:32,773
All right, I'm staying put then

947
01:16:33,253 --> 01:16:36,573
It's okay, it's all right...
- Very well, I'll say it!

948
01:16:40,173 --> 01:16:42,933
I have no friend at all!
- Where's that rascal Jai?

949
01:16:43,093 --> 01:16:44,933
I don't know any Jai!
- Watch out, frog!

950
01:16:45,013 --> 01:16:47,853
One punch, and you'll stick to
the wall like a lizard!

951
01:16:49,252 --> 01:16:54,172
I don't just love you, Jai...
you mean the life to me!

952
01:16:55,292 --> 01:16:58,172
You're my father's son-in-law and
my grandma's grandson-in-law. Okay?

953
01:16:58,932 --> 01:17:00,892
Is that enough?

954
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:12,932
What are you doing here?
- Nothing

955
01:17:13,372 --> 01:17:15,132
So go on inside... hurry

956
01:17:20,532 --> 01:17:23,492
You guys can fall in love, get
married, or even go to hell!

957
01:17:23,692 --> 01:17:26,772
But why must I keep getting beaten
up for you all the time?

958
01:17:27,132 --> 01:17:29,412
Who asked you to iump off that tree?

959
01:17:29,612 --> 01:17:32,212
I didn't! The branch gave
way and I fell down!

960
01:17:32,452 --> 01:17:35,292
Lucky for you, I fell down.
Or you'd have been caught...

961
01:17:35,372 --> 01:17:39,652
and they'd have given you such a
thrashing, you'd be thorn to shreds!

962
01:17:39,852 --> 01:17:42,332
You ought to be grateful
to me. Ungrateful man!

963
01:17:42,652 --> 01:17:45,372
Well, well! Have you ever
acknowledged my favours?

964
01:17:45,692 --> 01:17:49,052
What favours?
- You asked me to fall in love...

965
01:17:49,132 --> 01:17:50,372
and I did, didn't I?
- So?

966
01:17:50,892 --> 01:17:53,972
So what? When I took the risk of
falling in love at your behest...

967
01:17:54,372 --> 01:17:56,892
it's your responsibility to protect
our love. Remember that

968
01:17:57,212 --> 01:18:00,492
Which law says that? Take
a look at your father!

969
01:18:00,732 --> 01:18:03,932
Every female is allowed inside,
including bitches, asses and mares...

970
01:18:04,132 --> 01:18:08,852
but not womenfolk! Look in the
whole of India with a lamp...

971
01:18:09,052 --> 01:18:10,892
but you won't find a grumpy
old man like your father!

972
01:18:11,172 --> 01:18:14,732
And look at my father! He happily
died, three days after I was born

973
01:18:14,892 --> 01:18:17,332
And look at your old man!
He's sworn to life!

974
01:18:17,572 --> 01:18:18,892
He won't die and won't let die!

975
01:18:18,972 --> 01:18:20,812
And he swears
you to something crazy everyday!

976
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:27,372
If you really want to marry that
girl, there's only one way out

977
01:18:27,812 --> 01:18:32,292
Reform your brothers. Make
them cozy up to women

978
01:18:32,372 --> 01:18:35,812
If even one of them gets romantic
and gangs up with us...

979
01:18:36,172 --> 01:18:37,292
our iob will be done!

980
01:18:41,252 --> 01:18:46,332
Marriage for me? At this age?
Have you guys gone crazy?

981
01:18:47,052 --> 01:18:51,732
You're not as old as you think.
- Guys older than you get married

982
01:18:51,892 --> 01:18:55,772
Really?
- That's not what he means...

983
01:18:56,452 --> 01:19:00,572
Whatever my age, I can't get
married in this lifetime

984
01:19:01,532 --> 01:19:04,332
I once set out as a groom to get
married, but it didn't happen

985
01:19:05,092 --> 01:19:09,972
And I have no regrets. Nor do I
think I have taken a wrong step

986
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:14,172
But guess what I see whenever
I hear of a marriage?

987
01:19:15,532 --> 01:19:17,532
My mother's body,
wrapped in a shroud

988
01:19:18,492 --> 01:19:21,692
And our father, shackled and
being held by the police

989
01:19:24,532 --> 01:19:26,692
Do you want me to forget all
that and still get married?

990
01:19:27,212 --> 01:19:31,372
Sorry, brother. I didn't come
here to hurt your feelings

991
01:19:32,212 --> 01:19:34,332
Neither does he plan on
getting married, right?

992
01:19:35,572 --> 01:19:39,172
I spoke because I didn't want our
family to go without an heir.

993
01:19:39,657 --> 01:19:43,257
Without an heir? As if we're
the last of the dinosaurs...

994
01:19:43,297 --> 01:19:46,617
we face extinction and the world
won't get to see dinosaurs again!

995
01:19:46,937 --> 01:19:48,497
Go on... get the hell out of here!

996
01:19:49,697 --> 01:19:52,537
How dare you ask me to get married?
I'm a sworn celibate!

997
01:19:52,857 --> 01:19:57,537
I recite the Hanuman Chalisa
everyday. Forty times!

998
01:19:57,857 --> 01:20:01,497
I visit the shrine at Bairangpur
every month to pray...

999
01:20:01,577 --> 01:20:04,217
that the destruction called woman
does not ever come to possess...

1000
01:20:04,417 --> 01:20:06,497
...my heart and soul!

1001
01:20:07,697 --> 01:20:10,857
And you want me to pray
for saris and blouses?

1002
01:20:11,217 --> 01:20:13,777
What will the Lord say? That
I've let Him down?

1003
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:15,857
I'm going to kill you!

1004
01:20:16,177 --> 01:20:18,137
What are you doing?
- I'm wringing his neck!

1005
01:20:18,217 --> 01:20:22,937
Leave him alone, please! - Who the
hell are you to stop me? Who?

1006
01:20:23,017 --> 01:20:26,257
I'm his close friend!
- Close friend? You beggar!

1007
01:20:26,537 --> 01:20:32,857
Before I end his story, get the
hell out of here! Out you go!

1008
01:20:33,617 --> 01:20:37,177
Hail Bairangbali! The
Lord of Celibacy!

1009
01:20:43,537 --> 01:20:45,297
That's the wrestler.

1010
01:20:46,977 --> 01:20:48,777
Don't stand around to talk to him

1011
01:20:49,697 --> 01:20:51,857
If he asks, say we're here for
Lord Hanuman's oblations

1012
01:20:54,177 --> 01:20:57,777
Don't look at him...
- Hey... come here

1013
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:10,497
You insist that we guys
ought to marry, isn't it?

1014
01:21:11,177 --> 01:21:13,857
Six years ago, this is exactly what
I was pestering my brothers with

1015
01:21:14,217 --> 01:21:16,337
For how long would they get off
both the sides of the bed?

1016
01:21:16,657 --> 01:21:18,137
And remember what dad said then?

1017
01:21:18,817 --> 01:21:20,977
Your brothers have decided... they are not getting married.

1018
01:21:21,177 --> 01:21:22,657
So why do you want to get married?

1019
01:21:23,137 --> 01:21:26,377
That's it. I decided
to do my own laundry.

1020
01:21:27,057 --> 01:21:28,377
But I'd never get married

1021
01:21:28,857 --> 01:21:30,977
And nor will I let anyone
in this family get married

1022
01:21:31,377 --> 01:21:33,297
Which means none of them
is going to lay an egg

1023
01:21:33,537 --> 01:21:37,177
What?
- I was talking about poultry...

1024
01:21:37,257 --> 01:21:39,537
Come in... you come here!

1025
01:21:44,017 --> 01:21:45,817
Look Murky...
- Lucky

1026
01:21:45,977 --> 01:21:49,537
Whoever you are, it's your company
that has done this to my brother

1027
01:21:50,257 --> 01:21:53,577
Look at me! If I see you with
my brother ever again...

1028
01:21:54,257 --> 01:21:56,497
I'm going to wreck your knee-caps

1029
01:22:06,137 --> 01:22:07,937
C'mon... come here!

1030
01:22:09,817 --> 01:22:13,857
Get some rat-poison and
feed it to these guys!

1031
01:22:14,297 --> 01:22:15,457
Kill the silly asses!

1032
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:18,697
So long as your brothers live,
you can never get married!

1033
01:22:18,937 --> 01:22:21,577
Not you alone, they won't
even let me get married!

1034
01:22:22,377 --> 01:22:24,417
This is the end of your friendship.
We go our ways

1035
01:22:24,617 --> 01:22:26,017
Hey Lucky...
- Forget it

1036
01:22:26,217 --> 01:22:28,817
Where are you going?
Listen to me!

1037
01:22:35,457 --> 01:22:38,297
I know our union could bring
about an earthquake

1038
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:44,617
But I'm not afraid. To be honest,
I just don't care

1039
01:22:46,377 --> 01:22:49,177
You have no idea how my
father brought me up

1040
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:53,017
I was only five when my mother died

1041
01:22:55,777 --> 01:22:58,817
But my father and my brothers never
let me feel the lack of a mother

1042
01:23:02,537 --> 01:23:06,737
And yet, I'm willing to leave
all of them for your sake

1043
01:23:07,617 --> 01:23:11,137
Should I call you, will
you come to me?

1044
01:23:13,577 --> 01:23:14,857
Try me out

1045
01:23:20,897 --> 01:23:22,857
You will never leave me, will you?

1046
01:23:28,097 --> 01:23:28,857
What?

1047
01:23:33,457 --> 01:23:34,337
Come here

1048
01:23:39,417 --> 01:23:41,217
Don't be scared. I'm with you

1049
01:23:42,257 --> 01:23:43,737
Don't yell! I'm coming

1050
01:23:45,417 --> 01:23:46,977
I asked you to come here

1051
01:23:56,977 --> 01:23:58,697
You've turned out
to be a smart girl!

1052
01:23:59,537 --> 01:24:01,377
So the fish has taken the bait!

1053
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:04,977
You are now truly grandma's girl!

1054
01:24:06,217 --> 01:24:10,537
He will behead Angarchand if
you ask him to... won't he?

1055
01:24:10,857 --> 01:24:14,297
He will, won't he? He's
crazy about you, right?

1056
01:24:14,617 --> 01:24:16,137
Yes...
- Yes!

1057
01:24:17,537 --> 01:24:21,017
I'll tell you what step you
must now take. Come with me

1058
01:24:21,737 --> 01:24:25,017
Jai! You have it made! Your
wedding band's on its way!

1059
01:24:27,057 --> 01:24:28,897
Jai, you have it made!

1060
01:24:28,977 --> 01:24:32,017
You can love anyone you want
to, and even get married!

1061
01:24:32,177 --> 01:24:36,337
Your rotten father and brothers
can't do a thing to you!

1062
01:24:36,617 --> 01:24:40,617
Who was it who got most worked up
when we suggested marriage to them?

1063
01:24:40,857 --> 01:24:44,297
Your brother Kishan! He can't open
his mouth before us anymore!

1064
01:24:44,377 --> 01:24:46,817
The so-called celibate!
- What's all this about?

1065
01:24:47,257 --> 01:24:50,137
Where does this brother of yours go
every Saturday and Sunday?

1066
01:24:51,257 --> 01:24:53,137
Bairangpur. Lord Hanuman's temple.
- No!

1067
01:24:53,497 --> 01:24:55,497
He goes not to Lord
Hanuman's temple!

1068
01:24:55,697 --> 01:24:57,337
He goes to Gangapur to meet someone!

1069
01:24:57,457 --> 01:24:59,377
Who?
- His wife!

1070
01:24:59,617 --> 01:25:02,137
He's been married for seven years
and even has two children!

1071
01:25:02,337 --> 01:25:04,257
He has kept them in hiding

1072
01:25:05,817 --> 01:25:07,257
You're talking about my
brother Kishan, right?

1073
01:25:07,337 --> 01:25:09,777
And he's no celibate, he's
the playFul Lord Krishna!

1074
01:25:09,977 --> 01:25:12,017
He goes not to the Lord's
temple at Bajrangpur

1075
01:25:12,217 --> 01:25:14,497
He goes to meet his wife. Gopi.

1076
01:25:14,697 --> 01:25:16,097
Who happens to be a
teacher in Gangapur

1077
01:25:16,537 --> 01:25:21,097
Lucky, if you're spinning a yarn,
you're really unlucky, I warn you!

1078
01:25:21,177 --> 01:25:24,417
I knew you wouldn't believe me!
I knew it... I have solid proof!

1079
01:25:25,857 --> 01:25:26,817
Look at this!

1080
01:25:32,577 --> 01:25:35,937
This is your brother Kishan. And
he's definitely not a celibate!

1081
01:25:39,377 --> 01:25:40,177
Moron!

1082
01:25:40,697 --> 01:25:43,297
This is the first sensible thing
you've done in your lifetime!

1083
01:25:44,137 --> 01:25:47,897
Wow! Brother Kishan!
What a smart game!

1084
01:25:59,151 --> 01:26:00,794
Here, Gangapur has arrived.

1085
01:26:04,511 --> 01:26:05,751
Let's ask there.

1086
01:26:09,471 --> 01:26:11,911
Does a school teacher
called Gopi live here?

1087
01:26:12,151 --> 01:26:13,591
School teacher?
- Yes

1088
01:26:13,871 --> 01:26:16,711
No. There is a lady called
Gopi who lives nearby

1089
01:26:17,271 --> 01:26:20,231
But she's not a school teacher.
- Is her husband's name Kishan?

1090
01:26:20,431 --> 01:26:25,991
No. Her husband's name is Murari.
- Murari? It's someone else

1091
01:26:26,511 --> 01:26:28,951
You always listen to some
drivel and drive me berserk

1092
01:26:29,071 --> 01:26:30,911
Let's go now...
- Hang on... one moment

1093
01:26:33,031 --> 01:26:34,231
Is this Murari?

1094
01:26:34,951 --> 01:26:36,631
Right. This is Murari indeed

1095
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:39,111
And his wife's name is Gopi?
- Yes

1096
01:26:39,591 --> 01:26:44,511
But she's not a school teacher.
She trains children in dancing

1097
01:26:45,071 --> 01:26:46,831
One, two...

1098
01:26:47,431 --> 01:26:49,551
One, two, three, four...

1099
01:26:49,591 --> 01:26:53,551
One, two... One two, three, four...

1100
01:26:54,151 --> 01:26:55,951
Who is it?
- Before brother can arrive...

1101
01:26:55,991 --> 01:26:57,991
we'll produce her before father.
- Right!

1102
01:26:59,231 --> 01:27:00,191
Who is it?

1103
01:27:02,711 --> 01:27:05,591
Who?
- Sister-in-law!

1104
01:27:05,671 --> 01:27:07,351
Get up! Who are you?

1105
01:27:07,511 --> 01:27:10,311
This is your brother-in-law! Jai!
- Jai who?

1106
01:27:10,551 --> 01:27:14,391
Me... Hail sister-in-law!
- Sister-in-law? Who?

1107
01:27:14,551 --> 01:27:17,191
Aren't you brother Kishan's wife?
- Kishan?

1108
01:27:17,511 --> 01:27:20,311
No, I'm not Kishan's wife.
I'm Murari's wife

1109
01:27:20,511 --> 01:27:21,471
It's one and the same thing!

1110
01:27:21,751 --> 01:27:24,471
I'm sorry, your husband's name
is not Murari, it's Kishan

1111
01:27:24,591 --> 01:27:27,351
And I'm his younger brother Jai.
Where are the children?

1112
01:27:27,551 --> 01:27:29,231
I haven't seen them, but
they must be very cute!

1113
01:27:29,351 --> 01:27:34,191
Listen... where are you going?
- Children! I'm your Uncle!

1114
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:38,711
Call me Uncle, please.
- Uncle!

1115
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:42,271
Quiet! They're not my children.
They're here to learn dance

1116
01:27:42,391 --> 01:27:45,391
Set that child down... go on!
And get going... get out!

1117
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:47,511
What are you doing, sis-in-law?
- I'm not your sister-in-law!

1118
01:27:47,711 --> 01:27:49,951
It's no good, sis-in-law.
The cat is out of the bag!

1119
01:27:50,191 --> 01:27:52,831
Kishan has told Angarchand the
truth!

1120
01:27:53,511 --> 01:27:55,551
I don't know any Angar...

1121
01:27:55,591 --> 01:27:58,831
nor am I any Kishan's wife.
Get going... get lost!

1122
01:28:00,671 --> 01:28:01,751
Sister-in-law!

1123
01:28:05,111 --> 01:28:08,751
Let me tell her the truth!
- All hell will break loose, Jai!

1124
01:28:08,831 --> 01:28:11,231
Lt'll be worse if I don't tell her

1125
01:28:11,551 --> 01:28:14,711
My poor brother won't get to see
his wife and children before dying

1126
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:16,991
Speak softly... she might listen!
What are you doing?

1127
01:28:18,631 --> 01:28:21,071
What's the matter?
- Nothing, let's go

1128
01:28:21,231 --> 01:28:22,551
Something surely is...
- Nothing...

1129
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:27,951
What were you saying? Tell me!
- Go on. Tell her

1130
01:28:29,791 --> 01:28:32,311
Sister-in-law, I'm sorry, I don't
have the permission to tell you

1131
01:28:33,231 --> 01:28:34,671
But there's no other way now

1132
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:42,751
My brother has met with an
accident! - What happened to him?

1133
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:45,631
He broke a bone in his tummy
- There are no bones in the tummy!

1134
01:28:45,711 --> 01:28:47,551
I mean, his legs are broken.

1135
01:28:47,631 --> 01:28:50,991
And he badly wants to see
his wife and children

1136
01:28:51,711 --> 01:28:54,871
I'll be back in a moment.
Don't go away!

1137
01:29:02,471 --> 01:29:04,111
Ok, bye.

1138
01:29:05,551 --> 01:29:07,311
Sir...
- Yes?

1139
01:29:07,591 --> 01:29:09,791
Is your name Kishan?
- Yes... who told you?

1140
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:14,911
Where did you meet Kishan? Not
Kishan! My name is Murari!

1141
01:29:15,191 --> 01:29:17,271
You know my name, don't
you? Murari... okay?

1142
01:29:18,391 --> 01:29:21,311
I told them, but they
wouldn't believe me

1143
01:29:21,391 --> 01:29:23,151
Who wouldn't believe you?
- Brother

1144
01:29:23,711 --> 01:29:25,551
Whose brother?
- Your brother

1145
01:29:25,871 --> 01:29:30,431
My brother? - There was also
a toad of a guy with him

1146
01:29:31,191 --> 01:29:34,191
A toad of a guy... did
he wear this ear-ring?

1147
01:29:34,271 --> 01:29:35,991
Yes.
- Damn it!

1148
01:29:36,431 --> 01:29:39,591
Where did they go? - I showed
them the way to your house

1149
01:29:39,871 --> 01:29:44,511
What? My house?
- Yes. A right, left... and straight

1150
01:29:44,911 --> 01:29:48,271
My house... what harm
had I done to you?

1151
01:29:48,351 --> 01:29:50,071
I'll pull your guts out!

1152
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:52,831
Why're you angry with me?
- Angry?

1153
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:56,271
Did I ever tease your sister? Did
I misbehave with your mother?

1154
01:29:56,631 --> 01:29:58,991
Rotten scoundrel! Damn you!

1155
01:30:09,751 --> 01:30:11,391
Hurry up children...

1156
01:30:22,151 --> 01:30:24,111
Thank God you're all right

1157
01:30:24,911 --> 01:30:26,831
And they said you had
met with an accident

1158
01:30:27,231 --> 01:30:31,471
That you had broken limbs!
- What can be worse than this?

1159
01:30:32,191 --> 01:30:34,671
You've fallen in the hands
of these wastrels!

1160
01:30:36,231 --> 01:30:39,271
You boys ought to be ashamed! He's
right here, hale and hearty...

1161
01:30:39,431 --> 01:30:41,151
...and you said he had
had an accident!

1162
01:30:41,431 --> 01:30:43,311
May the worms get your tongue!

1163
01:30:44,031 --> 01:30:48,191
Dogs! Are you going to be happy
after ruining my family?

1164
01:30:48,671 --> 01:30:51,311
Fantastic! You're married
and having all the fun

1165
01:30:51,391 --> 01:30:53,871
And how about us? Have you
ever given a thought to us?

1166
01:30:54,711 --> 01:30:56,831
Let's go, Lucky. Let's
bring dad here!

1167
01:30:57,111 --> 01:30:58,351
And then we will see whether
this marriage happens or not.

1168
01:30:58,431 --> 01:31:00,031
Stop him, Gopi... stop him!

1169
01:31:00,111 --> 01:31:03,551
Brother-in-law, please stop...
- Don't stop me, sister-in-law

1170
01:31:03,711 --> 01:31:05,591
We're not staying here,
no matter what happens

1171
01:31:06,111 --> 01:31:08,911
Brother, say whatever you have
to only to father, okay?

1172
01:31:08,991 --> 01:31:12,671
You're my father's last mistake!
Have mercy on me... please!

1173
01:31:13,071 --> 01:31:15,951
You want to get married, don't you?
I'll get you married, okay?

1174
01:31:16,111 --> 01:31:19,151
Gopi... - A sister-in-law is
like a mother. How could you?

1175
01:31:19,231 --> 01:31:21,751
Dumbo! Not her!

1176
01:31:21,911 --> 01:31:24,631
I'll get you married to anyone
else you want, okay?

1177
01:31:24,671 --> 01:31:26,431
Not I but he wants to get married.

1178
01:31:26,991 --> 01:31:29,671
Whoever you say, blind
or crippled...

1179
01:31:29,871 --> 01:31:31,631
I'll get you married to
her, okay? I swear!

1180
01:31:32,351 --> 01:31:33,511
Really?
- Of course

1181
01:31:34,511 --> 01:31:37,871
You won't back out, will you?
- You don't trust my word?

1182
01:31:38,271 --> 01:31:39,151
One moment...

1183
01:31:40,831 --> 01:31:42,951
I swear it on my children.

1184
01:31:43,471 --> 01:31:46,791
I'll get you married to
the girl of your choice

1185
01:31:47,391 --> 01:31:50,191
Why're you hollering away? It's
enough that your father's crying!

1186
01:31:51,791 --> 01:31:52,631
Okay?

1187
01:31:53,151 --> 01:31:56,551
In that case... there's this
girl I'm in love with

1188
01:31:56,871 --> 01:32:01,591
What girl? I'd get you married
even to a tigress!

1189
01:32:01,991 --> 01:32:05,271
Who is she?
- She's very much there but...

1190
01:32:07,311 --> 01:32:08,951
Go on.
- She's from Anpara village

1191
01:32:10,831 --> 01:32:12,591
Grand-daughter of Laxmi Devi. Anjali

1192
01:32:16,191 --> 01:32:18,551
You promised me! You gave
me your word, brother!

1193
01:32:18,711 --> 01:32:21,591
No promise! It's all over!

1194
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:25,791
And what are you watching?
Take the kids inside!

1195
01:32:26,031 --> 01:32:29,511
Laxmi Devi's family, eh? You're
playing games with me?

1196
01:32:29,791 --> 01:32:32,231
Find another girl! This marriage
is not taking place!

1197
01:32:32,591 --> 01:32:35,791
You want me to get you married, so
my kids will find another father?

1198
01:32:35,951 --> 01:32:40,071
Get lost!
- I must bring daddy here!

1199
01:32:40,111 --> 01:32:44,591
Listen... why do you keep dragging
dad into this mess?

1200
01:32:44,871 --> 01:32:47,031
Can't you let me breathe easily?

1201
01:32:47,271 --> 01:32:50,911
Couldn't you find another girl,
except this female ghost?

1202
01:32:51,111 --> 01:32:53,871
Are you or are you not
standing with me?

1203
01:32:53,951 --> 01:32:56,951
I'm not lying down now, am I?
But let me tell you...

1204
01:32:57,991 --> 01:33:02,191
if anyone except you, I and this
rat gets to know about this...

1205
01:33:02,271 --> 01:33:04,071
...marriage, I'll.

1206
01:33:04,151 --> 01:33:07,511
Will it cause trouble?
- Trouble?

1207
01:33:07,751 --> 01:33:11,191
I'll bust your eyeballs!
- Don't tell me!

1208
01:33:12,871 --> 01:33:14,551
We're headed for trouble.
- What happened?

1209
01:33:16,231 --> 01:33:18,071
Step aside... come

1210
01:33:19,071 --> 01:33:21,511
How was I to know that the two of
you would reach a compromise?

1211
01:33:21,791 --> 01:33:25,311
I told Shakti that Kishan
is already married

1212
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:28,391
What? You told Shakti?

1213
01:33:28,671 --> 01:33:31,391
Moron! By now Dad must
have got to know!

1214
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:38,911
Brother? - His eyes are open.
He could be alive.

1215
01:33:39,231 --> 01:33:40,751
Sister-in-law! Fetch some water!

1216
01:33:53,271 --> 01:33:54,551
Is it true?

1217
01:33:54,831 --> 01:33:57,031
From what I gather

1218
01:33:58,031 --> 01:34:01,271
You've tossed a live fish on
the burning sands, Shakti

1219
01:34:02,071 --> 01:34:04,751
If there is even an iota of
truth in what you say...

1220
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:08,471
only three sons of Angarchand
will remain alive

1221
01:34:09,031 --> 01:34:11,951
I'll hack Kishan to pieces and
feed him to the vultures

1222
01:34:12,711 --> 01:34:14,511
And if what you say proves
to be untrue...

1223
01:34:15,231 --> 01:34:17,791
Angarchand will still have
only three sons alive

1224
01:34:18,671 --> 01:34:20,311
I'll give you the same treatment

1225
01:34:20,591 --> 01:34:23,831
I'm worse off than a badly who has
a scorpion crawling on his head!

1226
01:34:23,951 --> 01:34:26,551
Gopi, stuff the kids
in a bag. Let's go!

1227
01:34:26,991 --> 01:34:30,231
Shakti could get here with dad
and elder brother any moment

1228
01:34:30,591 --> 01:34:32,951
And when's that ass arriving
with the taxi?

1229
01:34:33,111 --> 01:34:35,511
If the taxi doesn't arrive
on time, we'll all be sunk!

1230
01:34:35,951 --> 01:34:37,831
Don't worry, brother. Everything
will be all right

1231
01:34:38,031 --> 01:34:39,391
Shut up!

1232
01:34:39,881 --> 01:34:42,641
I'm sitting on a frying pan and
you ask me not to squirm...?

1233
01:34:42,881 --> 01:34:43,641
Hurry up!

1234
01:34:43,881 --> 01:34:45,681
All this has happened
because of you!

1235
01:34:45,761 --> 01:34:49,001
Let me just get into another house,
then I'll turn on the music for you!

1236
01:34:49,081 --> 01:34:51,881
You're doing nothing to help!
Stop shouting now!

1237
01:34:52,041 --> 01:34:54,321
Hurry up, else we're all
going to be cremated!

1238
01:34:54,681 --> 01:34:59,081
The cab has arrived!
Hurry up! O God!

1239
01:35:00,281 --> 01:35:02,601
What's that in your hand?
- I made some sweetmeat

1240
01:35:02,681 --> 01:35:05,961
Sweetmeat? You mother...
- What are you saying?

1241
01:35:06,041 --> 01:35:10,681
I'm being stripped and you're
making sweets! Dump it!

1242
01:35:10,801 --> 01:35:12,601
Will you distribute sweets
at a time like this?

1243
01:35:18,841 --> 01:35:20,681
Why've you left all this here?

1244
01:35:30,841 --> 01:35:31,521
Gopi...

1245
01:35:31,801 --> 01:35:34,321
Gopi! Go on inside! Go!

1246
01:35:44,841 --> 01:35:45,721
Father?

1247
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:48,641
Back... we're going back! Hurry!

1248
01:35:52,241 --> 01:35:53,801
God! Gopi...

1249
01:36:06,401 --> 01:36:07,601
Who are you?

1250
01:36:08,081 --> 01:36:11,521
I was going out to do something
important and...

1251
01:36:12,441 --> 01:36:14,561
I'm a strong believer
in auspicious timing.

1252
01:36:14,641 --> 01:36:16,081
I'm in a bit of a hurry

1253
01:36:17,081 --> 01:36:20,961
Have we met before? Who
is this elderly gentleman?

1254
01:36:21,801 --> 01:36:24,521
So you want me to tell you his name?

1255
01:36:24,721 --> 01:36:28,601
I only asked his name... why're
you gritting your teeth?

1256
01:36:28,721 --> 01:36:30,441
Is it a difficult name?

1257
01:36:30,521 --> 01:36:33,001
So you've forgotten
father and brother?

1258
01:36:33,761 --> 01:36:39,081
I see! So he's your father and
you're his son! Very nice!

1259
01:36:39,361 --> 01:36:42,041
But why're you creating
a fuss out here?

1260
01:36:43,401 --> 01:36:47,961
Worthless chap! Do you remember
now or do you want another slap?

1261
01:36:48,801 --> 01:36:52,081
One more slap may remind
you that you are Kishan!

1262
01:36:52,241 --> 01:36:54,601
I'm not Kishan.
- Are you not Kishan?

1263
01:36:54,681 --> 01:36:57,321
I'm not Kishan.
- I'm not, I'm not, I'm not!

1264
01:36:57,401 --> 01:37:00,841
You are slapping me
for refusing to say that I am not!?

1265
01:37:00,921 --> 01:37:03,921
If you are not Kishan,
land a slap on my cheek

1266
01:37:05,081 --> 01:37:09,641
Go ahead. If you are not Kishan,
give me a slap on my cheek!

1267
01:37:10,401 --> 01:37:11,241
Hit me!

1268
01:37:12,601 --> 01:37:15,401
Hit him... hit!

1269
01:37:21,281 --> 01:37:22,641
Take him and get the
hell out of here!

1270
01:37:22,721 --> 01:37:26,241
I'm sparing him because he happens
to be of my father's age!

1271
01:37:26,641 --> 01:37:29,601
Go away! Else, I won't
spare him either!

1272
01:37:30,081 --> 01:37:34,241
Go away... God! I'm running
out of patience!

1273
01:37:34,521 --> 01:37:36,441
Go away!

1274
01:37:42,561 --> 01:37:46,601
Balram! Jai!

1275
01:37:47,241 --> 01:37:50,121
Yes, father? Yes?

1276
01:37:52,801 --> 01:37:55,761
You idiots have been blind!

1277
01:37:56,841 --> 01:38:00,161
You never asked Kishan where
he went and whom he met!

1278
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:02,881
I ought to have had the
whole information!

1279
01:38:03,401 --> 01:38:06,041
He's not setting foot in
this house ever again!

1280
01:38:07,041 --> 01:38:08,041
Very well, father

1281
01:38:08,481 --> 01:38:11,161
Even if he comes, he's not getting
in without meeting me

1282
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:13,721
Even if it happens to be
in the dead of the night!

1283
01:38:14,041 --> 01:38:15,121
Very well, father

1284
01:38:20,481 --> 01:38:25,921
Hail Lord Bairangbali!
Lord of Celibacy...

1285
01:38:26,001 --> 01:38:31,201
To Thee I offer my obeisance's,
O Devotee of Lord Rama...

1286
01:38:31,281 --> 01:38:36,281
O Almighty Lord...

1287
01:38:57,761 --> 01:39:02,641
Why have you called all
of us here, father?

1288
01:39:06,001 --> 01:39:09,281
You boys are now perhaps beginning
to think that...

1289
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:11,361
I'm ruining your lives

1290
01:39:12,601 --> 01:39:17,521
By not getting you married, I'm
sowing thorns in your lives

1291
01:39:18,921 --> 01:39:19,641
Is that true?

1292
01:39:21,921 --> 01:39:25,841
Father, why are you
saying such things?

1293
01:39:29,161 --> 01:39:32,481
Answer my question. Do you
really think like that?

1294
01:39:32,961 --> 01:39:34,161
No, not at all

1295
01:39:37,681 --> 01:39:39,681
I don't think like
that either, father

1296
01:39:43,201 --> 01:39:45,201
And what do you think?

1297
01:39:46,081 --> 01:39:48,201
No, father. The two of us
don't like that either

1298
01:39:48,281 --> 01:39:51,401
Talk only for yourself. He'll
speak for what he thinks

1299
01:39:54,681 --> 01:39:56,481
I haven't thought like
that so far, father

1300
01:39:57,121 --> 01:40:00,121
Which means you might start
thinking like that in the future?

1301
01:40:01,521 --> 01:40:02,081
No

1302
01:40:04,121 --> 01:40:08,561
In that case, I've begun to think
that I've made a very grave mistake.

1303
01:40:08,641 --> 01:40:10,161
...by not getting my sons married

1304
01:40:11,121 --> 01:40:13,521
When there was a proposal for
Shakti long ago, I had laid down...

1305
01:40:13,601 --> 01:40:14,841
...a condition

1306
01:40:15,401 --> 01:40:18,721
That Balram would get married
first and only then...

1307
01:40:19,801 --> 01:40:22,001
anyway, I withdraw
that condition now

1308
01:40:22,441 --> 01:40:24,401
Let him not get married,
if he doesn't want to

1309
01:40:24,721 --> 01:40:27,961
But the rest of you must get
married. You must, mustn't you?

1310
01:40:29,681 --> 01:40:34,441
And thus I have decided, that
Kishan will get married first

1311
01:40:36,601 --> 01:40:37,601
Why? What happened?

1312
01:40:39,521 --> 01:40:42,721
You will put the wedding necklace
around the girl of my choice...

1313
01:40:42,801 --> 01:40:45,121
...on an auspicious day

1314
01:40:48,601 --> 01:40:49,761
He's getting married?

1315
01:40:50,001 --> 01:40:51,881
Putting the wedding necklace
on another woman?

1316
01:40:52,401 --> 01:40:53,881
Let me see how he gets married

1317
01:40:54,201 --> 01:40:56,681
He's not doing it out of his own
will. He's being forced into it

1318
01:40:56,961 --> 01:40:59,521
His father has locked him up
and he's getting him married.

1319
01:40:59,601 --> 01:41:00,201
I swear to that!

1320
01:41:00,281 --> 01:41:01,921
And he's getting married too?
- Yes

1321
01:41:02,001 --> 01:41:05,401
Before he does that, he'll have
to see me and my children dead!

1322
01:41:05,481 --> 01:41:07,241
What are you doing? Listen!

1323
01:41:08,921 --> 01:41:10,721
This is getting worse!
Sister-in-law...

1324
01:41:10,801 --> 01:41:13,201
Listen to me, sis-in-law...

1325
01:41:13,721 --> 01:41:15,201
Sister-in-law... - Come on.

1326
01:41:16,561 --> 01:41:20,081
What will I listen to now? Who
do I have in the world anyway?

1327
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:21,721
I'm here for you.
- Shut up!

1328
01:41:21,961 --> 01:41:25,281
Look at your face! Toad!
- Toad?

1329
01:41:25,481 --> 01:41:27,841
Sister-in-law... - My children
and I are doing to die!

1330
01:41:27,921 --> 01:41:30,521
Sister-in-law... what are you doing?

1331
01:41:31,241 --> 01:41:36,321
Please don't do something
rash! Sister-in-law!

1332
01:41:36,561 --> 01:41:39,401
I have to answer all the questions!
Please, sister-in-law...

1333
01:41:40,241 --> 01:41:44,681
I'll break open the door! I'm
telling you, I'll break it!

1334
01:41:44,801 --> 01:41:46,401
Here I come!

1335
01:41:56,401 --> 01:41:58,041
Won't you even let me change?

1336
01:41:58,121 --> 01:42:01,801
You're wrecked the utensils,
cursed chap! Damn you!

1337
01:42:10,281 --> 01:42:11,681
Balram...

1338
01:42:12,081 --> 01:42:15,081
we're going out for a while.
- Come on, dear...

1339
01:42:25,008 --> 01:42:28,608
The way he broke the pitcher!
Fantastic!

1340
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:32,848
Brother, Gopi...
- Yes, she's going to whack Krishna!

1341
01:42:33,248 --> 01:42:34,808
Brother! Sister-in-law Gopi!

1342
01:42:37,928 --> 01:42:42,328
Hey girl... what do you think
you're walking into?

1343
01:42:42,768 --> 01:42:45,728
Stay out! Haven't you read
the signboard? Get out!

1344
01:42:46,408 --> 01:42:49,608
I'm not staying out! I'm
related to this family!

1345
01:42:49,688 --> 01:42:51,368
These children are part
of this family!

1346
01:42:51,608 --> 01:42:53,528
The sons in this family
are not even married!

1347
01:42:53,648 --> 01:42:57,048
So where did the kids come from?
She has gone mad!

1348
01:42:58,408 --> 01:43:01,848
No, I'm not mad. I'm your
son Kishan's wife, Gopi!

1349
01:43:02,168 --> 01:43:06,128
My brother's a respectable man!
If you utter a word against him.

1350
01:43:06,208 --> 01:43:08,448
We'll throw you out!
- Get lost!

1351
01:43:08,768 --> 01:43:12,088
Send my husband out first.
- Aren't you going away from here?

1352
01:43:13,008 --> 01:43:15,608
Kishan!
- Say I'm not in!

1353
01:43:15,909 --> 01:43:18,568
What will I say, where you've gone?
- Say I'm dead! Go on!

1354
01:43:18,888 --> 01:43:20,088
Coming, father!

1355
01:43:21,288 --> 01:43:23,928
Brother! It won't help
if you get scared!

1356
01:43:24,568 --> 01:43:28,128
Look at me... I'm
with you! Be brave!

1357
01:43:28,328 --> 01:43:30,768
There's no need to be scared!
Just do as I told you to!

1358
01:43:30,928 --> 01:43:35,968
Okay? Go on.
- No... you come with me... come!

1359
01:43:39,968 --> 01:43:41,328
What is the matter, father?

1360
01:43:41,368 --> 01:43:45,288
Are you not feeling well, son?
- I'm all right

1361
01:43:46,408 --> 01:43:47,408
Come here!

1362
01:43:50,608 --> 01:43:53,488
Is this your husband?
- Yes!

1363
01:43:53,848 --> 01:43:58,088
Look there. - Tell them!
That I'm your wife!

1364
01:43:58,448 --> 01:44:00,648
That you don't want to get
married a second time!

1365
01:44:01,128 --> 01:44:05,408
That these kids here are our own
children! Tell them, please!

1366
01:44:08,528 --> 01:44:11,768
What rubbish is she talking,
dad? Who is this woman?

1367
01:44:11,968 --> 01:44:14,728
That's exactly what I'm
asking. Who is she?

1368
01:44:15,768 --> 01:44:17,848
You don't know... no?
- No

1369
01:44:18,408 --> 01:44:20,728
You don't know? No?

1370
01:44:21,568 --> 01:44:26,248
Cheat! You don't know me? Don't
you know these children?

1371
01:44:26,848 --> 01:44:29,928
When you got to know you're getting
a new wife, you forgot all...

1372
01:44:30,168 --> 01:44:31,408
...about us!

1373
01:44:31,688 --> 01:44:33,168
Answer me... speak up!

1374
01:44:37,448 --> 01:44:43,328
Do you have any proof. A ring,
perhaps? Or a locket?

1375
01:44:43,848 --> 01:44:46,168
Yes, I do!
- What?

1376
01:44:46,208 --> 01:44:48,568
The wedding necklace. The
vermilion on my forehead!

1377
01:44:49,368 --> 01:44:51,128
And these two children!

1378
01:44:53,088 --> 01:44:56,488
Swear it on their heads that
they are not your children!

1379
01:44:57,408 --> 01:45:01,288
That I'm not your wife! If
even that's not enough...

1380
01:45:01,408 --> 01:45:03,928
where's your brother
Jai? Where is he?

1381
01:45:04,648 --> 01:45:08,168
There he is... hiding there!

1382
01:45:08,528 --> 01:45:11,568
Call him out and ask him;
he knows the whole truth

1383
01:45:12,088 --> 01:45:13,968
Jai! Come on out!

1384
01:45:15,128 --> 01:45:17,368
Yes, father?
- Come here

1385
01:45:21,528 --> 01:45:25,048
Do you know this woman?
- Brother-in-law...

1386
01:45:25,968 --> 01:45:28,448
at least you must admit
that you know me!

1387
01:45:29,048 --> 01:45:31,448
That I'm your sister-in-law,
that these are our children!

1388
01:45:31,608 --> 01:45:32,688
Tell them!

1389
01:45:35,608 --> 01:45:38,728
I've asked you a question,
Jai! Do you know her?

1390
01:45:40,168 --> 01:45:43,128
Yes, I know her

1391
01:45:45,128 --> 01:45:47,528
It's an old habit of hers to take
her children into families to...

1392
01:45:47,608 --> 01:45:49,448
...extract money

1393
01:45:49,528 --> 01:45:52,648
My God! - It's true.
I've seen her many times!

1394
01:45:53,208 --> 01:45:55,128
For him this sinful earning
seems to be everything.

1395
01:45:55,368 --> 01:45:57,128
Women like her must
go to the police!

1396
01:45:57,208 --> 01:45:59,208
Brother... why drag
the police into this?

1397
01:45:59,288 --> 01:46:02,288
What a shame! This wretched woman...

1398
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:04,968
Brother! It'll be even more
shameful if the police arrive here

1399
01:46:05,128 --> 01:46:07,728
Why?
- Well, maybe they will suspect us

1400
01:46:08,128 --> 01:46:10,848
I'll see her off.
- I'm not going away!

1401
01:46:11,368 --> 01:46:14,368
Sinners! I'm not going anywhere!

1402
01:46:14,608 --> 01:46:17,288
Silence! Who knows whose bundles
of sin they are...

1403
01:46:17,368 --> 01:46:19,928
who knows what you're trying
to palm off to us!

1404
01:46:20,128 --> 01:46:23,488
Throw them in a well or the rivers!

1405
01:46:23,568 --> 01:46:26,888
Oh yes, that is what I will
do! To save my husband...

1406
01:46:27,128 --> 01:46:29,648
I'll strangle my motherly
instincts! Just you watch...

1407
01:46:30,208 --> 01:46:33,928
I'll dump them in the well of your
very own house. C'mon, come...

1408
01:46:39,248 --> 01:46:40,328
Come on...

1409
01:46:42,328 --> 01:46:48,968
Gopi, listen to me! Don't do it...

1410
01:46:49,368 --> 01:46:52,248
Give the child to me, Gopi.
You are my wife...

1411
01:46:52,328 --> 01:46:54,008
and these are our children!

1412
01:46:54,088 --> 01:46:57,008
I played this drama only
to save your lives

1413
01:46:58,208 --> 01:47:00,168
But I'm not scared
of anyone anymore.

1414
01:47:01,288 --> 01:47:03,128
Let them discover what they want to

1415
01:47:21,448 --> 01:47:25,608
Father... forgive me

1416
01:47:28,168 --> 01:47:29,928
I've been deceiving you

1417
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:34,728
Please forgive me. Please pardon me

1418
01:47:39,288 --> 01:47:44,568
Filthy scoundrel! You want
me to forgive you? You cur!

1419
01:47:45,888 --> 01:47:48,648
Get up! Up, I say!

1420
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:55,728
What did you think? I pretended
to get you married...

1421
01:47:55,888 --> 01:47:57,648
only to make you speak the truth!

1422
01:47:59,488 --> 01:48:00,568
Scoundrel!

1423
01:48:00,768 --> 01:48:05,168
You are his elder brother!
Stop your father... please!

1424
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:07,568
Rascal... Out of my way, girl!

1425
01:48:07,648 --> 01:48:13,128
Please let him go!
- Lay off! Stay away!

1426
01:48:13,728 --> 01:48:17,768
Shakti, drag her away! You
dare deceive your father!

1427
01:48:20,968 --> 01:48:24,968
I'm going to kill you! And
you want me to pardon you?

1428
01:48:25,608 --> 01:48:29,448
When the handle of a sword snaps,
it's your own hand that is injured!

1429
01:48:29,648 --> 01:48:32,128
You dirty scoundrel! Get up...

1430
01:48:34,368 --> 01:48:35,808
I'm not going to spare you!

1431
01:48:37,528 --> 01:48:41,048
Insolent! How dare you
hold father's hand?

1432
01:48:41,328 --> 01:48:44,488
No one has dared hold
his hand, or stop him

1433
01:48:44,688 --> 01:48:47,208
Go and ask for his forgiveness.
Fall at his feet and apologise!

1434
01:48:47,368 --> 01:48:50,248
I've made no mistake for which I
must seek forgiveness from father!

1435
01:48:51,128 --> 01:48:52,728
What sin has brother
Kishan committed...

1436
01:48:52,888 --> 01:48:54,728
...to get beaten up so mercilessly?

1437
01:48:56,328 --> 01:48:57,648
He got married, he has two innocent
little children...

1438
01:48:57,808 --> 01:48:59,128
is that the reason?

1439
01:49:00,488 --> 01:49:02,768
If you still think I've
done wrong, kill me...

1440
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:05,288
but I cannot stand by father
in this injustice!

1441
01:49:08,688 --> 01:49:13,568
What do you need us for, father?
Why're you taking care of us?

1442
01:49:15,008 --> 01:49:16,368
To get beaten up by you?

1443
01:49:16,688 --> 01:49:18,848
Or get into brawls with
people for your sake?

1444
01:49:21,208 --> 01:49:23,408
You don't need sons, what
you need are thugs!

1445
01:49:25,408 --> 01:49:27,768
You need not your flesh and
blood, you need monsters!

1446
01:49:30,528 --> 01:49:32,528
What are you watching, wastrels?

1447
01:49:33,728 --> 01:49:36,128
Throw the two of them
out of the house!

1448
01:49:36,208 --> 01:49:39,008
I don't want sons who are
not loyal to their father!

1449
01:49:39,368 --> 01:49:41,328
They no longer exist for me!

1450
01:49:41,888 --> 01:49:44,408
Ask two people to lend a shoulder
to carry my bier...

1451
01:49:44,728 --> 01:49:46,368
but don't ever ask them
to touch my body!

1452
01:49:46,688 --> 01:49:49,888
Get the hell out of here!
Go away, you scoundrels!

1453
01:49:52,808 --> 01:49:55,608
Henceforth, Angarchand shall
have only two sons

1454
01:49:56,168 --> 01:49:58,928
After my death, don't even let
them get a glimpse of my body!

1455
01:50:06,888 --> 01:50:10,408
Broken! Angarchand's arrogance
is shattered!

1456
01:50:10,568 --> 01:50:12,928
Ruin what is left of Angarchand!
Finish him!

1457
01:50:13,128 --> 01:50:14,608
Finish that wretch off, too.

1458
01:50:14,688 --> 01:50:17,928
Angarchand's sons are
enough to finish him

1459
01:50:18,688 --> 01:50:21,128
Let the fireworks continue.
Let there be a celebration!

1460
01:50:34,694 --> 01:50:38,694
How did you get here?
- I walked in through the door

1461
01:50:39,134 --> 01:50:42,214
You talk too much, don't you?
What have you come here for?

1462
01:50:43,334 --> 01:50:44,454
I have come to meet Anjali.

1463
01:50:44,534 --> 01:50:46,534
What have you to do
with my daughter?

1464
01:50:47,494 --> 01:50:49,374
That's something I'll tell only
her. Please call her here

1465
01:51:08,534 --> 01:51:12,374
Anjali, as I promised, I've left
everything and come to you

1466
01:51:13,054 --> 01:51:14,734
My family and home... everything.

1467
01:51:15,214 --> 01:51:16,494
You must fulfill your promise now

1468
01:51:16,574 --> 01:51:18,854
Hey! What rubbish are you talking?

1469
01:51:18,934 --> 01:51:21,894
You walk into our house
and play with our honour?

1470
01:51:22,534 --> 01:51:24,934
You keep out of this.
Let me talk to him

1471
01:51:25,174 --> 01:51:30,054
My child, tell him, that you
are not in love with him...

1472
01:51:30,454 --> 01:51:32,534
that the love was only a pretence!

1473
01:51:33,174 --> 01:51:37,454
Also tell him that even if his
father comes at begs at our doorstep.

1474
01:51:37,614 --> 01:51:39,174
...you will still not
change your decision!

1475
01:51:41,094 --> 01:51:45,094
What did you think? That my
child would go away with you?

1476
01:51:45,454 --> 01:51:48,454
She was only taking revenge
from you! - That's a lie!

1477
01:51:50,094 --> 01:51:53,254
Anjali, tell them that
this is not the truth!

1478
01:51:57,774 --> 01:52:01,334
Why are you quiet? Tell them that
we're in love with each other!

1479
01:52:04,574 --> 01:52:06,174
Tell them what we have decided!

1480
01:52:07,854 --> 01:52:12,814
Now get the hell out of here! Or
you'll be crippled... get out!

1481
01:52:13,054 --> 01:52:16,454
You don't need to be afraid
of anyone. I'm with you

1482
01:52:25,774 --> 01:52:28,214
Separate them...
- Let her go!

1483
01:52:29,094 --> 01:52:32,774
Get inside. I'm going to kill you!

1484
01:52:32,894 --> 01:52:34,454
I'm going to kill you!

1485
01:52:34,574 --> 01:52:37,334
Don't dare touch!

1486
01:52:37,894 --> 01:52:41,374
Your father's going to carry
your corpse away from here!

1487
01:52:41,454 --> 01:52:44,414
What are you doing?
- Go away!

1488
01:52:44,614 --> 01:52:47,054
Or I'll take you apart
with my bare hands!

1489
01:52:47,134 --> 01:52:48,374
Oh get lost!

1490
01:52:49,094 --> 01:52:51,694
I only came to see whether
my love would stand by me

1491
01:52:52,974 --> 01:52:55,214
After what happened, I can see
from your face that

1492
01:52:55,294 --> 01:52:56,654
I needn't say anything!

1493
01:52:58,294 --> 01:53:01,894
I will come and take her away.
Do what you can to prevent me!

1494
01:53:07,894 --> 01:53:11,774
Will you go to meet him?
Will you? Speak up!

1495
01:53:11,854 --> 01:53:13,614
Yes, I will go! A thousand times!

1496
01:53:13,854 --> 01:53:15,574
I'll go to him every
time he calls me!

1497
01:53:15,614 --> 01:53:18,614
You will go to meet him?
- Wait, let me deal with her

1498
01:53:18,694 --> 01:53:22,094
Ma, stop it!
- Let me go...

1499
01:53:22,574 --> 01:53:23,414
Anjali, you go inside.

1500
01:53:23,494 --> 01:53:26,334
What do you want to do? Kill her?

1501
01:53:26,414 --> 01:53:29,174
I told you not to interfere!
- You don't interfere!

1502
01:53:31,654 --> 01:53:34,094
Stay away!

1503
01:53:34,626 --> 01:53:38,734
Use your common sense!
This is all Ma's doing!

1504
01:53:39,294 --> 01:53:42,494
She's the one who instigated
Anjali. She's the one to blame!

1505
01:53:42,934 --> 01:53:44,534
Blame her... ask her!

1506
01:53:48,134 --> 01:53:50,974
What happened now? What?

1507
01:54:06,214 --> 01:54:09,174
Anjali, you come inside

1508
01:54:11,294 --> 01:54:12,054
Don't cry

1509
01:54:14,774 --> 01:54:17,134
Viru did right by stopping you!

1510
01:54:17,334 --> 01:54:19,654
What good will it do by
beating up the girl?

1511
01:54:20,014 --> 01:54:22,294
What had to happen has happened.

1512
01:54:22,854 --> 01:54:25,294
Now get the girl married
at the earliest

1513
01:54:25,454 --> 01:54:28,454
Make her see reason and bring
her back to the right path

1514
01:54:28,614 --> 01:54:29,974
Keep your advise to yourself!

1515
01:54:30,454 --> 01:54:33,734
It's because of your advise
that we have to see this day!

1516
01:54:33,934 --> 01:54:38,734
Why? All I said is that we ought
to plant a girl in that family

1517
01:54:39,334 --> 01:54:42,214
When did I say that we must send
the girl from your own family?

1518
01:54:42,574 --> 01:54:47,214
Enough, let's forget about this
and think of the future

1519
01:54:48,094 --> 01:54:52,174
At the earliest possible,
find a suitor for Anjali

1520
01:54:52,454 --> 01:54:55,294
She must be given away in marriage
in not more than a fortnight

1521
01:54:55,614 --> 01:54:58,374
In a fortnight? Am I going to
pluck the suitor from a tree?

1522
01:54:58,534 --> 01:54:59,694
Pluck him from wherever you have to!

1523
01:54:59,934 --> 01:55:01,054
It's just that he ought to be...

1524
01:55:01,134 --> 01:55:02,814
of an equal status and
command equal respect!

1525
01:55:02,974 --> 01:55:05,734
You're speaking as if I carry
such guys under my arms

1526
01:55:06,214 --> 01:55:08,414
As if I need to flap my
arms and they'd pop out!

1527
01:55:12,894 --> 01:55:15,174
Well? What have I done?

1528
01:55:17,294 --> 01:55:21,134
In that case, let's get the suitor
from your flapping arms

1529
01:55:22,454 --> 01:55:29,374
Dr Sattu... Satyendra. Your son.
What's wrong with him?

1530
01:55:30,374 --> 01:55:35,414
Yes, what's the problem with that?
- No, there is no problem...

1531
01:55:35,694 --> 01:55:37,814
We have no problems either.
Let's just go ahead

1532
01:55:39,294 --> 01:55:41,974
Actually, Jai has issued a threat
that

1533
01:55:42,614 --> 01:55:44,094
he'll do whatever he wants to

1534
01:55:46,094 --> 01:55:49,854
I hope he doesn't bump
off me and my son

1535
01:55:50,694 --> 01:55:52,934
No, he won't do anything

1536
01:56:09,494 --> 01:56:15,334
Don't ask me, my love, what
state my passions are in...

1537
01:56:15,494 --> 01:56:21,454
Don't ask me, my love, what
state my passions are in...

1538
01:56:21,654 --> 01:56:27,694
Don't ask me, my love, what
state my passions are in...

1539
01:56:28,174 --> 01:56:34,174
Robbed... plundered...
is my precious modesty

1540
01:57:02,734 --> 01:57:04,614
Why ever did I...

1541
01:57:05,734 --> 01:57:07,534
set out for the marketplace?

1542
01:57:08,694 --> 01:57:11,734
I met this faithless youth...

1543
01:57:12,054 --> 01:57:15,534
who asked me for my heart

1544
01:57:15,854 --> 01:57:21,814
He took me for a naive belle and
started forcing himself on me

1545
01:57:22,014 --> 01:57:27,654
How I fought back...
it was an eye-opener

1546
01:57:27,734 --> 01:57:33,654
I wonder why the treacherous
knave picked on me

1547
01:57:34,294 --> 01:57:40,534
Robbed... plundered...
is my precious modesty

1548
01:57:59,374 --> 01:58:01,094
Why ever did I...

1549
01:58:02,294 --> 01:58:04,574
go anywhere near his lair

1550
01:58:05,534 --> 01:58:11,974
He held my arm and said,
come closer, darling

1551
01:58:12,654 --> 01:58:18,454
I felt shy to begin with,
and then I was scared

1552
01:58:18,614 --> 01:58:24,534
When he reached for my finger,
I freed my wrist

1553
01:58:24,574 --> 01:58:30,854
That was the first night, I
couldn't realise what he was upto

1554
01:58:30,934 --> 01:58:32,774
Plundered, robbed...

1555
01:58:32,854 --> 01:58:35,974
You've been thrashed and thrown
out of the house, isn't it?

1556
01:58:36,134 --> 01:58:38,094
But you needn't worry. I'm with you

1557
01:58:38,374 --> 01:58:40,494
If there's anything you want,
just let me know

1558
01:58:40,814 --> 01:58:44,094
Give the gentlemen two cups
of tea! In my account

1559
01:58:44,734 --> 01:58:49,014
If we need anything from your
account, we'll let you know

1560
01:58:50,094 --> 01:58:53,974
That'll be too late. We have
an old score to settle

1561
01:58:55,654 --> 01:58:58,774
So let's settle it now.
- That's what I'm here for

1562
01:59:31,934 --> 01:59:34,414
Some thugs are beating up your
brothers in the cattle market!

1563
01:59:34,614 --> 01:59:36,454
Hurry up! Else, they'll get killed

1564
02:00:37,574 --> 02:00:40,054
Who sent you here?
- Laxmi Devi

1565
02:00:59,239 --> 02:01:00,439
Come on out, you rats!

1566
02:01:00,616 --> 02:01:03,399
You guys are holed up here
after sending hired goons?

1567
02:01:03,839 --> 02:01:04,879
Come on out!

1568
02:01:10,159 --> 02:01:13,959
Hey old hag... you think you're
going to make us brothers fight?

1569
02:01:14,679 --> 02:01:18,119
Remember, even if we brothers
have a thousand differences...

1570
02:01:18,319 --> 02:01:20,479
if someone casts a stone at us,

1571
02:01:20,639 --> 02:01:22,599
your sons won't have heads on their shoulders!

1572
02:01:22,999 --> 02:01:26,279
And we won't hire thugs. We'll
come here on our own...

1573
02:01:26,479 --> 02:01:30,199
and settle the issue! I'm telling
you that. You get it, old hag?

1574
02:01:30,279 --> 02:01:32,519
Go away, you dog...

1575
02:01:46,599 --> 02:01:47,319
Wait!

1576
02:01:51,639 --> 02:01:54,919
You are a loudmouth indeed!
What did you say?

1577
02:01:55,479 --> 02:02:00,679
If someone casts a stone at you,
my sons will be beheaded?

1578
02:02:01,079 --> 02:02:05,159
In that case, I'll have your
brother garlanded instead!

1579
02:02:07,359 --> 02:02:10,359
Do you know why your brother
spat in your father's face...

1580
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:14,719
and walked out of the house?
To marry my grand-daughter!

1581
02:02:17,239 --> 02:02:18,359
I'll make sure...

1582
02:02:18,439 --> 02:02:20,519
that your brother puts the
bridal necklace around my...

1583
02:02:20,599 --> 02:02:22,119
...grand-daughter's neck!

1584
02:02:26,879 --> 02:02:30,639
And that necklace is going to
strangle your father to death!

1585
02:02:33,319 --> 02:02:35,879
Go and tell your father,
the burnt out ember...

1586
02:02:36,199 --> 02:02:37,559
to stop it, if he can!

1587
02:02:47,239 --> 02:02:48,599
Mother, what nonsense
are you talking.

1588
02:02:48,679 --> 02:02:50,279
Whom did you ask
before saying that?

1589
02:02:50,759 --> 02:02:53,479
My daughter and that
beggar? Never!

1590
02:02:53,879 --> 02:02:56,199
If you're going to decide
everything on your own...

1591
02:02:56,479 --> 02:02:58,039
why are we here with you?

1592
02:02:58,599 --> 02:03:01,319
You morons will always
get things wrong

1593
02:03:01,839 --> 02:03:03,839
Will I let the marriage happen
just because I've said so?

1594
02:03:04,159 --> 02:03:06,079
She'll marry the suitor
you choose for her

1595
02:03:06,159 --> 02:03:08,519
In that case, why did
you tell lies to them?

1596
02:03:08,759 --> 02:03:09,519
I did.

1597
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:13,279
If I didn't, all our efforts till
now would have gone down the drain

1598
02:03:13,559 --> 02:03:17,199
Now watch their story
coming to an end!

1599
02:03:26,959 --> 02:03:28,039
Command me, father

1600
02:03:29,999 --> 02:03:31,639
Do I bring him alive or dead?

1601
02:03:44,708 --> 02:03:45,988
Stop there!

1602
02:03:46,148 --> 02:03:48,108
Whose permission did you take
to set foot on this land?

1603
02:03:48,308 --> 02:03:50,468
We are not here to fight.

1604
02:03:50,948 --> 02:03:52,108
Have you brought a match then?

1605
02:03:52,388 --> 02:03:55,108
Get going.
- We always heard that Angarchand...

1606
02:03:55,188 --> 02:03:58,228
never turned away anyone who
came asking for his help

1607
02:03:58,588 --> 02:04:00,708
Damn you guys... get
the hell out of here!

1608
02:04:00,988 --> 02:04:03,908
Hold it, Shakti... Let them come

1609
02:04:13,388 --> 02:04:14,788
My respects

1610
02:04:16,228 --> 02:04:17,948
Please forgive us, Angarchand

1611
02:04:19,308 --> 02:04:24,308
Please don't harbour any will
for the mistakes we have made

1612
02:04:25,868 --> 02:04:28,068
Please forget everything
- Damn it!

1613
02:04:28,508 --> 02:04:34,588
Your son had come to our mother,
asking for help to marry my daughter

1614
02:04:35,348 --> 02:04:37,508
And mother only wants to
defeat you. All the time

1615
02:04:37,908 --> 02:04:40,428
So she reiected the match
we had decided for the girl

1616
02:04:40,628 --> 02:04:42,108
My mother is now insisting...

1617
02:04:42,468 --> 02:04:45,988
that she will have my daughter
married to your son at any cost

1618
02:04:48,668 --> 02:04:55,308
However, we want her to marry the
one we have fixed her wedding with

1619
02:04:56,428 --> 02:05:00,988
If our mother or your son still
try to disrupt this wedding...

1620
02:05:02,068 --> 02:05:03,588
we'll have to do something about it

1621
02:05:04,388 --> 02:05:06,748
You decide now...
- You will have to do nothing

1622
02:05:07,668 --> 02:05:09,548
I'll be the one who will
do what needs to be done

1623
02:05:10,668 --> 02:05:12,708
You want this marriage to
take place, isn't it?

1624
02:05:13,028 --> 02:05:17,348
I'll make sure she marries the
suitor you have chosen for her

1625
02:05:18,388 --> 02:05:20,068
Father...
- Shakti!

1626
02:05:20,988 --> 02:05:25,548
When someone's lying on the floor,
you have to bow to pick him up

1627
02:05:26,108 --> 02:05:30,508
I'd take defeat from anyone! But
if I'm defeated by my own son...

1628
02:05:31,068 --> 02:05:33,228
I'll be ashamed of myself!

1629
02:05:33,908 --> 02:05:36,388
Where's your father's
respect and honour?

1630
02:05:36,588 --> 02:05:38,068
He was so proud of himself!

1631
02:05:38,148 --> 02:05:41,588
But only to defeat his son, he will
go and guard someone else's wedding!

1632
02:05:42,028 --> 02:05:44,388
Is he a landlord or a watchman?
- That's enough...

1633
02:05:44,468 --> 02:05:46,868
Brother, you had to
loose your head now only?

1634
02:05:46,948 --> 02:05:49,028
Could you suggest a better time?

1635
02:05:49,548 --> 02:05:51,388
I could wrap your legs
around your neck!

1636
02:05:51,948 --> 02:05:54,628
I'm already in trouble and...
here she comes!

1637
02:05:54,948 --> 02:05:56,668
But what he want?

1638
02:05:56,948 --> 02:06:00,708
And have Anpara's daughter
married? Tell me!

1639
02:06:01,068 --> 02:06:04,068
Madam Gopi, your yelling is
getting to be too much!

1640
02:06:04,348 --> 02:06:07,228
Jai, if you're going to sit
here and listen to him...

1641
02:06:07,388 --> 02:06:08,948
you might as well do
it all your life!

1642
02:06:09,028 --> 02:06:11,348
We must go there and
stop the wedding!

1643
02:06:11,708 --> 02:06:13,828
Whether we have to take on
a demon or your father!

1644
02:06:14,508 --> 02:06:16,828
You tell me, you want
to marry that girl or not?

1645
02:06:17,148 --> 02:06:18,588
Who's this so late in the night?

1646
02:06:23,068 --> 02:06:25,348
My sons and your father
have got together

1647
02:06:26,308 --> 02:06:30,068
But nothing means more to
me than Anjali's happiness

1648
02:06:30,988 --> 02:06:35,268
And thus I, an elderly woman,
appeal to you...

1649
02:06:36,348 --> 02:06:37,628
you must surely come there

1650
02:06:37,908 --> 02:06:39,748
and tie the wedding necklace around her neck

1651
02:06:41,388 --> 02:06:43,908
It is in this hope that I will
dress my little girl as a bride...

1652
02:06:44,228 --> 02:06:46,148
and send her to the wedding altar

1653
02:06:48,388 --> 02:06:49,628
Please preserve my honour

1654
02:07:09,388 --> 02:07:11,428
I know what my mother
must've said to you

1655
02:07:12,788 --> 02:07:13,988
And what do you think?

1656
02:07:14,548 --> 02:07:16,348
Is she really going to
get you married to her?

1657
02:07:16,868 --> 02:07:19,428
She only wants you and your father
to fight between yourselves

1658
02:07:19,868 --> 02:07:21,668
And that is why she came
here at this late hour

1659
02:07:24,228 --> 02:07:26,468
It wasn't to get you married to her

1660
02:07:27,508 --> 02:07:28,628
Maybe you don't know...

1661
02:07:28,708 --> 02:07:30,228
...but my mother is very much
a part of the conspiracy

1662
02:07:30,308 --> 02:07:33,828
Just as she came to you to ask you
to tie the wedding necklace...

1663
02:07:34,188 --> 02:07:37,508
my brothers went to your father,
to seek his help...

1664
02:07:37,588 --> 02:07:40,388
at my mother's behest.
- This is a new ploy!

1665
02:07:40,868 --> 02:07:42,788
When they saw that you're going
to get married to her...

1666
02:07:42,868 --> 02:07:44,108
they're using new tactics!

1667
02:07:44,428 --> 02:07:47,948
- We know how to get the wedding done get going!
- Get lost!

1668
02:07:48,628 --> 02:07:51,108
Bloody toad! One punch and
you'll be flattened out!

1669
02:07:51,188 --> 02:07:54,588
What are you doing? Get out!
- Listen to me...

1670
02:07:55,228 --> 02:07:56,708
Hear me out, Jai!
- Get out!

1671
02:08:04,628 --> 02:08:07,908
I haven't revealed all this to you
because I'm worried about you

1672
02:08:08,868 --> 02:08:11,668
It's the girl I'm worried about.
The one who's part of my family

1673
02:08:12,268 --> 02:08:14,588
She asked me to warn you...

1674
02:08:15,228 --> 02:08:17,868
so that you wouldn't fight your
father and cause each other's death!

1675
02:08:19,188 --> 02:08:20,508
Else, she's not going to live

1676
02:08:31,948 --> 02:08:34,348
You want to die?
Get out of the way!

1677
02:08:34,988 --> 02:08:37,668
Run me over! So you can all win!

1678
02:08:39,708 --> 02:08:41,348
Whom are you out to defeat, father?

1679
02:08:41,868 --> 02:08:44,508
You're going to guard their
wedding, so you can defeat me?

1680
02:08:45,828 --> 02:08:48,388
Which son has ever won glory
by humiliating his father?

1681
02:08:51,668 --> 02:08:53,588
Won't you get out of the way?
- I won't!

1682
02:08:53,868 --> 02:08:55,508
You will have to hear me out!

1683
02:08:56,028 --> 02:08:57,988
They're plotting to
deceive you, father!

1684
02:08:58,508 --> 02:09:00,708
Don't give them any help...
- Balram!

1685
02:09:01,428 --> 02:09:04,188
Rather than talk to him, run
him over with the car.

1686
02:09:04,268 --> 02:09:05,228
Let's get going!

1687
02:09:05,308 --> 02:09:06,948
But hear me out at least!

1688
02:09:07,268 --> 02:09:09,508
I'm telling you that I'm not
going there, father. I'm not!

1689
02:09:09,828 --> 02:09:14,708
You mustn't go there either You
mean the world to me, father!

1690
02:09:18,348 --> 02:09:20,468
I let you go once,
because I loved you

1691
02:09:21,508 --> 02:09:22,948
But don't put me to anymore tests.

1692
02:09:23,748 --> 02:09:25,708
Father means the world to us also

1693
02:09:26,028 --> 02:09:29,348
Which is why we will go there and
make sure the wedding takes place

1694
02:09:29,988 --> 02:09:33,188
If you get there and try
to disrupt the wedding...

1695
02:09:35,668 --> 02:09:38,388
I can even take your life to
make father keep his promise

1696
02:09:39,508 --> 02:09:42,308
This is Angarchand's son Balram
speaking to you...

1697
02:09:42,548 --> 02:09:43,588
is that understood?

1698
02:09:44,108 --> 02:09:48,268
I'm the same father's son!
But if this is the case...

1699
02:09:49,148 --> 02:09:51,308
I'll prevent the marriage
from taking place!

1700
02:10:02,268 --> 02:10:04,868
Greetings. - Who is that?

1701
02:10:05,388 --> 02:10:07,428
My sister-in-law and
my brother-in-law

1702
02:10:08,108 --> 02:10:09,348
Welcome...

1703
02:10:13,988 --> 02:10:15,108
Who are they?

1704
02:10:15,308 --> 02:10:18,388
The chief from the neighbouring
village. With his wife

1705
02:10:19,028 --> 02:10:20,228
Welcome

1706
02:10:20,508 --> 02:10:24,708
Stand right here! And don't budge,
unless I ask you to!

1707
02:10:31,108 --> 02:10:33,348
Don't waste time. Get
those vessels out!

1708
02:10:39,348 --> 02:10:41,108
Hey... wait there

1709
02:10:43,988 --> 02:10:45,908
Balram, check out who they are

1710
02:10:50,188 --> 02:10:53,588
I'll take a look, don't bother.
That's how they are...

1711
02:10:53,668 --> 02:10:55,068
latecomers!

1712
02:10:55,228 --> 02:10:59,068
I'll take care of them.
- Hurry up

1713
02:11:02,148 --> 02:11:05,508
Who is it? Gangatai?
Go on... Quick!

1714
02:11:07,828 --> 02:11:10,348
Why're you so late?
- I couldn't find huge vessels

1715
02:11:10,708 --> 02:11:13,948
All right... Babubhai... go ahead

1716
02:11:14,668 --> 02:11:15,588
Hurry up.

1717
02:11:16,508 --> 02:11:18,028
So you're here, too?

1718
02:11:18,108 --> 02:11:20,708
Let the marriage take place.
You'll see then...

1719
02:11:22,028 --> 02:11:22,828
Come.

1720
02:11:25,988 --> 02:11:27,108
Come.

1721
02:11:35,828 --> 02:11:37,868
I'm glad we covered our faces.
Else, we'd have been beaten up

1722
02:11:38,028 --> 02:11:41,828
Always cover your face, you
rascal... - Quiet, brother!

1723
02:11:43,348 --> 02:11:45,868
Stand up! Why're you sitting?
- Who asked you to sit?

1724
02:11:46,068 --> 02:11:47,108
Sit quietly, pal.

1725
02:11:48,308 --> 02:11:50,788
They're not serving a feast here,
bro! Get to your feet!

1726
02:11:52,628 --> 02:11:53,708
What are you doing?

1727
02:11:53,788 --> 02:11:57,588
Where to? Come on, quick!
And don't make a noise!

1728
02:11:57,748 --> 02:11:59,748
Damn this loincloth!

1729
02:12:01,588 --> 02:12:06,588
Go and stand by the toilet.
I've drawn up a plan

1730
02:12:06,788 --> 02:12:10,068
Just stand by me. Okay?
Go on! Hurry!

1731
02:12:11,908 --> 02:12:14,468
What are you doing, Uncle?
- Standing by you

1732
02:12:15,348 --> 02:12:16,788
Remain standing. I'm leaving!

1733
02:12:18,068 --> 02:12:20,988
Stay here, no one must
get in from here, okay?

1734
02:12:25,508 --> 02:12:28,348
They're all very tense.
Anything could happen

1735
02:12:29,268 --> 02:12:31,988
I don't think he would take
the risk of coming here

1736
02:12:32,428 --> 02:12:34,348
Angarchand's keeping a strict vigil

1737
02:12:34,708 --> 02:12:37,868
If Jai lands here, Angarchand's
going to slit his neck!

1738
02:12:39,668 --> 02:12:42,708
You're out of your mind? You're
guarding a closed door!

1739
02:12:42,788 --> 02:12:43,868
Come here!

1740
02:12:43,948 --> 02:12:46,788
Guard this place... no
one must get through!

1741
02:12:47,468 --> 02:12:50,268
Sister-in-law, I hope there
won't be any trouble?

1742
02:12:50,428 --> 02:12:53,828
There will surely be trouble!
Jai's a very dangerous boy

1743
02:12:58,868 --> 02:13:01,028
Come here... quick!
- What? Is there trouble?

1744
02:13:01,268 --> 02:13:04,668
No, not yet. But who
knows about tomorrow?

1745
02:13:05,068 --> 02:13:06,708
Really?
- Come here, come

1746
02:13:07,388 --> 02:13:11,348
Don't be afraid, I'm with you.
Wet your throat, if you wish to

1747
02:13:11,548 --> 02:13:14,388
With what?
- Rum, whiskey... we have it all

1748
02:13:14,588 --> 02:13:16,948
We're all drunk.
- What if somebody finds out?

1749
02:13:17,028 --> 02:13:18,068
Nobody will get to know.

1750
02:13:18,148 --> 02:13:20,828
I'll send my brother-in-law,
he'll handle it

1751
02:13:20,908 --> 02:13:25,108
No, I don't want to...
- Yes, say that to him...

1752
02:13:25,268 --> 02:13:28,788
he'll force you and you
can gulp down a drink

1753
02:13:28,948 --> 02:13:30,988
I'll send him over... have patience

1754
02:13:33,028 --> 02:13:35,588
Brother-in-law! Come here!

1755
02:13:36,068 --> 02:13:37,788
There's a problem...
- What is it?

1756
02:13:38,508 --> 02:13:39,588
Nothing... you needn't yell

1757
02:13:39,908 --> 02:13:43,788
It's not so serious.
- So what is it?

1758
02:13:43,868 --> 02:13:47,028
The groom's getting the blues.
Because of the marriage

1759
02:13:47,188 --> 02:13:48,428
In his tummy.
- What's in his tummy?

1760
02:13:48,748 --> 02:13:51,668
What can be there?
He wants to go to the loo.

1761
02:13:51,748 --> 02:13:53,028
Is this the time for such things?

1762
02:13:53,228 --> 02:13:55,508
Can't he control it?
- How can he?

1763
02:13:55,588 --> 02:13:56,908
What if he wets his pants?

1764
02:13:57,268 --> 02:14:00,148
He's feeling shy... come and help, please

1765
02:14:00,228 --> 02:14:02,788
Why don't you take him to the loo?
- How can I?

1766
02:14:02,988 --> 02:14:03,828
There are women there.

1767
02:14:03,988 --> 02:14:05,668
An elderly man like you
can make them see reason

1768
02:14:05,828 --> 02:14:10,028
He's going to refuse, but you must
insist that he goes to the toilet

1769
02:14:10,188 --> 02:14:11,228
lmagine how nasty it'll look...

1770
02:14:11,308 --> 02:14:12,588
...if it happens in the
middle of the ceremony!

1771
02:14:13,148 --> 02:14:15,308
Nasty, right? So go on!

1772
02:14:18,308 --> 02:14:20,308
Come on.
- I don't want to do it

1773
02:14:20,348 --> 02:14:25,428
Do it right now... the pressure
will increase later

1774
02:14:25,628 --> 02:14:30,628
Nobody will get to know. Hurry up!
- But I don't want to...

1775
02:14:31,908 --> 02:14:34,588
Come with me, come...

1776
02:14:34,668 --> 02:14:38,428
Over there.
- But I don't want to do it

1777
02:14:38,628 --> 02:14:40,628
So what's wrong? Everybody does it!

1778
02:14:40,708 --> 02:14:43,908
Everybody does it?
- Yes, we do it early in the day

1779
02:14:44,428 --> 02:14:49,308
Ask the women to move there for
5 minutes... it's an emergency

1780
02:14:49,668 --> 02:14:51,508
Please come...
- Quick!

1781
02:14:52,348 --> 02:14:54,308
Hurry... there's water in there.

1782
02:14:54,388 --> 02:14:56,548
Get it over with quickly,
I'll stand right here

1783
02:14:57,468 --> 02:14:59,588
Won't you come in with me?
- Why must I?

1784
02:15:00,108 --> 02:15:04,948
To keep me company.
- No way! Go on inside!

1785
02:15:06,188 --> 02:15:07,348
Company!

1786
02:15:14,428 --> 02:15:15,428
Bad tummy, I see

1787
02:15:17,748 --> 02:15:19,748
Oh, you are here.
Where's the groom?

1788
02:15:20,148 --> 02:15:22,468
He's in the loo and
you're keeping guard?

1789
02:15:22,708 --> 02:15:25,228
The auspicious hour is passing
by, they're waiting for you

1790
02:15:25,308 --> 02:15:28,388
Have patience, the boy has a bad
tummy. Let him feel relieved

1791
02:15:28,468 --> 02:15:31,868
There'll be a flood at the altar!
- I'll handle the flood

1792
02:15:31,948 --> 02:15:35,508
Go outside, my wife's waiting
for you at the dining-hall

1793
02:15:35,588 --> 02:15:39,068
Right ahead, the room there?
- With your hands down... go

1794
02:15:39,148 --> 02:15:40,228
Why are you pushing?

1795
02:15:41,828 --> 02:15:42,908
Son.

1796
02:15:42,988 --> 02:15:44,828
Papa...
- My son... where are you?

1797
02:15:44,908 --> 02:15:46,828
Have you finished yet?

1798
02:16:54,268 --> 02:16:55,548
Sit down, dear

1799
02:16:59,108 --> 02:17:01,308
You chant some real good
mantras and really well at that.

1800
02:17:02,788 --> 02:17:04,108
Come, son.

1801
02:17:32,428 --> 02:17:33,868
Where's the groom's father?

1802
02:17:35,908 --> 02:17:37,588
Take his blessings

1803
02:18:30,308 --> 02:18:32,748
Look... it's Jai!

1804
02:18:35,588 --> 02:18:37,468
Put down that wedding necklace!
Put it down!

1805
02:18:37,548 --> 02:18:39,908
Set it down...
- Hold it. We're not stopping him

1806
02:18:40,068 --> 02:18:42,348
Let Angara stop him.
We mustn't interfere

1807
02:18:46,468 --> 02:18:48,708
Your son is here...

1808
02:18:48,948 --> 02:18:51,228
to put the wedding necklace around my grand-daughter's neck!

1809
02:18:51,508 --> 02:18:54,908
What sort of a man are you?
The whole world believes...

1810
02:18:55,188 --> 02:18:58,948
that Anpara never goes
back on a promise

1811
02:18:59,308 --> 02:19:02,708
If that is really true, you
must slit your son's throat!

1812
02:19:03,148 --> 02:19:07,028
Shakti, Balram... what
are you waiting for?

1813
02:19:07,588 --> 02:19:10,268
Can't you still see what's on
this woman's mind, father?

1814
02:19:10,948 --> 02:19:13,388
She didn't enact this drama
to have us married

1815
02:19:14,388 --> 02:19:17,068
She wanted us father and sons
to fight and kill each other...

1816
02:19:17,388 --> 02:19:18,908
that's the only thing she wanted!

1817
02:19:19,788 --> 02:19:23,668
I came here only to make
you realise the truth!

1818
02:19:25,268 --> 02:19:28,428
I have no intentions of defeating
you and marrying her

1819
02:19:32,468 --> 02:19:33,228
Forgive me

1820
02:19:34,748 --> 02:19:36,788
My father had once had
your wedding stalled

1821
02:19:38,548 --> 02:19:39,708
And it's my turn today

1822
02:19:41,428 --> 02:19:44,868
I can't give death to my father
to grant you a new life

1823
02:19:46,428 --> 02:19:51,308
Without my father's blessings and
approval, we cannot live together

1824
02:19:53,548 --> 02:19:54,268
Wait!

1825
02:19:59,788 --> 02:20:01,748
Put the wedding necklace
around her neck

1826
02:20:03,428 --> 02:20:05,148
Put it around her neck, I say

1827
02:20:06,308 --> 02:20:07,468
Only if father says

1828
02:20:09,788 --> 02:20:12,948
I know how father feels.
Do it without any fear

1829
02:20:13,948 --> 02:20:17,708
If you're really Angarchand's son,
put the necklace around her neck!

1830
02:20:18,348 --> 02:20:20,548
Snatch that necklace from him!
- Give it to me...

1831
02:20:21,388 --> 02:20:24,988
I have the necklace!
- Don't let anyone get you!

1832
02:20:36,028 --> 02:20:41,548
Here it is... on this woman!
- This is mine!

1833
02:20:47,788 --> 02:20:50,108
Get out!
- Gotcha!

1834
02:21:09,428 --> 02:21:12,548
Here you are... run
away with it! Run!

1835
02:21:15,068 --> 02:21:15,708
Jai!

1836
02:21:39,268 --> 02:21:42,388
You're old enough to be my father
and you're angling for me, rascal!

1837
02:21:44,908 --> 02:21:45,788
Shameless man!

1838
02:21:45,988 --> 02:21:48,468
Give that wedding necklace
to me! Give it!

1839
02:21:53,348 --> 02:21:55,788
What are you waiting for,
morons? Pick it up!

1840
02:22:00,268 --> 02:22:02,348
Jai! Come here!

1841
02:22:05,108 --> 02:22:06,148
Up there!

1842
02:22:17,708 --> 02:22:19,948
None of them must get
anywhere close to it

1843
02:22:20,268 --> 02:22:25,548
Without the wedding necklace,
the marriage cannot take place!

1844
02:22:54,828 --> 02:23:00,588
Get him! Catch him! After him!

1845
02:23:00,868 --> 02:23:03,708
Don't let him escape!

1846
02:23:16,348 --> 02:23:18,708
This has to do with the
honour of my family

1847
02:23:19,428 --> 02:23:21,548
If you wish to get to
my grand-daughter...

1848
02:23:22,228 --> 02:23:25,188
you'll have to finish all of us

1849
02:24:08,068 --> 02:24:09,108
No.

1850
02:24:17,668 --> 02:24:19,588
How much more of enmity, grandma?

1851
02:24:21,188 --> 02:24:23,428
Please forget everything
and accept our wedding

1852
02:24:35,228 --> 02:24:38,068
If you can't give us your blessings,
at least forgive us, father

1853
02:24:39,308 --> 02:24:41,268
We'll make a world of our
own someplace far away

1854
02:24:43,188 --> 02:24:46,388
No, you're not going anywhere.
Come here...

1855
02:24:47,148 --> 02:24:49,468
touch father's feet and
take his blessings

1856
02:24:51,188 --> 02:24:52,668
Gopi, here's our chance.

1857
02:24:52,868 --> 02:24:55,108
Let's touch father's feet
and take his blessings!

1858
02:26:02,228 --> 02:26:03,508
Come to me, my children.
