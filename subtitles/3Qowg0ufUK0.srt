00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,530

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,990
Check.

00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,780
[Shikha huffing]

6
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,730
[Shikha] There's a species of ants
found in the Amazon forest.

7
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,800
[Shikha] The bullet ant.

8
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,270
[Shikha] The bullet ant's
bite lasts for 24 hours.

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,870
[Shikha] And nothing in this
world is as painful as this bite.

10
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,430
[Shikha] The tribes over
there have a ritual.

11
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,280
[Shikha] For a boy to
become a warrior...

12
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,600
[Shikha]...he has to put his hands
in the bullet ant's nest.

13
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,510
[Shikha] If he tolerates this
pain without breaking or crying...

14
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,080
[Shikha]...then he
becomes a warrior.

15
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,340
You've always told me
that I'm your daughter..

16
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,460
...and I should not try to
be your son.

17
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,210
But I think you've forgotten
that I am YOUR daughter, Dad.

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,340
Every time, I proved the people
who discouraged me wrong.

19
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,770
I love you, Dad.

20
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,970
But it's time to put
my hand in the ant's nest.

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,930
Bring on the bullet ants.

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,160

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,950
Bend position, everybody.

26
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,240
- 100 pushups.
- One.

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,740
Two.

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,940
Three.

29
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,270
I am Naib Subedar Kripal Bhatti.

30
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,850
Seven...

31
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,540
Next few months are going to be
the toughest months of your life.

32
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,200
- Ten.
- Our only motive is... - Eleven.

33
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,210
- ...to break you from inside
and from outside. - 13.

34
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,900
Amongst the whole
of Indian Army...

35
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,810
....24 of you had the courage
to come here

36
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,490
Take a close look at the person
next to you.

37
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,080
And bid them farewell .

38
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,220
Because soon, either he won't be
a part of this course, or you won't.

39
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,400
23.

40
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,550
- 24.
- And the ones who are left...

41
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,350
...will be given an opportunity...

42
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,090
...to fight for the nation
and for their names.

43
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,620

44
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,060
- 46.
- She's very sexy.

45
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,970
- 47.
- A woman in a uniform.

46
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,030
48.

47
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,330
- Oh!
- 49!

48
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,390
50!

49
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,230
There's always a guy
in every batch...

50
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,240
...who thinks he is
smarter than others.

51
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,260
- Did you say something?
- No, sir.

52
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,220
I can even read your mind.

53
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,280
And he always has a bootlicker too.

54
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,690
Do you want to do 50 more pushups?

55
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,130
No, sir.

56
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,490

57
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,620

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,440

- We've never had such a weak batch.

00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,710

72
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,070
Shall I send you back?

73
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,120

Party, stop!

77
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,510
Here. Fall in!

78
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,870
We don't want you.

79
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,090
Let me repeat that.

80
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,910
We do not want you.

81
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,220
You all feel that you're
good enough...

82
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,890
...to be the elite of the elites,
don't you?

83
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,790
Are you capable of operating...

84
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,680
...without eating, drinking
and sleeping?

85
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,240
Are you capable of going
through the pain...

86
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,180
...which no one else can
even imagine?

87
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,900
Are you capable of keeping
the nation's respect...

88
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,310
...while putting yours at stake?

89
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,210
Are you capable of
this maroon beret?

90
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,130
- Yes, sir!
- Bullshit!

91
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,210
Bullshit!

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,600
Look at you.

93
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,460
- Sir, have you got the forms?
- Yes, sir.

94
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,070
Always.

95
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,450
These are your non-volunteer forms.

96
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,970
Please sign these and go
back to your units.

97
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,440
Please don't waste my time, okay?

98
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,430
One by one, please.

99
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,350
Come on.

100
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,880
Oh.

101
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,940
- So you all have guts to
prove me wrong? - Yes, sir!

102
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,140
- You want to enter hell?
- Yes, sir.

103
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,060
You want me to give
you the chance?

104
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,310
Yes, sir.

105
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,590
Until now...

106
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,150
...you all were from
Madras regiment...

107
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,100
...mechanised infantry...

108
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,530
...or artillery.

109
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,220
But henceforth,
you'll just have one identity.

110
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,150
You are a nobody.

111
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,570
- Were you winking at me?
- No, sir.

112
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,610
- Were you eyeballing me?
- No, sir. There was a fly, sir.

113
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,060
Captain Bilal Siddiqui.

114
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,980
I've heard that people from
Lucknow are quite sensitive.

115
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,520
- Is that true?
- No, sir.

116
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,390
Better prove me wrong.

117
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,980
What's written on the wall?

118
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:21,530
Read what is written on the wall.

119
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,930
- We make men out of boys.
- We make men out of boys.

120
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,220
What would I make out of you?

121
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,170
What would I make out of you?

122
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,120
A commando, sir.

123
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,290
Bloody hell!

124
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,780
Because of this MOD meeting,
I missed my call.

125
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,380
And God only knows what bomb
she's going to drop on us today.

126
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,430
Fighting with a
politician is like...

127
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,010
...wrestling with a pig in the mud.

128
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,610
Even if you win, you lose.

129
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,840
What is...

130
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,390
- Morning, ma'am.
- Morning, ma'am.

131
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,700
Good morning.

132
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,970
Thank you.
[Clears throat]

133
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,790
Thank you for coming, Generals.

134
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,260
[Clears throat]

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,760
Ma'am, is this meeting about...

136
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,520
...the seventh pay commission's
anomalies or...

137
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,990
It's about something else,
General Raman.

138
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,960
Something which is
important than all this.

139
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,560
As you're aware,
on February 23rd, 2016...

140
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,280
...President Pranab Mukherjee
had announced in the parliament...

141
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,870
...that women too will be inducted
in combat roles.

142
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,430
Ma'am,
some things are easy to announce...

143
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,270
...but hard to enforce.

144
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,680
There are already lady officers in
combat roles in the navy and the air force.

145
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,620
Yes, ma'am...

146
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,910
As far as the IAF and navy go...

147
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,570
...you can't compare apples
to oranges, ma'am.

148
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,130
A fighter pilot is only responsible
for his own life.

149
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,290
Be it male or female.

150
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,650
But in a tank, where four people
stay in such a small place...

151
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,510
...they eat together,
sleep together...

152
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,150
They... Pardon my french, ma'am.
They even piss together.

153
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,480
And a lady...

154
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,920
What are you trying to say,
General Raman?

155
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,180
A woman can't handle that stress?

156
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,910
Or she can't take those
physical conditions?

157
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,030
Ma'am.

158
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,850
On the border,
imagine, if something untoward...

159
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,000
...happens with a lady...

160
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,400
...what will we do?

161
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,300
Will we handle her
security or the nation's?

162
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,430
Why did countries like
Australia, Canada and the US...

163
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,660
...didn't think about this while
accepting women for combat roles?

164
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,520
Our serving conditions
are very different.

165
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,700
The background from which
our soldiers come...

166
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,830
They've not
interacted with any woman..

167
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,370
..besides their mothers,
sisters, or wives.

168
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,890
And ma'am,
during a combat operation...

169
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,480
...stress levels are already high.

170
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,370
So, why should we add another
layer of tension?

171
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,720
That's your opinion.

172
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,940
It's not a fact.

173
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,380
I'm not saying that it's
going to be easy.

174
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,060
No. It's going to
be tough initially.

175
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,150
But this is the future, Generals.

176
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,710
Not just the future,
run down the memory lane.

177
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,790
Queen Laxmi Bai,
the one who fought a battle...

178
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,850
...with her child tied on her back.

179
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,390
Ma'am, if the question is of
equality of men and women...

180
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,290
...I would definitely
agree with the fact.

181
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,270
In fact, women...

182
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,210
Don't patronise me, General Raman.

183
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,140
Don't teach me about
women's capabilities.

184
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,310
Fair enough, ma'am.

185
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,700
But there's also
the issue of capture.

186
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,640
If a lady officers get captured...

187
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,080
...are you aware of the torture...

188
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,420
...they'd have to go through?

189
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,870
You have a point.

190
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,540
But patriotism doesn't
come with gender.

191
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,420
A women can tolerate
the same pain that a man can.

192
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,050
What is that Harvard study?

193
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,380
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,390
Gentlemen, according to a study
by Harvard university...

195
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,170
...a human body can only
withstand 45 units of pain.

196
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,910
But while delivering a baby...

197
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,860
..a woman feels up to
57 units of pain.

198
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,360
Just like 20 bones of your body
being crushed all at once.

199
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,780
That's the problem.

200
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,790
Wikipedia's articles, WhatsApp's
forwards and the entire world...

201
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,840
...believes anything.

202
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,950
Ma'am, why are we trying
to fix what's unbroken?

203
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,690
Because just like every other
established organisation...

204
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,680
..the army too avoids changes.

205
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,480
And General Bedi...

206
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,710
...now even naxalites and
jihadis are recruiting women.

207
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,520
Yes. They're also recruiting
five year olds.

208
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,860
Shall we do that too?

209
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,120
General Bedi...

210
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,880
Ma'am..

211
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,100
I request you to please read
Justice Khaitan's report.

212
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,710
She too was quite inconclusive
regarding this.

213
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:11,980
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

214
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,600
But the army is not politics.

215
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,620
Where one can get everything
through reservations.

216
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,750
And the fact that we've managed
to maintain such a high standard...

217
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,910
...is because we've just one basis.

218
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,740
And that is merit.

219
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,830
[Turning pages]

220
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,910
I agree.

221
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,910
Captain Shikhar Sharma,
age 28, army brat...

222
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,950
...state 5000 meters and
10,000 meters champion.

223
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,820
World class triathlete.

224
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,490
Had achieved sword
of honour in the academy.

225
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,830
Serving in military intelligence,
currently...

226
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,360
...has volunteered for special
forces training course.

227
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,360
You can see all the ACRs.

228
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,060
What do you think?

229
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,130
Should we give a chance
to Captain Shikhar Sharma?

230
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,770
Definitely.

231
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,220
Good.

232
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,830
Because actually,
her name is not Shikhar Sharma...

233
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,280
...it's Shikha Sharma.

234
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,330
And if Captain Shikha Sharma
passes this commando course...

235
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,110
...of the special forces...

236
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,330
..then, you'll have to
open your gates, gentlemen...

237
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,970
...to more women.

238
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,300
And to battles not between
the sexes...

239
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,610
...but battles that
shall be fought together.

240
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,200
Captain Shikha Sharma
will be our test case.

241
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,150
This is called a surgical strike.

242
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,290
I can't see the army being
butchered like this...

243
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,440
...in the name of gender politics.

244
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,850
I'm putting my papers down.

245
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,910
Relax, Bedi.

246
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,590
A good golfer has the
determination to win...

247
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,090
...and the patience
to wait for breaks.

248
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,610
This is the special forces,
and not a picnic.

249
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,960
Your backpacks are a
part of your skin...

250
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,390
...and the gun is a
part of your body.

251
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,510
These two should always
be there with you.

252
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,810
It doesn't matter if you're asleep,
awake, or in the bathroom.

253
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,700
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

254
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,440
- Louder.
- Yes, sir.

255
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,710
Ma'am.

256
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,220
There's a separate
arrangement for you.

257
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,380
After all, you can't stay
with them.

258
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,640
Sir, what do you call
the rest of the officers?

259
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,180
Sir, ma'am.

260
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,880
Call me the same.

261
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,910
Yes, ma'am.
Sir...

B*******d, look at him!

267
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,640
His father is a General and his
brother is an instructor here.

268
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,600
Didn't he get commissioned
in his father's unit?

269
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,860
He gives such intense looks,
he thinks he's a hero.

270
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,110
- Bhatti will get him on track.
- Yes.

271
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,970
I've heard that
he's quite hot-blooded.

272
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,310
Just like Nana Patekar
in the movie "Farar".

273
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,270
Do you always have to
use movie references?

274
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,100
Without films...

275
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,680
- Did you get parathas?
- Hey!

276
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,240
You're a Punjabi.
Did you bring phirnis?

277
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,570
- Yes.
- Really?

278
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,970
- Will you have it?
- Yes.

279
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,770
Bin.

280
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,390
Do you remember?
In the NDA too...

281
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,860
...we had beds right
next to each other.

282
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,390
Of course, bro.
Those were the days.

283
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,200
Always better in
hindsight, my friend.

284
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,090
Well, speaking of hind side...

285
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,390
...do you still have
the rash on your back?

286
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,440
Do you wish to scratch it?

287
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,170
That's a cute a*s.

288
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,110
Oh, bromance!
Love is in the air.

289
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,260
"Dostana 2".

290
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,820
There you said it.

291
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,910
Just like how a person who
got in through IMA would say.

292
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,140
We may be that but we
reached here on our own.

293
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,890
Be my guest, Tank.

294
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,550
I anyway liked that bed better.

295
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,840
Hey, Thapa,
please take the other bed.

296
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,110
- Okay.
- Thank you.

297
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,860
Who named you Tank?

298
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,320
No, I'm sure your parents didn't
name you Tank Chauhan.

299
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,680
Right?

300
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,930
Hello, ma'am.

301
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,830
Porn won't save your a*s in
the battlefield, my friend.

302
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:29,770
Not porn.

303
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,770
- This is my good luck charm.
- Is it?

304
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,400
First episode, bra salesman.

305
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,360
First published in November 2008.

306
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,540
Well, Mr. Rathore

307
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,890
If you think entry through
IMA is a forced entry..

308
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,310
- ...what is getting commission called
in your father's unit? - Merit.

309
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,110
Merit.
Forced entry!

310
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,700
Well, the real forced entry
is Captain Sharma.

311
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,340
A single dorm for all of us.

312
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,710
We need to bear the shoe stink
and snores of everyone.

313
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,050
And special room for her.

314
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,960
Is this a commando
course or a honeymoon?

315
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,480
Wait and watch, partner.

316
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,260
I don't know how many more rules
are going to be broken for her.

317
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,950
The one who will lose to her
will have it from me.

318
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,140
What if you lose?

319
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,820
Come on.
You know me better than that.

320
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,870
- No f*****g way.
- I can see that.

321
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,500
When will they call us for lunch?

322
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,690
You didn't get parathas also.

323
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,290
Good morning, sir.

324
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,720
At ease.

325
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,680
Captain Shikha Sharma,
Military Intelligence, Delhi Cantt.

326
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,850
Sent here directly by
Ministry of Defence as a test case.

327
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,050
Father,
Subedar Major Devichand Sharma.

328
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,210
12th OKRA.
My unit.

329
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,200
Has three sons.
But he sent you.

330
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,790
He didn't send me, sir.

331
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,420
I joined the army
because I wanted to, sir.

332
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,610
- Jhajhar Singh.
-[Jhajhar] 'Sir?'

333
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,280
What is the most common thing in
the list of these officers?

334
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,710
- All are men, sir.
- What?

335
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,080
- All are men, sir.
- Okay.

336
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,190
Captain Sharma.
I am not a misogynist.

337
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,830
I respect woman.

338
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,950
Especially the women
who reach their destination...

339
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,310
...not because of their gender
but because of their ability.

340
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,380
That's exactly the plan, sir.

341
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,900
I don't need any special
privileges from you.

342
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,250
It's too late for that, Capt.
Sharma.

343
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,010
You came here because of the direct
recommendation of a minister.

344
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,780
This is a special privilege
in its own.

345
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,230
You staying in an officers'
guesthouse is a special privilege.

346
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,130
A lady RMO being appointed
just for your sake...

347
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,100
Again a special privilege.

348
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,480
I didn't ask for any of it, sir.

349
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,890
Actually, I came to place
a request here, sir.

350
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,270
I want to stay in the dorm
along with the other officers.

351
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,810
Dismissed.

352
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,050
"- There was a beautiful girl.
- There was a beautiful girl."

353
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,760
"- A rifle man saw her.
- A rifle man saw her."

354
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,420
"- He forget to wipe the floor.
- He forget to wipe the floor."

355
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:53,090
"- Major saw him.
- Major saw him."

356
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,740
"- He punished him.
- He punished him."

357
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,460
"- The quartermaster was smart.
- The quartermaster was smart."

358
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,120
"- He cancelled the ration.
- He cancelled the ration."

359
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,260
"Badluram's body is beyond
the ground..."

360
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,980
- Good afternoon.
- Look who is here.

361
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,810
Good afternoon, ma'am.

362
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,810
Captains,
say hello to the military Barbie.

363
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,160
- Hello.
- Military Barbie.

364
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,120
- That's a new one. Hello.
- Is it?

365
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,040
- Please.
- Thank you.

366
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,410
You'll have to excuse
Rohan, he's a chauvinistic a*s.

367
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,470
Sorry, ma'am.

368
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,650
Oh, no.
Please don't ma'am me guys.

369
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,540
Shikha or Shiks will be great.

370
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,460
I'll feel a bit better.

371
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,180
Okay, Shikha.

372
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,590
- So, Capt. Shikha...
- Yes.

373
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,980
Since you are a part of us now...

374
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,980
...you will be welcomed
in a special way.

375
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,190
- Yeah.
- Right?

376
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,860
- Shall we have something sweet?
- Of course.

377
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:11,280
- This is phirni. I saved this
last one specially for you. - Yes.

378
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,060
Oh, God!

379
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,510
Have it...
Especially for you.

380
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,280
No.
I won't have this phirni again.

381
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,790
- That's pretty lame.
- So is this.

382
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,620
We need to fight for our name,
salt and target.

383
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,940
Salt being the operative
word there.

384
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,040
Sure but...
This is all you guys have?

385
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,140
There should be something tough.

386
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,110
Yeah, we have, Military Barbie.

387
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,920
Okay, let's see.
How long can you stare at...

388
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,980
- ...Surjewala's balls?
- Not cool, guys.

389
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,070
- No... I got this.
- Come on. Get up.

390
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,310
That's okay.
I know where they are.

391
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,890
Okay.

392
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,400
Come on, Surje.

393
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,650
Go for it, boy.

394
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,530
Eyeballs, right?

395
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,600
Nice.

396
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,690
- Beauty with brains.
- Smart.

397
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,340
Well, you do have balls.
For a woman.

398
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,310
Actually, I could never
understand this phrase.

399
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,600
Why do balls represent strength?

400
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,090
They are the weakest part of
a man's body. Right, Captain?

401
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,260
It hurts a lot.

402
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,340
The vagina, or p***y as you guys like to
call it, denoting a coward...

403
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,870
...is actually the strongest
part of a woman's body.

404
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,710
It pushes out an entire
human being.

405
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,510
It pushed you out, Capt. Rathore.

406
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,890
She nailed you, partner.

407
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,820
Now that's what I call
a vagina monologue.

408
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,790
- That's a good one, Capt. Avinash.
- Thank you, lady.

409
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,470
Please call me Avi.

410
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,190
All right, gentlemen.
I'll take your leave on that note.

411
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,380
- I just stopped by to say hello.
- Sure.

412
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,080
- Capt. Sharma.
- Yes?

413
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,040
Even I know how to drop punch lines.

414
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,390
You are a lady officer.
I respect you.

415
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,510
- That's why I didn't say more.
- Respect?

416
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,010
I have been hearing such
sexist comments...

417
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,260
...in the guise of chivalry
for many years, Captain.

418
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,010
And I am actually used
too much worse.

419
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,450
In OTA and in the unit...

420
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,230
So, please spare me your bullshit.

421
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,720
I am used to blocking such
noise since childhood.

422
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,570
But you seem to be a little
weak in this matter.

423
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,380
Why don't you focus on
your work instead of me?

424
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,890
Did someone see Colonel Sathe?
His phone is out of reach.

425
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,310
- I met him at the war memorial
a while ago. - Okay.

426
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,530
Please inform everyone
not to come near the main building.

427
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,520
We have a situation.

428
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,640
- What happened, Captain?
- Capt. Surjan is on the roof.

429
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,490
The door is locked and
he has a loaded weapon.

430
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,260
[Slamming the door]

431
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,960
Open the door.
[Slamming the door]

432
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,220
Open the door.

433
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,020
[Slamming the door]

434
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,150
[Door opening]

435
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,860
- Capt. Surjan.
- Back off.

436
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,400
Back off.
Or else, I'll shoot. It's loaded.

437
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:05,250
I won't step ahead without
your permission.

438
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,930
Where the hell is Colonel Sathe?

439
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,500
He's on his way.

440
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,290
Who...
Who are you?

441
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,400
- I'm in the new batch. Today
is my first day here. - What?

442
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,840
Lady officer in special forces?
Don't lie to me.

443
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,640
- Who are you?
- I'm not lying. I'm the first.

444
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,160
- And I'm here to help you.
- How?

445
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,380
To understand why you want
to risk your entire career.

446
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,020
I broke my ankle.

447
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,300
- I broke my ankle.
- I understand.

448
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,680
You don't understand.

449
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,780
I have only one motive, that is...

450
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,710
...to be an officer
of the special forces..

451
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,050
...and serve this flag.

452
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,250
This is the motive of everyone
present here.

453
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,380
So, I do understand.

454
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,950
Have you heard about Camp Dosaq?

455
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,600
That is the stress test
of our course.

456
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,890
Everything was fine till
the last hour of the last day.

457
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,420
I cleared everything.

458
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:24,150
But one stupid mistake
and I broke my ankle.

459
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,780
I hadn't spelt for 35 hours!
It could happen, okay?

460
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,630
I hadn't slept for f*****g 35 hours!

461
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,860
And they will declare me
medically unfit and send me back.

462
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,860
I told everyone in my battalion...

463
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,520
...that I'll be back after becoming
the special forces commando.

464
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,310
What will I tell them now?

465
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,070
- Are you sure he has only a glock?
- Yes, sir.

466
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,490
Jai Hind, sir.

467
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,150
Damn, Kripal.
He was the best of his batch.

468
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,120
He still has the ability.

469
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,950
-But... - That word has no place
in the special forces.

470
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,880
Only the toughest of the tough get
to wear the maroon beret.

471
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,430
[Shikha] 'You know the rules,
Captain.'

472
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,780
One injury can fail
the entire mission.

473
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,040
I can complete my operation
with this broken ankle.

474
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,740
I am a...
I am a special forces commando.

475
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,050
Not a bloody civilian!
Do you understand that?

476
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,850
I understand.

477
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,100
You can apply again next year.

478
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,600
You can still earn
your maroon beret.

479
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,330
Nothing is lost.
Nothing.

480
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:47,220
But if you pull that trigger,
your life will be ruined, Captain.

481
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,280
Please think about it.

482
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,710
I know.

483
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,440
I know.

484
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,300
I just want to meet
Colonel Sathe...

485
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,210
...and beg for one more chance.

486
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,890
Just one more chance.

487
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,320
- Go upstairs with Kamat.
- Sir.

488
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,930
- Go this way.
- Okay.

489
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,210
- Kamat.
- Jhajhar Singh. - Sir.

490
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,400
Please hand me the weapon.

491
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,890
Is one more chance too much to ask?

492
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,430
Please hand me your weapon.

493
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,480
Thank you, Captain.
Thank you.

494
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,140
Captain Surjan.
Come down.

495
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,890
Immediately.
Can you hear me?

496
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,350
Captain.

497
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,360
Give up your weapon and come down.

498
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,130
- Captain.
- Surjan.

499
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,840
- Captain.
- If you don't come...

500
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,000
...I'll have to take
disciplinary action.

501
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,690
Drop the weapon.

502
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:11,220
Drop the weapon, Captain.
Drop it.

503
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,060
Your first day was quite eventful.

504
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,670
How did others behave with you?
Sit up, please.

505
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,910
Some were good,
some were a little weird.

506
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,000
But no one was normal.

507
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,490
Rotate for me.

508
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,380
This is a crazy way
to meet someone...

509
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,620
...for the first
time, Capt. Sharma.

510
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,890
- Please call me Shikha.
- Aparna.

511
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,960
You have been posted here
just for my sake.

512
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,040
I hope you are not
upset about that.

513
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:18,760
Of course not.

514
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,810
I got a chance to serve in SFTC
because of you.

515
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,990
Anyway,
I wanted to meet that crazy girl...

516
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,880
...who wants to be an example.

517
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,340
No pressure.

518
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,490
But the future of all the girls of
this country is in your hands.

519
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,690
Thanks.

520
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,640
Okay.

521
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,890
Just some bruising.
No broken ribs.

522
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,030
Okay.
Thank God.

523
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,860
Or else, they'd have sent me back
before the course could even start.

524
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,390
You can wear your shirt now.

525
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,660
Tell me one thing.

526
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,910
What were you thinking
when you went up there?

527
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,710
[Gunshot]

528
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,160
Actually, something similar
has happened before.

529
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,860
And I couldn't do anything
at that time.

530
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,000
Excuse me, ma'am.

531
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,210
Colonel Sathe has called you.

532
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,300
Afternoon, sir.

533
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:02,210
You are trying to get on my nerves
from the very first day. Isn't it?

534
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,310
Who gave you the permission
to go upstairs?

535
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,960
Are you trained to handle such
situations, Capt. Sharma?

536
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,290
Permission to speak freely, sir?

537
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,190
Granted.
At ease.

538
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,010
I'm very sorry, sir.

539
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,180
I reacted with my instinct and gut
at the time of crisis, sir.

540
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,060
But please correct If I'm wrong.

541
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,150
But SF commandoes
are trained to do the same.

542
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,240
You are not yet a
commando, Capt. Sharma.

543
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,940
You are far from it.

544
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,000
Do you even realise...

545
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,160
...that I can throw
you out of the academy...

546
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,140
...because of this behaviour
of yours?

547
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,140
Yes, sir.

548
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,920
But I won't do it.
It'll be too easy.

549
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,350
I don't have to work
too hard for that.

550
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,310
You will go on your own.

551
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,260
You won't be able to
complete the course.

552
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,140
I beg to differ, sir.

553
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,070
You really think you are a
special case, don't you?

554
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,520
No, sir.

555
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,020
Then what?
A nutcase?

556
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,160
- No, sir. - Then who the
hell do you think you are?

557
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,150
The test case, sir.

558
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,900
[Notification sound]

559
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,160
[Theme music playing]

560
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,940
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

561
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,680
My apologies, Capt. Sharma.

562
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,830
Military Intelligence Directorate
has been on my a*s...

563
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,000
...to take this from you.

564
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Sir, this will be my last job
for the MI.

565
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,770
It has the intel
of the terrorist sleeper cell, sir.

566
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,640
I hope you get the b******s, sir.

567
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,860
I hope so too.

568
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,110
Well, is your commander,
Colonel Sathe aware...

569
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,060
...that you are here?
- Sir, had he known...

570
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:55,160
...I would have been going home
by a Haryana Roadways bus.

571
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,040
And if this was not
a time sensitive handover...

572
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,930
...I wouldn't have risked jumping
the academy fence on the first day.

573
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:04,460
If anyone deserves to be
the first woman in combat...

574
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,970
...and in special forces...

575
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,170
...it's definitely you.

576
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,970
Thank you very much, sir.
Really good to see you.

577
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,110
- Good to see you too.
- I'll take your leave.

578
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,320
- Night, sir. Sir.
- Good night.

579
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
[Engine starting]

580
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,030
[Bhatti] 'Where the training
of the army ends...'

581
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,280
[Bhatti] '...the training
of the special forces begins.

582
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,040
Without sleep, water, or food...

583
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,260
...you'll fight against
your enemy and win.

584
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,330
From today, with every drill...

585
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,790
...our leader board
will be updated.

586
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:50,090
After 8 weeks, many officers
among you will pass out...

587
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,270
...and become entitled
to the maroon beret.

588
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,310
But only one of you,
who tops this course...

589
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,690
...will get that special
commando dagger.

590
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,330
- Did you get my point?
- Yes, sir...

591
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,700
[Whistle]

592
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,680
[Bhatti] 'Those who sweat
in peace...'

shed blood in war.'

00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,480
[Bhatti] 'Your body will
get tired, you will lose hope...'

595
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,000

out of breath...'

596
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,250
[Bhatti] '...but
you must not stop.'

597
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,220
Speed up.

598
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,250
Come on.
Hurry up...

599
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,300
Hurry up...

600
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,800
Hurry up...
This is special forces. Buck up!

601
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,040
Jai Hind.

602
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,680
Jai Hind, sir.

603
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,440
Jai Hind, sir.

604
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,420
The cut-off of this obstacle
was 7 minutes.

605
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:02,730
Capt. Tank, you completed it
in 5 minutes and 7 seconds.

606
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,970
Congratulations.

607
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,760
You are in the first position.

608
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,760
Capt. Manit.

609
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,480
You are in the second position.
Very good.

610
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,650
And Capt. Sharma,
what do we do with you?

611
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,250
I think we have to make
a new obstacle course for you.

612
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,500
- No, sir. I'll do it, sir.
- When?

613
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,540
Your upper body strength
might be better than other girls.

614
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,270
But special force training doesn't
differentiate between genders.

615
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,990
Anyway, here in SFTC
there is a special principle.

616
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:36,230
No matter who makes the mistake...

617
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:38,300
...everybody gets punished.

618
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:43,690
Until Capt. Sharma completes
this obstacle within 7 minutes...

619
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,230
...everyone will get
limited ration.

620
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,490
Lack of food.

621
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,780
- Did you get it?
- Yes, sir...

622
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:54,260
F*****g told you, man.

623
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,100
All of us will be in trouble
because of her.

624
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,190
Yes, dude.

625
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:59,190
- Manit, S***e.
- Hey, Avinash.

626
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:00,400
I am from the Garuds!

627
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,760
What's up, my friend...

628
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,330
- My friend. How are you?
- Very well.

629
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:06,520
- You've impressed everyone here.
- Always, brother.

630
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,820
Superb, man!

631
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,000
By the way, have you met
the legendary Capt. Rathore?

632
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,500
I met him in the mess,
very briefly.

633
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:16,360
- Hi. - You hold a good reputation
in the regiment.

634
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,770
- Good to finally meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

635
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,730
Rohan, your friend
is improving, dude.

636
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,110
Shikha.

637
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,950
I mean, Capt. Sharma.

638
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:30,450
You too, man.

639
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,470
You were together in NDA, right?

640
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:36,960
Yes, we were.
People’s priorities change.

641
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,490
- You okay?
- I hope this is not sympathy.

642
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,680
Because that will make me
feel like an outsider.

643
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:45,890
Not at all.

644
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:47,580
It's...

645
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:48,910
It's support.

646
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:51,000
Believe me.

647
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:53,600
I know what it feels like
to be an outsider.

648
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,720
My name is Bilal Siddiqui.

649
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,300
That is why I joined the army.

650
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,920
Because here,
things just don't matter.

651
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:02,320
Are you getting me?

652
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:06,190
Call me Shikha, Bilal.

653
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,060
I'll do that.

654
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,160
See you.

655
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,070
- See you at dinner. Bye.
- Sure.

656
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,550
Read what is written on the wall.

657
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,340
- We make men out of boys.
- We make men out of boys!

658
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:24,610
What would I make out of you?

659
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,760
I swear on Sunny Leone.
My stomach is growling.

660
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,300
I am famished.
Lack of food is killing me.

661
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,170
You have the solution
for your hunger.

662
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,260
What?

663
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,160
- Eat Ms. Savita.
- S***e.

664
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:15,880
It sounds so wrong.

665
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,180
Hey, come on.

666
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,580
Banta, your Santa is here.
And look what I got.

667
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,770
- Look.
- You thief! What is this?

668
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,150
I convinced the guard.

669
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,360
And Capt. Manit got food from CSD.

670
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,750
One minute...
First, repeat after me.

671
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:30,930
- I am from the Garuds.
- Say, my friend...

672
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,620
- Ahead.
- Always ahead..

673
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,150
- Ahead.
- Always ahead..

674
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:36,950
- Victory to...
- India...

675
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,730
Slowly.
Everyone will get it.

676
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:43,300
Move..

677
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,190
- Did you finish the food?
- Yes, Dad.

678
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:49,170
Good girl.

679
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:51,060
I told your mother...

680
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,580
...that you won't do homework
on the weekends. Okay?

681
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,740
-'Love you, Dad.'
- I love you too, baby.

682
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:57,730
Bye.

683
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,360
You've changed a lot
after marriage.

684
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,780
No, dude.

685
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,840
I think it’s becoming a dad
that changes you.

686
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,310
You'll know it one day.

687
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:13,330
Your entire focus is on your kid.

688
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,650
I mean..
You become so protective.

689
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,740
Even if there is a mosquito
in the room...

690
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,360
...you will be worried
that it might bite your daughter.

691
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:25,360
- Dad of the year 2017.
- No, dude.

692
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:29,570
All the mosquitoes and flies
remind me of our dearest Bilal.

693
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,250
- Were you winking at me?
- Were you eyeballing me?

694
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,940
No, sir.
There was a fly, sir.

695
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,600
By the way, where is Bilal?

696
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,030
Where do you think?

697
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:45,870
15.

698
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,410
16.

699
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,020
Hey.

700
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:55,850
Hi.

701
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,860
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

702
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:06,100
I thought you could use
some reinforcements.

703
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,310
Are you sure?

704
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,100
Thank you.

705
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:21,050
But I don't want
to break more rules.

706
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:26,080
I see! So, you have
already broken a rule.

707
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,910
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

708
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:40,300
Why are you...
Why are you killing yourself?

709
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,680
Bilal, if I don't complete
this obstacle course...

710
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,000
...Bhatti will throw me
out of here...

711
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,500
...saying,
"Carry on, Capt. Sharma."

712
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:56,190
I have to give it everything.

713
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,460
It's do or die, Bilal.

714
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,120
Is it important to prove a point
always and every time?

715
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,160
Always and every time.

716
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,000
"The motive of my life
is to protect my country."

717
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:18,730
"India is in my heart."

718
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:24,400
"I am not weak
nor less than anyone."

719
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:29,530
"I don't mind sacrificing my life."

720
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:34,930
"I am proud to say
that the tricolour is my life."

721
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:38,830
"India is in my heart."

722
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:44,960
"India is in my heart."

723
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:51,070
"India is in my heart."

724
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,680
Check.

725
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,460
I am hungry.

726
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,940
Eating a few biscuits
doesn't help at all.

727
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,080
No problem.

728
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,250
It's a matter of one day.

729
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,910
Tomorrow, she will fail again.

730
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:18,300
There will be no more
food shortage.

731
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:20,560
No, dude.

732
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,350
She is strong.

733
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:24,660
And I have a feeling
that she will do it.

734
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,800
- Let's bet for Rs. 2,000.
- Sure.

735
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,830
Even I am in.
She won't be able to do it.

736
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,400
- Dude.
- She will do it.

737
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,380
- Right?
- Let's see.

738
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,950
You came here because of a
minister's direct recommendation

739
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,020
This is a special privilege
by itself.

740
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:45,390
Say hello to the Military Barbie.

741
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,370
Girls cannot become
a commando in the army.

742
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:49,780
No pressure.

743
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:52,990
But the future of all the girls
of this country is in your hands.

744
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,870
I don't have to work
too hard for it.

745
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,570
You will leave willingly.

746
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,110
Only 20 are left.

747
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,720
Capt. Sharma.

748
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,260
We are giving you
the last chance today.

749
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:16,200
If you fail,
your exit form is ready.

750
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,830
But this time, the difficulties
will be doubled.

751
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,650
You will be carrying a load
of 10 kilograms...

752
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:23,000
...from the start.

753
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:26,470
Because the weak
have no place here.

754
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,150
- Did you get it?
- Yes, sir.

755
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,230
Dude, I think I'll lose my money.

756
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:35,810
Keep Rs. 2,000 ready.

757
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,780
[Whistle]

758
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:33,960
Come on, Capt. Sharma.

759
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:36,630
It's easy to go home.

760
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:38,370
But do you want to go home?

761
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,280
Try!

762
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:26,580
Come on...

763
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:28,920
You shouldn't stop.
Pull yourself.

764
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,660
Jai Hind, sir.

765
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:51,530
[Footsteps]

766
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:06,940
Done.

767
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:14,520
At ease.

768
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,840
7 minutes and 10 seconds.

769
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,360
But you completed this course
carrying a load of 10 kilograms.

770
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,270
So, according to our principles...

771
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,390
...you are given 20 seconds extra.

772
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,240
And because of this...

773
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,080
...you are safe from getting
disqualified by 10 seconds.

774
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:48,160
Congratulations, Capt. Sharma.

775
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,330
I think there is still time
for you to go home.

776
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:51,400
Thank you, sir.

777
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:53,900
Go and have food.

778
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,090
The food is served for all of you.

779
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,090
Well, no matter what we say...

780
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:00,920
...but she has an X-factor.

781
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,840
That is why she won the bet.

782
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:06,420
- What say, hero?
- For sure. Well... For sure.

783
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,510
Capt. Rathore.

784
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:10,870
You lost the bet.

785
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:12,930
Hand me the money.

786
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:14,960
Are we allowed to get wallet here?
I'll give it to you in the dorm.

787
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,290
- Good evening, boys.
- Good evening.

788
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,870
I heard about a bet...

789
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:22,120
...that I won't be able
to complete the obstacle course.

790
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,620
It's between the boys
so I don't want to interfere.

791
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,720
But I feel bad
for the ones who lost.

792
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,530
Just cut the crap, Capt. Sharma.
All right?

793
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,820
Capt. Rathore.
Listen to what she has to say.

794
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,320
Dude...
No offence to anyone.

795
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,760
But I just want to say
that people should stay focused.

796
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:41,860
Focus on the leader board.
Forget about betting.

797
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:43,950
- Isn't it?
- Of course.

798
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,430
- Won't you get me a beer?
- Of course.

799
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:48,180
- I made you win.
- Come on.

800
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,670
- Come on.
- Bilal, you coming?

801
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,810
You'll be paying the bill.

802
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:54,900
Come...

803
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,570
Sir.

804
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:02,290
Bar brawl with the police.
Right?

805
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:08,210
Got any explanations?

806
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,900
Sir, I was in Mhow.

807
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:11,760
I had completed
the Junior Command Course.

808
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,080
They were goons from Meerut.

809
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,930
They were teasing my friend.
So, I..

810
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,320
I just gave it back.

811
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,720
But what do I do
about the FIR, Capt. Avinash?

812
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:31,800
Look.

813
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,780
Maybe everyone does...

814
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,060
...what you did.

815
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:40,220
But this is SFTC.
And we go by rules.

816
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:43,570
I can't have someone in the academy
who has a police case on him.

817
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,470
Finish your court case.

818
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,710
And volunteer next year once again.

819
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:55,110
Sir, please.
Reconsider it.

820
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,470
Rules are rules, Capt. Avinash.

821
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:59,430
- Sir...
- All the best.

822
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:04,750
Dismissed.

823
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,550
One more thing, Capt. Avinash.

824
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,110
During the punishment
of lack of food...

825
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,690
...food items from CSD canteen
were taken to the dorm.

826
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:21,780
Am I right?

827
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:26,520
- Yes.
- We are watching, always.

828
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,510
While leaving, explain this
to your course mates.

829
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,690
[Ranjit] 'Who must have
named him Tank?'

830
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:41,230
- I heard his name is Tankesh.
- Tankesh?

831
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,610
I prefer Tankinder.

832
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:47,470
But he is good.

833
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,330
He remains silent
when everybody laughs.

834
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:50,780
And when everyone cries,
he laughs.

835
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:53,410
Dude, I am feeling bad for Avinash.

836
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,820
He was a good lad.
He had to leave for no reason.

837
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,680
He always gets into trouble.

838
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:01,370
I think that Military Barbie
is behind this.

839
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:03,600
Military Barbie.

840
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,810
We successfully maintained
our first week's record.

841
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,880
Four have signed exit forms.

842
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,720
- But she is still here.
- Yes, sir.

843
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,410
We have underestimated her.

844
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,480
She trained herself every night.

845
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,900
And completed
the obstacle course today.

846
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:32,550
- Sir, I wanted to ask something.
- Yes.

847
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,460
Do we have to be
so strict with her?

848
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,130
Mr. Bhatti, how long have you
been posted in SFTC?

849
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:48,700
Eight years, sir.

850
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:51,440
But you never asked me
this question in 8 years.

851
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:52,920
Regarding another officer.

852
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:02,930
One more thing.

853
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:15,190
Capt. Shikha Sharma
had requested...

854
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:17,560
...not to be given
any special treatment.

855
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,240
But this has never happened, sir.

856
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:26,380
That is because
a lady officer never applied...

857
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:29,190
...to become
a special forces commando.

858
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,680
F**k.

859
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:05,920
What kind of a joke is this?

860
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,720
Colonel Sathe's orders.

861
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:11,120
I just have to find myself
a bed now.

862
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:12,480
Welcome, Shikha.

863
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:14,350
By the way, we have a rule here.

864
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:17,630
You'll have to compete
with the heavy drinker here...

865
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,870
...in order to get a bed.

866
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:26,450
Who is that?

867
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:32,030
I am.

868
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,190
Okay.

869
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,190
Come on...

870
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,400
Well done.
Wonderful.

871
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,090
Come on, Shikha.

872
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:47,000
Come on, Rohan.

873
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,920
[Applauding and cheering]

874
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:52,880
You must not stop.

875
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:55,940
Wow!
Look at his style. Wow.

876
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:57,380
Wonderful!

877
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,520
Come on...

878
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:02,320
- Finish this.
- Rohan, come on!

879
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:13,500
Dude!

880
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,730
Come on, Shikha.
Come on.

881
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:17,410
How much will you drink
to prove a point?

882
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:23,540
Let it be, Capt. Sharma.

883
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:27,450
Anyway, only men and horses
can digest rum.

884
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,310
Where are the horses that drink rum?

885
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,570
- Wonderful!
- Point.

886
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,280
He was the only heavy drinker here
but now she has arrived.

887
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:38,620
Hey!

888
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:41,560
And I am saying this to you
with due respect, ma'am.

889
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:44,650
Okay.
Come on, Surje.

890
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,150
- Very good!
- Come on...

891
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:51,450
[Cheering]

892
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,550
Go, Rohan.

893
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:00,140
I think Capt. Sharma
is about to give up.

894
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,120
The game has just begun.

895
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,250
Capt. Sharma, come on.
You can do this.

896
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:07,550
[Man] Come on.

897
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:11,140
Come on, Shikha.
Come on...

898

[Applauding and cheering]

899
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:14,760
Come on...

900
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,560
- Come on...
- Well done...

901
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:18,200
Come on...

902
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:19,180
Shikha!

903
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:27,530
[Bilal] Hey. Here.
Have some water.

904
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:32,670
As the saying goes,
a single blow of a blacksmith...

905
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,290
Is equivalent to a hundred blows
of a goldsmith...

906
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,390
- I am impressed, Rohan.
- Let's go...

907
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:42,410
Hey...

908
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,080
To the floor, Barbie.

909
01:04:50,450 --> 01:04:51,860
Aye aye, Captain!

910
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:57,020
Cheers, boys.
Capt. Sharma has lost the battle.

[Cheering]

912
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,030
I think you had too much
last night.

913
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,490
As all of you know...

914
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:53,260
...the Krav Maga of the Israelis...

915
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:56,100
...is one of the best
martial art forms in the world.

916
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:58,030
In the special forces...

917
01:05:58,210 --> 01:05:59,830
...hand to hand combat...

918
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,560
...is more important than weapons.

919
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,310
Capt. Rohan Rathore.

920
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:21,060
Brigade of the Guards,
IMA, NDA.

921
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,840
- Do you remember their rule?
- Yes, sir.

922
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:27,130
Then, take 20 rounds.
Buddy piggyback.

923
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,360
Everything will be all right.

924
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:35,340
As per the rules
of special forces...

925
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,290
...the commandos holding alternate
positions on the leader board...

926
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:38,640
...are buddies.

927
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:42,990
So according to that...
Capt. Manit!

928
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,580
- You are Capt. Rohan's buddy.
- Yes, sir.

929
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:49,120
Come on.
Fulfil your responsibility.

930
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,240
Rathore, don't we look like
Vikram and Betal?

931
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:01,300
F**k your PJs man, Manit.

932
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:02,650
My head is aching.

"You broke your silence,
so I'll fly away now."

934
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,740
Are you done
or do you have more to say?

935
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:11,020
There is more.
Eight more rounds to go.

936
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,870
Who asked you to show off?

937
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,470
You drank
one and a half bottle of liquor.

938
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:16,360
I wanted to show her, her place.

939
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,360
Yeah. But she showed you,
your place instead.

940
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,560
What the f**k are you
talking about?

941
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,470
- Don't you see what everyone can?
- What?

942
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,080
She played you, partner.

943
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:26,210
She laid a trap
and you fell into it.

944
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,950
Capt. Rathore,
are you tired already?

945
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,740
You shouldn't stop.

a lady officer has been sent..."

"...for a commando course
in the special forces."

"...has left everyone speechless."

- Good morning, sir.
- Morning, Colonel.

You must have heard
the breaking news.

954
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,210
Apparently you and I
are speechless...

01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:14,030
...after seeing
Shikha Sharma's performance.

956
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:16,760
[Bedi] 'Anyway, how is she doing?'

957
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:21,100
In physical strength, the male
officers are better than her.

958
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,690
But in shooting,
Capt. Sharma is quite strong.

959
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,120
[Sathe] 'She thinks calmly.'

960
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:28,510
After failing in the obstacle task,
she has come back really strong.

961
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,340
You are praising her,
Colonel Sathe.

962
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:36,570
General Bedi,
you know me very well.

963
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,010
I won't praise anyone
without any reason.

964
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:40,810
And I won't criticise her...

965
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,180
...just because she
is a lady officer.

966
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:44,050
[Sathe] 'I am just
telling you the facts.'

967
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:47,290
The areas in which
most women would give up...

968
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,850
...she is doing much better
than what I expected.

969
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:51,750
[Sathe] 'However, sir.'

970
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,560
From next week, strategy and
tactics training is going to start.

971
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:55,950
Under Freddie, right?

972
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:56,900
Yes, sir.

973
01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:58,510
Under Colonel Freddie Punawala.

974
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:01,580
[Sathe] 'You know that not
everyone can do this.'

975
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,710
Also Camp Dozakh is pending.

976
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,990
She might clear
the tactics course...

977
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:07,670
...but it won't be possible
for her...

978
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:09,900
...to clear Dozakh.

979
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,440
Are you sure?

980
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:16,540
The failure rate of male officers
is 40 percent, sir.

981
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:18,820
Remember, Colonel.

982
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:20,900
This is not just
about Shikha Sharma.

983
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:23,650
This is about the future
of the army.

984
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:29,240
I just want our benchmark
to be the same.

985
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:30,700
[Bedi] 'You know what I am saying.'

986
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:32,250
Push her the hardest.

987
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:33,250

is to protect my country."

"I am not weak
nor less than anyone."

"I don't mind sacrificing my life."

995

that tricolour is my life."

"India is in my heart."

999
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:38,700
Come on, Commandos.
Come on.

1000
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,020
Well done, Officers!

1001
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,710
Capt. Manit.

1002
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,650
Because of your good performance...

1003
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:20,060
...you are moving up
on the leader board.

1004
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,050
Capt. Rohan.

1005
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:25,770
Being disciplined is also important
apart from good performance...

1006
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,280
...for the leader board positions.

1007
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,680
Capt. Sharma,
keep up the good work.

1008
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,020
That's all for today.

1009

Good news comes without warning
in the special forces.

1010
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,910
You can go anywhere you want
for six hours this evening.

1011
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,430
You can do what you want.

1012
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:44,240
But tomorrow morning at 5...

1013
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:45,550
...be ready for the fall in.

1014
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:48,180
Okay.
Dismissed.

1015
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,240
Guys, hurry up.

1017
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:09,630
How will you manage today,
Capt. Shikha?

1018
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:12,290
The bus will leave in 15 minutes.

1019
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:13,680
Hurry up.

1020
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,640
[Man2] 'Hurry up.
There is poor water pressure.'

1021
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,550
What will you do?
What is your plan?

1022
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:31,430
Surje.
You are taking a bath today.

1023
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,930
- I took a bath on Thursday.
- Is it?

1024
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,450
- Mr. Bilal.
- Yes.

1025
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:37,510
How long are you going
to bathe?

1026

[Door knocking]

1027
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,170
F**k it.

1028
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:54,530
No...

1029
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:15,860
What happened, Manit?

1030
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,650
Hurry up.
The bus will leave in 14 minutes.

1031
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,740
Okay.
This is good.

1032
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:22,830
What happened, Surje?
What are you looking at?

1033
01:14:24,230 --> 01:14:25,370
- Tell me.
- No...

1034
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,430
What?

1035
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,090
It's the same.
Like your mother and your sister.

1036
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:32,000
Your daughter would be the same.

1037
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,110
I'm using a filmy dialogue
to explain to you.

1038
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,550
It's just anatomy.
Get used to it.

1039
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,960
I'll get used to it.

1040
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:43,710
Sorry, I didn't want to offend you.

1041
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:46,220
It's okay.
Fair enough.

1042
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,750
Actually, everyone
has their own fantasy.

1043
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:52,580
- That's why I...
- Stop it now.

1044
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,850
Now, I might really get offended.

- Are you army officers?
- Yeah.

1048
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:15,580
Okay.

1049
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,240
What is the matter?
Time for some cocktail?

1050
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:26,220
- Nice shot.
- It was easy.

1051

Did you talk to Avinash?

1052
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:31,660
He must be fine.

1053

1057
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:44,630

Don't worry, dude.

1060
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:55,100
I too have made arrangements.

1074

Excuse me.

1078
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:46,220
In Bollywood,
there's a villain named Ranjit.

1079
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:51,060
And Capt. Surjewala's father
is a very big fan of Ranjit.

1080
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,690
That is why he named
his son after him.

1081
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:57,630
Well, I must say.

1082
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,430
Manit is quite charming.

1083
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:04,610
- Why? - Where did he find
such cute girls in Kolipad?

1084
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:07,120

Which one do you like?

1086
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,990
The one wearing the floral dress
or the one wearing the tan dress?

1087
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:15,560
Both are hot.
But...

1088
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,780
What's wrong with you?

1089
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,870
I am in the army
and I fire weapons.

1090
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:27,380
Does it mean I am into girls?

1091
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:30,720
- What a sad stereotype...
- No...

1092
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,000
No... Dude.
That is not what I meant.

1093
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:37,430
It's just that I never saw a girl
complimenting another girl.

1094
01:17:37,530 --> 01:17:39,120
Here you go.
One more stereotype.

1095
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:41,520
I also gave a compliment
to the man.

1096
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:44,090
Yeah. And I don't think
she is into girls.

1097
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:46,130
There you go.
See.

And here I was thinking...

1102
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:57,820
...that I am number one
on your personal leadership board.

1103
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,460
- Thanks, bro.
- Hard luck, bro.

the right room number?

- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Perfect.

1117

1118

01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,910
And we call it...

1222
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:19,830
...Camp Dozakh.

1223
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:25,600
You won't forget the next 36 hours
for the rest of your life.

1224
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:29,710
Because Dozakh means netherworld.

1225
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:31,970
Hell.

1226
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:35,060
I just have one suggestion
for all of you.

1227
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:37,130
If you are going through hell...

1228
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:39,040
...just keep going.

1229
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:41,470
I think we are done for.

1230
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,360
The first stage of Dozakh.

1231
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:46,330
Night march for 30 kilometres...

1232
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,710
...carrying a load of 30 kilograms
and your weapons.

1233
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,360
Keep walking.

1234
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,650
Come on, Commandos.
Do not stop. Keep going.

1235
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:09,930
Keep walking.

1236
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:15,880
Everyone, sit down.

1237
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:18,930
Sit...

1238
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:21,020
Sit properly.
Is there any doubt?

1239
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,130
Lift your weapons.

1240
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:27,410
Advance! Come on...

1241
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:32,630
One, two...
Move...

1242
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:35,960
Keep going..
No other moves.

1243
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,740
What are you looking at?
Come on. Move ahead.

1244
01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:01,220
So, are you not able to do it?

1245
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:05,820
Come on.

1246

[Devichand] 'Buck up. Good...'

1248
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:17,940
Try harder.

1249
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:19,850
[Devichand] 'Try harder.'

1250
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,730
Don't you want to join the army?

1251
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:24,580
[Devichand] 'Don't you want
to become a commando?'

1252
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:27,350
My back is hurting, Dad.

1253
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:29,730
If you bear this pain now,
later you won't face any trouble.

1254
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:32,070
- Lift this up.
- No, Dad. - Lift.

1255
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:34,580
Even I want to become
a commando, Dad.

1256
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:39,010
Dear, girls cannot
become commandos in the army.

1257
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:40,310
But girls do join the army,
right?

1258
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:41,820
He doesn't even
want to join the army.

1259
01:28:41,890 --> 01:28:43,990
- Why don't you let me do it?
- You..

1260
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:45,890
- Let her do it.
- Stay quiet.

1261
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:49,320
What are you laughing at?

1262
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,590
She lifted it up.
And you are not able to lift it.

1263
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:53,050
Is this how you will join the army?

1264
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:54,210
Come on. Lift it up.

1265
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:55,950
Try harder.

1266
01:28:57,310 --> 01:28:58,180
And you!

1267
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,310
You have become too talkative.

1268
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,310
Control your tongue.

1269
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,240
Very good.
You have to join the army.

1270
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,710
[Naved] 'Come on.
Sign this form and go back.'

1271
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,790
[Siren]

1272
01:29:30,910 --> 01:29:32,000
[Bhatti] 'Be it right or wrong...'

1273
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,310
[Bhatti] '...this is the future
of war, Captains.'

1274
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:36,010
Chemical warfare.

1275
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:39,890
[Footsteps]

1276
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:41,620
[Door opening]

1277
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:43,770
[Bhatti] You will find
chlorobenzylidene malononitrile...

1278
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:45,510
[Bhatti] ...inside the building.

1279
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:48,400
[Bhatti] In short,
it is called CS gas.

1280
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:53,040
[Bhatti] Even the American army
use this in their training.

1281
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,610
[Bhatti] You will perform
this task with your buddy.

1282
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:01,940
[Bhatti] Remember one thing.

1283
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:04,380
[Bhatti] If you don't complete
this task in 2 minutes...

1284
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:07,030
[Bhatti] ...your buddy
might lose his life.

1285
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:13,270
[Bhatti] You will get to know
the value of every breath...

1286
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:14,970
[Bhatti] ...while doing this task.

1287
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:21,290
[Coughing]

1288
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,500
[Bhatti] Both the buddies
will have to breath carefully.

1289
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:25,800
[Bhatti] If you
inhale more oxygen...

1290
01:30:26,210 --> 01:30:28,590
[Bhatti] ...your buddy might not
get enough oxygen to breathe.

1291
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:31,310
You can at least share the oxygen.

1292
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:43,490
[Bhatti] If the oxygen gets over
before the task ends...

1293
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:45,880
[Bhatti] ...you'll fail the test.

1294
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:48,410
Get up.

1295
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:51,590
- Get up.
- God!

1296
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:53,860
Rohan.
Buddy.

1297
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,430
Are you all right?

1298
01:30:56,950 --> 01:30:59,830
Rohan, are you all right?
What is happening?

1299
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,940
Rohan, what is happening?

1300
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:09,210
Rohan, don't fall.
Are you all right?

1301
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,840
We need help.
Guys!

1302
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:13,740
Guy...

1303
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:15,340
Rohan.

1304
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:17,870
Are you all right, Rohan?
What happened, Rohan?

1305
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:23,800
Rohan...
No...

1306
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:27,750
Rohan...
Rohan!

1307
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:32,240
Rohan...

1308
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:33,390
Rohan.

1309
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:37,140
Rohan...

1310
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,860
Get up.
Get up, Rohan...

1311
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:45,480

1313
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:00,030
F**k!

1314
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:05,130
Sorry, man. Manit.

1315
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,310
S***e, had something happened
to you or me today...

1316
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:08,710
...because
of your claustrophobia...

1317
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:10,310
...even your dad wouldn't
have been able to do anything.

1318
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,410
F**k, dude.
B******d.

1319
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,160
[Coughing]

1320
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:23,670
Are you all right, buddy?

1321
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:28,140
Thanks, Bilal.
I have my own buddy.

1322
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,340
We first need to win the battle
within, Capt. Rohan.

1323
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:41,590
Got it?

1324
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:44,130
In this way you will put
yourself, your buddy...

1325
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:45,730
...and the entire unit in danger.

1326
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:47,880
Give up your dream
of becoming a commando.

1327
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:52,960
Listen, dear. I know
this was your father's dream.

1328
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,060
This isn't dad's dream.
This is my dream.

1329
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,850
I wanted Udit to fulfil
this dream of mine.

1330
01:32:57,950 --> 01:33:00,040
But I know what
brother went through.

1331
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,190
Dad, you have no idea.

1332
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:05,520
Brother never wanted
to join the army.

1333
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:07,490
You always forced him.

1334
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,450
Now that I want to join the army...

1335
01:33:09,530 --> 01:33:11,330
...you are trying to stop me.

1336
01:33:12,150 --> 01:33:15,210
We all saw the impact
of your stubbornness on brother.

1337
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:20,790
- Now, don't try the same
thing on me. - Shikha!

1338
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:25,500
What type of girl are you?
Don't you want to get married?

1339
01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:29,730
And we're ready to let you
marry the guy you like.

1340
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:33,040
- And you!
- Yes.

1341
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:36,540
- Will you marry her?
- Yes.

1342
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:39,540
Dad, I don't want
to get married now.

1343
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:42,510
I want to finish my graduation
and then join the army, Dad.

1344
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,290
You want to roam around
with your boyfriend...

1345
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:46,430
...and join the army.
Wow!

1346
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:48,830
You are my daughter. Don't try
to become equivalent to my son.

1347
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,200
- Hasn’t Shikha Sharma quit yet?
- No, sir.

1348
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:06,520
Good.

1349
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:43,140
Oh, my God!

1350
01:34:44,630 --> 01:34:45,500
Hey.

1351
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:47,970
It's a love bite, right?

1352
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:52,710
What happened?
I am just asking.

1353
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:55,800
You have a boyfriend, right?

1354
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:57,690
Bilal, I don't want
to talk about this.

1355
01:35:00,630 --> 01:35:02,630
You met him last night,
didn't you?

1356
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:04,880
Dude, I just said, I don't
want to talk about it.

1357
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,150
All right.

1358
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:10,890
We both are friends.
But it doesn't mean

1359
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:13,360
that we share
everything about ourselves.

1360
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:16,780
Why are you getting defensive?

1361
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:18,560
There's no need for that.

1362
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:19,700
In friendship...

1363
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:22,410
...people usually share everything
with each other. Don't they?

1364
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:23,420
I don't.

1365
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:26,270
I need my space.

1366
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:30,860
Bilal.
From now on, if you think

1367
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:33,030
you shouldn't share
everything with me...

1368
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:34,300
...then please don't.

1369
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:37,370
Don't expect me to give you
my biodata, man.

1370
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:41,610
Seems everyone is right.

1371
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:45,920
- You are playing me.
- What?

1372
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:48,740
What do you mean
by I'm playing you?

1373
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:51,470
Because I didn't tell you
that I have a boyfriend?

1374
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:54,340
He is my boyfriend.
That's my personal life.

1375
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,020
How does it matter to you?

1376
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,580
Did I come to you and ask you
to be my friend, my buddy...

1377
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:01,710
...and to take care of me?

1378
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:03,010
No.

1379
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:05,740
If you are feeling bad
then please leave me alone.

1380
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:08,390
Listen.
A word of advice, Shikha.

1381
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,290
No one!

1382
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:14,330
Absolutely no one
wins a battle on their own.

1383
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:15,850
Got it?

1384
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:24,680
One lakh, one thousand, two hundred
and eighty Indian army soldiers...

1385
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:28,640
...are deployed in 16 peacekeeping
missions, worldwide.

1386
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:30,880
In all these overseas operation...

1387
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:33,150
...the special forces
play a special role.

1388
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:37,070
The missions in which even
the toughest soldiers give up...

1389
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:39,040
...we go to those missions
and operate.

1390
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:42,180
That's why we put you all
such rigorous training.

1391
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:43,420
[Whistle]

1392
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:48,220
The one who survive this...

1393
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:49,790
...can go through anything.

1394
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:52,910
Come on, Capt. Rathore.
Get inside.

1395
01:37:03,170 --> 01:37:05,960
Are you scared, Capt. Manit?
Don't be scared.

1396
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:07,560
[Bhatti] 'When the pain
becomes unbearable...'

1397
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:08,920
[Bhatti] '...you stop feeling it.'

1398
01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:11,740
[Bhatti] 'Go ahead
and experience the pain.'

1399
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:13,210
[Bhatti] 'Understand its value.'

1400
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:15,670
[Bhatti] 'Your pain will
become your strength.'

1401
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,090
[Bhatti] 'Your power to endure
will increase so much...'

1402
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:22,170
[Bhatti] '...that you won't let
any kind of fear break you.'

1403
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:24,510
Commando!

1404
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:43,120
"I am used to winning."

1405
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,800
"This is the end of enemies."

1406
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:50,790
"- India is in my heart.
- India is in my heart."

1407
01:37:50,910 --> 01:37:56,190
"The motive of my life
is to protect my country."

1408
01:37:56,290 --> 01:38:01,090
"India is in my heart."

1409
01:38:01,370 --> 01:38:06,380
"I am not weak
nor less than anyone."

1410
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:11,700
"I don't mind sacrificing my life."

1411
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:16,990
"I am proud to say
that the tricolour is my life."

1412
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:20,660
- "India is in my heart."
- Get the first aid. Hurry up.

1413
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:27,290
"India is in my heart."

1414
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:33,170
"India is in my heart."

1415
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:49,960
"India is in my heart."

1416
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:54,760
Commando!

1417
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:13,400
As I always say...

1418
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,920
...the weak have no place here.

1419
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:17,660
The one who gets scared...

1420
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:19,910
...will either go home...

1421
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:22,020
...or lose his life.

1422
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:25,460
We aren’t even halfway through
Dozakh yet, Captains.

1423
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:29,070
Before we move ahead,
a 20 minute break.

1424
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,490
- Let's take a nap.
- Yes, sir.

1425
01:39:41,620 --> 01:39:43,750
Don't take my words so seriously.

1426
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:46,760
When I say break,
I mean your bones will break.

1427
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:50,020
- Shall we move ahead!
- Yes, sir...

1428
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:52,110
An uphill march for one hour...

1429
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:54,670
...is waiting for you.

1430
01:39:55,790 --> 01:39:57,190
You have to bring the flag...

1431
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:58,610
...from the checkpoint delta.

1432
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:01,610
- Didn't you hear me?
- Yes, sir...

1433
01:40:01,850 --> 01:40:02,760
Come on.

1434
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:08,680
What happened, Bilal?

1435
01:40:08,780 --> 01:40:10,200
Nothing.
Just a small cut.

1436
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:13,800
Apply mud on it.
It will get healed.

1437
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:19,000
- Bilal, you okay?
- I'm fine.

1438
01:40:22,770 --> 01:40:24,220
Is everything okay, Shikha?

1439
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:26,970
[Siren]

1440
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:34,830
Sir.

1441
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:38,440
The results are here.

1442
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:45,010
We have divided the probies
into two squads for the next task.

1443
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:48,190
Capt. Rohan will lead Squad Alpha.

1444
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:50,540
And Capt. Tank
will lead Squad Bravo.

1445
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:51,870
Okay.
Thank you.

1446
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:56,770
- Kripal.
- Sir.

1447
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:03,320
No matter how well
one performs individually...

1448
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,340
...in group or in the buddy
exercises...

1449
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:08,650
...the biggest skill
for a commando...

1450
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:10,240
...is leadership.

1451
01:41:14,630 --> 01:41:18,240
- You know what I mean.
- Sir.

1452
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:32,930
[Moving car]

1453
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:35,970
[Siren]

1454
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:43,420
- Are you having fun?
- Yes, sir...

1455
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:44,800
You'll enjoy it more now.

1456
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:48,690
You are being divided
into two squads...

1457
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,490
...for the second and the most
dangerous part of Dozakh.

1458
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:58,100
Rohan, Manit, Bilal, Sharma,
Vishnu, Tej Bahadur.

1459
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:00,480
You all are Squad Alpha.

1460
01:42:02,030 --> 01:42:03,810
Rest everyone is Squad Bravo.

1461
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:05,450
Squad Bravo.

1462
01:42:05,670 --> 01:42:07,410
Your leader will be Capt. Tank.

1463
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:10,540
And the one to lead
Squad Alpha is...

1464
01:42:11,450 --> 01:42:12,840
I'm sure it's Rathore.

1465
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,030
Capt. Sharma.

1466
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:27,670
Capt. Shikha Sharma.

1467
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,650
You are not even able
to stand straight.

1468
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:33,280
How are you going
to lead the squad?

1469
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:34,960
I'll do it, sir.

1470
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,380
Are you ready for the most
difficult challenge of Dozakh?

1471
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:40,690
Yes, sir.

1472
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,200
I can't hear you, Capt. Sharma.

1473
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:43,430
Yes, sir!

1474
01:42:45,890 --> 01:42:46,770
Good.

1475
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:48,910
Keep this in mind.

1476
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,690
Tell her that she
is leaving against our will.

1477
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,590
The doors of this house
are forever shut for her.

1478
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:18,880
We loved her so much.
Where did we lack?

1479
01:43:18,990 --> 01:43:20,100
We got her educated.

1480
01:43:21,710 --> 01:43:23,020
And she isn't even
ready to listen to us.

1481
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:29,810
I lost my son because of
this obsession with the army.

1482
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:32,380
And now she is...

1483
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:02,900
Don't feel bad
for what your dad said.

1484
01:44:03,450 --> 01:44:05,740
He is angry right now.
He'll be fine after a while.

1485
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:11,040
You can go.
You must go.

1486
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,160
I know one thing about you, Shikha.

1487
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,740
You can achieve whatever you want.

1488
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:22,910
And if someone stops you
from doing something...

1489
01:44:23,650 --> 01:44:25,760
...you will definitely do it.

1490
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:50,050
[Mother] 'Just be careful.'

1491
01:44:50,190 --> 01:44:53,480
Actually, girls are changing
but not guys.

1492
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:57,960
Guys don't like girls
who leave them behind.

1493
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,260
Always keep this in mind.

1494
01:46:06,940 --> 01:46:08,080
March.

1495
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:16,130
Come on... Fall in!
Hurry up.

1496
01:46:16,650 --> 01:46:17,770
Captains.

1497
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,590
Till now, Mr. Naved and I...

1498
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:24,380
...were here to hold your hand
just like a shadow.

1499
01:46:26,010 --> 01:46:27,250
Consider this a real mission...

1500
01:46:27,940 --> 01:46:29,130
...and not a task.

1501
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:33,210
In these exercises,
live ammunition will be used.

1502
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:35,630
Remember...

1503
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:38,450
...ignorance can lead to disaster.

1504
01:46:40,410 --> 01:46:42,070
In the first stage,
you have to reach here.

1505
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,120
Enemy's territory.

1506
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:46,640
Point A for Squad Alpha.

1507
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:49,060
Point X for Squad Bravo.

1508
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:51,980
After reaching there,
if you succeed...

1509
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:54,350
...you might find ration
to survive in the mission.

1510
01:46:55,270 --> 01:46:57,820
We'll be following you anyway.

1511
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:02,510
You have only 10 minutes
to study the map.

1512
01:47:02,770 --> 01:47:03,820
Quick.

1513
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:12,570
Okay, Vishnu. You and I will
be in charge of navigation.

1514
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:14,040
Manit, you will be my 2IC.

1515
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:17,030
Bilal, medical.
Tej, communication.

1516
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:18,760
Capt. Rohan, weapons.

1517
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:22,710
Any doubt, Capt. Rohan?

1518
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:30,270
No, sir.

1519
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,440
Did you all study the map?

1520
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,270
- Yes, sir...
- Good.

1521
01:47:37,550 --> 01:47:38,550
Then give it back.

1522
01:47:44,890 --> 01:47:46,350
If you can’t do without a map..

1523
01:47:47,550 --> 01:47:48,840
...you are not worthy
to be in the special forces.

1524
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:50,910
Yes, sir...

1525
01:47:52,490 --> 01:47:55,880
All the best, buddy. You have
to do the back seat driving.

1526
01:47:56,850 --> 01:47:59,480
You know how good women
are with directions, right?

1527
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:08,420
Capt. Sharma.

1528
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:11,490
Good luck.

1529
01:48:13,930 --> 01:48:15,110
Thank you.

1530
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:53,870
Which way, Vishnu?

1531
01:48:53,950 --> 01:48:55,980
Left or right?

1532
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:00,660
Let's go right.

1533
01:49:02,130 --> 01:49:03,220
You are wrong, Shikha.

1534
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,680
We just crossed that hillock.

1535
01:49:05,970 --> 01:49:06,970
This is the right way.

1536
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:08,290
Try to recall the map.

1537
01:49:08,490 --> 01:49:09,500
That hillock was in the north.

1538
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:11,180
We need to go that way
and not this way.

1539
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:12,330
I know what I am doing.

1540
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:14,250
And I heard both of you talking.

1541
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:16,350
Just because I'm a girl,
my navigation is wrong.

1542
01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:18,330
- When did I say that?
- You didn't but you thought so.

1543
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:21,180
- Seriously, Shiks.
- Capt. Soren. It's Capt. Sharma.

1544
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:26,990
Really?
So the authority card, huh?

1545
01:49:28,190 --> 01:49:30,840
Okay.
Cool.

1546
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:32,830
Roger, ma'am.

1547
01:49:35,090 --> 01:49:36,700
We are going this way
and that's final.

1548
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:00,930
Sir.

1549
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:03,650
I marked this tree an hour ago.

1550
01:50:05,530 --> 01:50:07,680
We have come back
to the same point.

1551
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:12,490
Great.

1552
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:13,800
You know what?

1553
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:16,160
Surje would've been really happy
if he were in our team.

1554
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:18,820
We are prancing around a tree
like in a Hindi movie's song.

1555
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:21,260
S**t!

1556
01:50:22,230 --> 01:50:23,460
Which way, Capt. Sharma?

1557
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:29,950
I'm really sorry.

1558
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,330
Let's go back to that hillock.

1559
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:37,270
- We'll start navigating again...
- Negative.

1560
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:41,180
Neither do we have time
nor do we need to go back.

1561
01:50:41,820 --> 01:50:43,080
Time and effort,
both will go waste.

1562
01:50:44,530 --> 01:50:45,910
Anyway, it's going to be dawn soon.

1563
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:49,200
It'll be easier to navigate.
We should wait.

1564
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:51,260
Makes sense.

1565
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,390
I still think we should go back.

1566
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:05,540
Okay, fine.

1567
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:07,860
Halt till daybreak.

1568
01:51:08,510 --> 01:51:09,830
Capt. Rohan, weapons check.

1569
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:14,080
- Vishnu.
- All in.

1570
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:19,200
- Capt. Sharma.
- All in.

1571
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,300
- Bilal.
- All in.

1572
01:51:27,610 --> 01:51:28,740
Sir.

1573
01:51:33,230 --> 01:51:34,460
One of my magazines is missing.

1574
01:51:34,540 --> 01:51:35,630
Manit.

1575
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:38,300
- Manit.
- All in.

1576
01:51:38,590 --> 01:51:39,640
Tej.

1577
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:44,950
All in, sir.

1578
01:51:47,530 --> 01:51:48,540
All in.

1579
01:51:49,350 --> 01:51:51,200
You can't make
everything official, Tej.

1580
01:51:52,110 --> 01:51:54,590
- It was there till we crossed
the last point, right? - Yes.

1581
01:51:54,730 --> 01:51:57,230
So, it has gone missing
somewhere in-between.

1582
01:51:58,610 --> 01:52:01,040
We are taking a halt.
Just go and search for it.

1583
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:21,980
[Footsteps]

1584
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,060
Vishnu and Manit, head west.

1585
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:48,140
Rohan and Tej.

1586
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:49,560
You will approach
the house from the east.

1587
01:52:49,630 --> 01:52:51,490
- Bilal will give cover. Copy?
- Copy.

1588
01:52:51,550 --> 01:52:52,710
Go.

1589
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:56,300
[Footsteps]

1590
01:53:09,810 --> 01:53:10,970
[Whistle]

1591
01:53:16,730 --> 01:53:17,910
Alpha2 to Alpha1.

1592
01:53:18,030 --> 01:53:19,840
In position.
Twenty yards away.

1593
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,420
The wall is broken.
Roof is missing.

1594
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:23,660
There is complete silence.
No sign of activity. Over.

1595
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:24,840
Alpha3, over.

1596
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:25,920
Alpha3 in position.

1597
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,240
There is a wall in front of me.
I can't see the house. Over.

1598
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:30,680
Copy Alpha3, hold position.
Bilal, hold position.

1599
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:38,190
Alpha2, you will go ahead.
We'll give you cover. Over.

1600
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:42,620
Okay.
Moving in 3, 2, 1. Out.

1601
01:54:01,290 --> 01:54:06,100
[Footsteps]

1602
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:25,670
Alpha1, all clear.
Over.

1603
01:54:26,910 --> 01:54:29,960
Copy. Squad Alpha.
Moving inside. Over.

1604
01:54:31,290 --> 01:54:32,770
Where is the food?

1605
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:35,800
I swear, Vishnu.

1606
01:54:35,890 --> 01:54:38,940
Today I don't mind having bland,
boiled chicken served in the mess.

1607
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:40,910
Yes, dude.

1608
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:43,010
It's been 34 hours
since we had food.

1609
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:44,700
Where is the food?

1610
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:48,370
There it is.

1611
01:54:52,070 --> 01:54:55,530
Oh, s**t!
Don't move. It'll blast.

1612
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:57,770
Take cover.

1613
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:05,000
[Beeping sound]

1614
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:10,430
Careful.

1615
01:55:10,850 --> 01:55:15,740
[Beeping sound]

1616
01:55:29,510 --> 01:55:30,820
What the f**k!

1617
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:32,670
What the f**k!

1618
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:38,250
[Beeping sound]

1619
01:55:38,430 --> 01:55:41,430
Alpha1, there is a bomb
here, not food.

1620
01:55:42,290 --> 01:55:44,010
It got activated as soon
as Vishnu stepped on it.

1621
01:55:44,630 --> 01:55:48,100
It's an IED.
I repeat, it's an IED.

1622
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:50,020
It's a 155 mm shell.

1623
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:52,530
It contains 6 kgs TNT...

1624
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:53,980
...with blasting power
of 300 pounds.

1625
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:55,330
[Vishnu] 'If I move even slightly,
everything around me...'

1626
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:57,000
...in a 100 metre radius will
be destroyed.

1627
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,910
Good to know because we are
just 30 metres away from you.

1628
01:56:01,450 --> 01:56:02,730
Manit, is there a timer?

1629
01:56:02,810 --> 01:56:04,800
I just said, it's a f*****g IED.

1630
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:06,520
We just have 2 minutes 45 seconds.

1631
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:07,940
Please order.

1632
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,780
- Capt. Vishnu, hold position.
- Copy.

1633
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:13,880
Capt. Manit, you have worked
with IED explosives before.

1634
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:15,180
[Shikha] 'Correct?
Can you work this?'

1635
01:56:15,410 --> 01:56:17,360
I can do it.
But...

1636
01:56:18,590 --> 01:56:20,380
I would have to check
the blasting cap.

1637
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:22,510
I'll get to know
once I find the source.

1638
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:26,430
- Spring or pressure mechanism?
- Spring. But lots of wires.

1639
01:56:26,490 --> 01:56:29,860
Bhatti's favourite brand must
be United Colors of Benetton.

1640
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:32,010
[Manit] 'B******d,
it's a rainbow of wires.'

1641
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:38,400
Manit, hurry up.

1642
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:41,650
F**k.
I am doing it, dude.

1643
01:56:41,730 --> 01:56:43,880
It's too hot. Can't f**k
around with it too much.

1644
01:56:44,590 --> 01:56:46,590
Manit, eliminate the
wires one by one...

1645
01:56:46,650 --> 01:56:47,810
...based on what they
are connected to.

1646
01:56:48,610 --> 01:56:51,570
This is not the video in, video
out lead of TV, Capt. Sharma.

1647
01:56:51,650 --> 01:56:53,920
You know you take stating
the obvious to another level.

1648
01:56:54,030 --> 01:56:56,490
Manit, please focus on your job.

1649
01:57:01,030 --> 01:57:02,350
Okay, it's not the green wire.

1650
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:08,040
Black is out too.

1651
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:12,880
75 seconds more, Manit.

1652
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,720
I can see the damn numbers, dude!

1653
01:57:21,170 --> 01:57:22,070
Okay.

1654
01:57:22,170 --> 01:57:23,880
There are two wires.
Red and blue.

1655
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:26,030
One of them is connected
to the blasting cap.

1656
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:28,620
- If I cut the wrong one,
it'll blast. - F**k.

1657
01:57:30,010 --> 01:57:32,260
Okay, Manit.
Look carefully.

1658
01:57:32,570 --> 01:57:33,850
Where are the wires connected from?

1659
01:57:36,020 --> 01:57:37,540
Both are going into
the same box, dude.

1660
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:41,580
- F**k.
- What?

1661
01:57:41,660 --> 01:57:42,850
- We are f****d.
- What...

1662
01:57:42,930 --> 01:57:44,260
Both wires have been stripped down.

1663
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:45,380
Both have been tied...

1664
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:47,040
...and connected
to an electric device...

1665
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:48,320
...which is connected to the timer.

1666
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:52,330
I think it's the red wire.
I'm going with the red.

1667
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:55,190
- Wait.
- What, dude? We are losing time.

1668
01:57:55,270 --> 01:57:56,570
It's a trap.
Go with the blue.

1669
01:57:57,090 --> 01:57:58,280
Are you f*****g kidding me?

1670
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:00,170
Bomb is in front of me.
The device is in my hand.

1671
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:02,030
I feel I should cut the red wire.
I'm going with the red.

1672
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:04,730
Manit, I have an instinct.
It's reverse psychology.

1673
01:58:04,810 --> 01:58:05,810
Go with the blue.

1674
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:08,200
Instinct?
What about logic?

1675
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:11,990
We lost many hours because
of your instinct, Capt. Sharma.

1676
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:13,970
It's not the time for guess work.
I'm going with the red.

1677
01:58:14,350 --> 01:58:15,990
- Manit, blue. - Red.
- Blue.

1678
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:17,840
- Red.
- Blue. It's an order.

1679
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:20,250
- Manit, go with the red.
- Rohan, you stay out of this.

1680
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:22,090
- Blue...
- Red...

1681
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:23,100
Red!

1682
01:58:23,190 --> 01:58:25,440
[Beeping sound]

1683
01:58:29,530 --> 01:58:30,550
It stopped.

1684
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:33,450
Vishnu, it stopped.
It stopped.

1685
01:58:33,850 --> 01:58:35,650
Vishnu, we are safe.

1686
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:40,740
Hurray!
[Cheers]

1687
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:42,970
[Manit] 'Die another day, b*tch!'

1688
01:58:46,330 --> 01:58:48,320
Well done, bro.

1689
01:58:50,130 --> 01:58:51,150
Close one.

1690
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:53,440
- Seriously. Logic.
- Not instinct, but logic.

1691
01:58:54,860 --> 01:58:55,880
Well done, Manit.

1692
01:58:56,180 --> 01:58:58,700
But what you did
amounts to breach of orders.

1693
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:03,050
Are you being serious?

1694
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:07,080
Yeah. Manit didn't follow
the orders of his team leader.

1695
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:09,210
Thank God he didn't
follow your orders.

1696
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:11,290
Look what happened when
Vishnu followed your orders.

1697
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:13,870
There is a reason there is a chain
of command in the army, okay?

1698
01:59:14,210 --> 01:59:16,200
And you out of all people
should know that.

1699
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:17,170
Excuse me.

1700
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:20,030
You need to be alive in order to
follow the orders, Capt. Sharma.

1701
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,120
Are you upset with Manit
or with yourself...

1702
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:23,750
...for two terrible judgements
in a row now?

1703
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:26,620
- Stop getting personal, Bilal.
- I'm not getting personal.

1704
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,590
Bilal, Shikha.
Time out, guys.

1705
01:59:33,680 --> 01:59:34,870
Shikha, come on.
We are a team.

1706
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:36,960
We maybe a team.

1707
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:39,230
But the last I checked
the army was not a democracy.

1708
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:41,560
Unbelievable.

1709
01:59:41,930 --> 01:59:43,790
Just because you were
made the leader of this task

1710
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:45,470
do you think you are God?

1711
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:49,890
The entire jungle would
have burned to ashes...

1712
01:59:49,970 --> 01:59:51,350
...due to the amount of TNT
present in that bomb.

1713
01:59:51,490 --> 01:59:54,110
Okay. Guys, obviously
I'm glad, we are alive.

1714
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:56,160
No, it's not that obvious.

1715
01:59:57,390 --> 01:59:58,740
Rules are rules.

1716
01:59:59,550 --> 02:00:00,670
That's the first thing
we are taught...

1717
02:00:00,750 --> 02:00:02,630
- ...when we come into the academy.
- What the f**k, dude!

1718
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:06,010
S***a, I saved everyone's life.
This is the thanks I am getting.

1719
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:07,330
Lower your voice!

1720
02:00:07,790 --> 02:00:08,850
I'm still your team leader.

1721
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:10,730
Yeah. But maybe not on merit.

1722
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:12,270
Excuse me.

1723
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:15,990
I guess we all agree that our team
leader is wrong and we are right.

1724
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:18,990
- And we know to set things right.
- Oh, really?

1725
02:00:20,030 --> 02:00:21,880
How, Capt. Rathore?

1726
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:25,070
Do you really want
to know, Capt. Sharma?

1727
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:32,610
[Moving car]

1728
02:00:36,140 --> 02:00:37,160
[Door close]

1729
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:41,670
- Jai Hind, sir...
- Jai Hind.

1730
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:44,210
At ease.

1731
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:47,790
Any problem, Capt. Sharma?

1732
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:52,250
- No, sir. - Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1733
02:00:54,030 --> 02:00:55,480
In that case,
well done, Squad Alpha.

1734
02:00:55,820 --> 02:00:57,780
You defused the bomb successfully.

1735
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:02,030
Had it got detonated,
you wouldn't have lost your life

1736
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:04,520
but could have been badly injured.

1737
02:01:05,430 --> 02:01:09,520
Anyway, Squad Bravo
completed the task an hour ago.

Let's move ahead.

1739
02:01:12,550 --> 02:01:14,480
The last and the most
dangerous task.

1740

Ten kms ahead,
in the enemy's village...

...point B.

1742
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:22,270
You'll have to retrieve a very
important packet from there.

1743
02:01:24,330 --> 02:01:26,050
And because you didn't
get anything to eat...

1744
02:01:27,140 --> 02:01:28,420
...you can eat these pills.

1745
02:01:30,150 --> 02:01:31,840
It will re-energise you.

1746

1747
02:01:48,220 --> 02:01:51,150
These are not vitamin pills.
These are sleeping pills.

1748
02:01:52,470 --> 02:01:54,570
These pills will prepare
you for the day...

1749
02:01:54,770 --> 02:01:56,620
...when you would complete
your operation without sleeping...

1750
02:01:56,680 --> 02:01:58,630
...not for hours but for days.

1751
02:01:59,610 --> 02:02:00,850
Despite being deprived of sleep...

1752
02:02:01,010 --> 02:02:03,450
...you'll have to be alert
and take the right decision.

1753
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:05,060
The one who sleeps today...

1754
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:08,890

during a real operation.

Capt. Bilal got injured
and Capt. Shikha fell unconscious.

That's why I had
to take over the command.

as such over there

1809

that Capt. Sharma
ended up in this state?

No, dude.
Don't apologise to me.

There is someone else
whom we should apologise to.

02:07:20,930 --> 02:07:25,300
If you say, shall I talk to dad
about your posting in Lucknow?

- No.

with us for our whole lives.

write the debriefing reports.

02:16:12,760 --> 02:16:13,940
[Phone ringing]

1906
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:15,770
Damn it.

1907
02:16:19,670 --> 02:16:21,120
I said no phone calls.

1908
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:24,090
Okay.
Put him on.

1909
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:29,600
Yes, Mr. Mathur.
She is doing fine.

1910
02:16:31,370 --> 02:16:32,540
It's in three weeks.

1911
02:16:34,460 --> 02:16:37,200
All right.
It shall be arranged.

1912
02:16:39,380 --> 02:16:40,610
The defence minister
herself wants to attend

1913
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:43,210
the passing out parade of the SFTC.

1914
02:16:45,130 --> 02:16:46,650
POP is in three weeks’ time.

1915
02:16:46,910 --> 02:16:48,150
Bloody hell.

1916
02:16:49,100 --> 02:16:51,170
Looks like, we are sitting
on a ticking time bomb.

1917
02:17:02,140 --> 02:17:03,570
- Good morning, sir.
- Relax.

1918
02:17:04,090 --> 02:17:05,230
How are you feeling now?

1919
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:08,320
Very well, sir. Thank you.
Thank you for asking, sir.

1920
02:17:11,430 --> 02:17:13,090
I still didn't receive
the RMO's report.

1921
02:17:13,180 --> 02:17:14,950
But looking at you...

1922
02:17:15,030 --> 02:17:18,380
...it seems you will
take time to recover.

1923
02:17:21,390 --> 02:17:22,870
Capt. Sharma, you know...

1924
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:26,480
...that Capt. Siddiqui had
to leave after Dozakh.

1925
02:17:26,760 --> 02:17:28,790
You also know
Capt. Surje's condition.

1926
02:17:30,890 --> 02:17:33,550
I am trying to say that so
far you've done everything...

1927
02:17:34,070 --> 02:17:36,580
...with passion, preparation
and commitment.

1928
02:17:38,050 --> 02:17:39,870
But after recovering...

1929
02:17:40,090 --> 02:17:41,990
...it won't be easy to
catch up with everyone.

1930
02:17:42,890 --> 02:17:46,670
Actually, it will
be really difficult.

1931
02:17:48,590 --> 02:17:52,760
And I don't want the future
of a good officer to be damaged.

1932
02:17:54,530 --> 02:17:56,150
If you want to leave now...

1933
02:17:57,350 --> 02:18:00,560
...I will not consider
you as a failure.

1934
02:18:03,370 --> 02:18:04,370
I mean it.

1935
02:18:08,840 --> 02:18:12,120
In fact, if you would like
to volunteer next year...

1936
02:18:12,210 --> 02:18:14,150
...I myself will recommend you.

1937
02:18:19,220 --> 02:18:20,380
But...

1938
02:18:20,660 --> 02:18:24,870
...the final decision
is going to be yours.

1939
02:18:26,410 --> 02:18:28,230
[Bedi] 'Has any official
complaint been lodged yet?'

1940
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:29,520
Not yet.

1941
02:18:30,660 --> 02:18:33,000
But maybe the complaint
has been suppressed.

1942
02:18:33,090 --> 02:18:35,360
Stop spinning
conspiracy theories, Raman.

1943
02:18:35,550 --> 02:18:37,050
Sathe can't do that.

1944
02:18:38,480 --> 02:18:39,600
Bedi.

1945
02:18:39,690 --> 02:18:41,940
Sathe's port from
colonel to brigadier...

1946
02:18:42,030 --> 02:18:43,150
...is due this year.

1947
02:18:43,740 --> 02:18:47,160
One such incident
can finish his career.

1948
02:19:20,510 --> 02:19:22,280
[Phone ringing]

1949
02:19:22,610 --> 02:19:23,680
Good morning, sir.

1950
02:19:24,230 --> 02:19:26,320
Sathe, I called about Dozakh.

1951
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:27,810
How did it go?

1952
02:19:28,170 --> 02:19:29,870
The usual, sir.
A few injuries...

1953
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:31,720
[Sathe] '...a few unexpected
incidents.'

1954
02:19:32,390 --> 02:19:33,520
And Shikha?

1955
02:19:34,750 --> 02:19:37,270
Well, the Dozakh
reports are confidential.

1956
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:39,500
But if you are asking me
officially then probably I can...

1957
02:19:39,590 --> 02:19:41,150
No...
It's all right.

1958
02:19:42,070 --> 02:19:44,700
Sathe, you know
the stakes are really high.

1959
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:48,360
So, just keep me updated.

1960
02:19:49,480 --> 02:19:50,430
Yes, sir.

1961
02:19:55,510 --> 02:19:57,290
Either Sathe is
concealing the truth...

1962
02:19:57,370 --> 02:19:59,180
...or he genuinely
doesn't know anything.

1963
02:19:59,660 --> 02:20:01,030
We don't have time
to do guesswork...

1964
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:02,530
...sitting in Delhi.

1965
02:20:02,810 --> 02:20:04,200
You mean another official enquiry.

1966
02:20:04,290 --> 02:20:05,560
Exactly.

1967
02:20:06,150 --> 02:20:08,130
But we have only 3 weeks.

1968
02:20:09,480 --> 02:20:11,650
We need someone
who can go there...

1969
02:20:11,740 --> 02:20:15,730
...and check all the facts in
an unbiased and objective way.

1970
02:20:16,590 --> 02:20:20,010
Someone whom we can trust.

1971
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:23,200
Since you have already
given all this a thought...

1972
02:20:23,290 --> 02:20:26,630
...tell me, who is going
to lead this investigation?

1973
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:30,550
Well, someone whom
I implicitly trust.

1974
02:20:31,250 --> 02:20:33,090
There is only one officer
in my mind.

1975
02:20:33,380 --> 02:20:35,910
Someone who can call
a spade, a spade.

1976
02:20:36,390 --> 02:20:38,700
- Imtiyaz Hussain.
- Literally?

1977
02:20:39,660 --> 02:20:40,990
Your poker champ?

1978
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:45,430
In such a short time,
no one else can do this work.

1979
02:20:46,590 --> 02:20:48,840
I agree that his
ways are different.

1980
02:20:49,270 --> 02:20:50,390
But you know what?

1981
02:20:50,520 --> 02:20:53,070
Nine times out of ten, they work.

1982
02:20:54,090 --> 02:20:56,320
Okay. Let's hope
for all our sake...

1983
02:20:56,800 --> 02:20:59,710
...that this isn't that
proverbial tenth time.

1984
02:21:08,710 --> 02:21:11,430
You blink, you lose.

1985
02:21:12,430 --> 02:21:13,480
I know that.

1986
02:21:15,290 --> 02:21:19,600
[Ticking sound]

1987
02:21:24,600 --> 02:21:25,940
Yes!

1988
02:21:26,440 --> 02:21:27,780
Dear, always remember.

1989
02:21:27,870 --> 02:21:29,710
In life as well as in poker...

1990
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:32,630
...if you want to win, focus
is always on their eyes.

1991
02:21:33,570 --> 02:21:36,230
Dad, you win against everyone...

1992
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:38,380
then how do you lose
against me and mom?

1993
02:21:39,300 --> 02:21:40,530
Dear, you are a champ.

1994
02:21:40,620 --> 02:21:43,440
And your mom is a
bigger champ than you.

1995
02:21:43,530 --> 02:21:45,920
No one could defeat
your mom till date.

1996
02:21:47,050 --> 02:21:49,100
-[Mallika] Immi.
- Yeah. Coming.

1997
02:21:49,190 --> 02:21:52,660
You know I always win
and dad always loses.

1998
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:55,120
Taste this and tell me...

1999
02:21:58,760 --> 02:21:59,900
How is it?

2000
02:22:01,360 --> 02:22:02,740
Mutton is not cooked properly.

2001
02:22:02,830 --> 02:22:03,730
Come on, Immi.

2002
02:22:03,820 --> 02:22:06,240
Even the Hyderabadi Nawabs'
don't throw such tantrums.

2003
02:22:06,330 --> 02:22:08,200
Come on.
I belong to their family.

2004
02:22:08,620 --> 02:22:10,760
Really?
Shut up, liar.

2005
02:22:11,010 --> 02:22:12,870
- I crossed check
with your aunt also. - Is it?

2006
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:16,760
She told me that you are not even
remotely connected to the Nawabs.

2007
02:22:16,850 --> 02:22:18,790
- Okay. I'll get a proof.
- Okay.

2008
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:20,670
- Eid Mubarak.
- Dad!

2009
02:22:23,070 --> 02:22:24,810
- Grandpa!
- Oh...

2010
02:22:25,070 --> 02:22:27,020
- Eid Mubarak!
- Eid Mubarak, dear!

2011
02:22:27,710 --> 02:22:29,060
- Eid Mubarak!
- Eid Mubarak!

2012
02:22:29,690 --> 02:22:30,930
Dad, you are so late.

2013
02:22:32,620 --> 02:22:34,090
I had some work at the office.

2014
02:22:34,180 --> 02:22:34,970
What do you mean by late?

2015
02:22:35,300 --> 02:22:37,430
Biryani is being
cooked since 4 to 5 hours.

2016
02:22:38,480 --> 02:22:40,620
Sir, you have come
just at the right time. Please.

2017
02:22:42,280 --> 02:22:46,050
Okay, Mallika. I need to borrow
your ex-husband for a little while.

2018
02:22:46,140 --> 02:22:47,500
- May I?
- Sure.

2019
02:22:57,180 --> 02:22:59,340
"Sexual assault on
Capt. Shikha Sharma!"

2020
02:22:59,420 --> 02:23:00,250
The First Test Case!

2021
02:23:01,580 --> 02:23:02,820
You can't be serious, sir.

2022
02:23:02,910 --> 02:23:04,850
I genuinely hope
that this isn't true.

2023
02:23:06,650 --> 02:23:09,730
If it is then we need to
bring the culprit to book.

2024
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:12,500
He should be punished
so severely...

2025
02:23:12,590 --> 02:23:16,110
...that no one should even think
of doing something like this.

2026
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:21,790
Language is quite clinical.

2027
02:23:22,530 --> 02:23:25,360
He has written adm for
administration and not admin.

2028
02:23:25,880 --> 02:23:28,450
cdr for commander
and coa for company.

2029
02:23:28,970 --> 02:23:30,350
Army abbreviations.

2030
02:23:31,490 --> 02:23:33,890
And look at this, sir.
Time stamp.

2031
02:23:34,420 --> 02:23:36,600
Only soldiers use
such kind of time stamp.

2032
02:23:37,350 --> 02:23:39,830
It means that certainly
this mail has been sent...

2033
02:23:41,090 --> 02:23:42,720
...by someone from the SFTC.

2034
02:23:45,370 --> 02:23:46,470
Anything else?

2035
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:48,890
I read Capt. Shikha's file...

2036
02:23:48,980 --> 02:23:51,170
...when she was chosen
for the Test Case.

2037
02:23:52,030 --> 02:23:54,710
She is a shooting champion
but quite emotional as well.

2038
02:23:55,690 --> 02:23:57,630
And being emotional
in the special forces...

2039
02:23:58,090 --> 02:23:59,360
...is like inviting danger.

2040
02:24:02,630 --> 02:24:04,370
You have three weeks.

2041
02:24:05,090 --> 02:24:06,530
You need to resolve this case...

2042
02:24:06,690 --> 02:24:08,040
...before the course ends.

2043
02:24:09,370 --> 02:24:11,010
Roger, sir.
Wilco.

2044
02:24:11,270 --> 02:24:13,960
Will comply.
And you.

2045
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:18,010
Got my poker face on, sir.

2046
02:25:11,730 --> 02:25:13,480
Will you finish the packing
today itself, Mom?

2047
02:25:14,100 --> 02:25:15,510
My train is scheduled
to leave tomorrow evening

2048
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:17,340
You are going to join
the special forces.

2049
02:25:17,530 --> 02:25:18,900
Everything should be perfect.

2050
02:25:19,790 --> 02:25:22,550
You seem to know the
special forces very well.

2051
02:25:23,180 --> 02:25:24,080
Why?

2052
02:25:24,630 --> 02:25:27,560
Didn't I spend so many
years with your dad?

2053
02:25:28,530 --> 02:25:30,720
Even the toughest
people give up there.

2054
02:25:31,260 --> 02:25:32,750
It's a very difficult course, dear.

2055
02:25:33,080 --> 02:25:34,330
I see.

2056
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:37,820
It seems as if Sakshi Malik
is going for a wrestling match.

2057
02:25:38,270 --> 02:25:42,030
You're more excited than me to
see me in the SF's uniform. Right?

2058
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:46,760
The uniform and the status
are two different things.

2059
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:49,040
You got the uniform.

2060
02:25:49,300 --> 02:25:50,640
Now, you need to earn the status.

2061
02:25:52,020 --> 02:25:53,450
Keep one thing in mind, dear.

2062
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:55,390
This is an opportunity...

2063
02:25:55,850 --> 02:25:59,870
...which your grandma
and your mom didn't get.

2064
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:02,380
Only you got it.

2065
02:26:04,140 --> 02:26:05,550
No matter what...

2066
02:26:06,660 --> 02:26:08,300
...never give up, dear.

2067
02:26:12,200 --> 02:26:13,840
You are the most special girl...

2068
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:17,010
...that is why you are going
to join the special force.

2069
02:26:19,830 --> 02:26:22,180
So cute, my Mom.

2070
02:26:22,270 --> 02:26:25,590
What do you keep blabbering
all day long in English?

2071
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:27,500
I don't understand a single word.

2072
02:26:28,310 --> 02:26:30,700
Listen to me carefully, Mom.

2073
02:26:31,860 --> 02:26:35,420
Neither I nor you
or grandma will lose.

2074
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:37,580
Do you know why?

2075
02:26:38,260 --> 02:26:40,740
Because my mom
didn't teach me to lose.

2076
02:26:43,090 --> 02:26:44,530
If you ever lose...

2077
02:26:45,540 --> 02:26:47,530
...I'll break your legs.

2078
02:26:50,550 --> 02:26:51,600
Sure.

2079
02:27:32,730 --> 02:27:33,710
Ma'am.

2080
02:27:35,300 --> 02:27:37,160
Shikha.
Shikha.

2081
02:27:38,280 --> 02:27:39,670
Shikha, what are you doing?

2082
02:27:40,840 --> 02:27:42,430
Shikha, you need some more time.

2083
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:45,800
I don't have the time.
I need to complete the course.

2084
02:27:46,260 --> 02:27:47,560
And what about your injuries?

2085
02:27:48,130 --> 02:27:51,180
What'd you do when Colonel Sathe
will read your reports?

2086
02:27:52,890 --> 02:27:54,720
The injuries are mine
so the story will also be mine.

2087
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:57,620
Everyone will have
to believe what I say.

2088
02:27:59,130 --> 02:28:01,310
- Are you sure about this?
- Affirmative.

2089
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:05,440
Anyway the entire Squad Alpha
said that nothing happened.

2090
02:28:07,460 --> 02:28:08,730
So, nothing happened.

2091
02:28:12,040 --> 02:28:16,120
"I shall help you soar high."

2092
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:21,690
"I shall fight this battle.
Just resolve to win."

2093
02:28:21,970 --> 02:28:24,370
"Just resolve to win."

2094
02:28:31,380 --> 02:28:32,750
[Surje] 'Who is this hero?'

2095
02:28:32,830 --> 02:28:34,090
He came into the picture...

2096
02:28:34,170 --> 02:28:35,510
...like Sunny Deol in Damini.

2097
02:28:36,340 --> 02:28:37,900
[Rohan] 'Colonel Imtiyaz Hussain.'

2098
02:28:38,010 --> 02:28:41,210
General Raman's son-in-law.
Sorry. Ex-son-in-law.

2099
02:28:41,810 --> 02:28:43,650
Few people are very evolved.

2100
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:46,380
Husband and wife are good
friends even after divorce.

2101
02:28:46,730 --> 02:28:48,570
They celebrate all
the festivals together.

2102
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:50,870
Then they go back
to their respective homes.

2103
02:28:53,340 --> 02:28:55,200
I wish every marriage
was like this.

2104
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:59,190
Wives would've visited on festivals
and then gone back to their houses.

2105
02:28:59,810 --> 02:29:00,950
The point is, B*******d...

2106
02:29:01,030 --> 02:29:02,500
...which festival has he
come to celebrate here?

2107
02:29:02,580 --> 02:29:05,860
A few festivals are celebrated
while a few are observed, Surje.

2108
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:07,880
[Avinash] 'I think he fits
into the second category.'

2109
02:29:07,950 --> 02:29:10,420
- Maybe he is our new instructor.
- I don't think so.

2110
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:11,780
[Shikha] 'Good morning, gentlemen.'

2111
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:13,820
What did I miss?

2112
02:29:13,910 --> 02:29:15,390
[Surje] 'You here!'

2113
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:17,100
Aren't you happy to see me here?

2114
02:29:17,160 --> 02:29:19,890
What are you saying, ma'am?
We are obviously happy to see you.

2115
02:29:20,470 --> 02:29:22,030
Good to see you
back on your feet.

2116
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:25,040
Thanks, Surje. I missed
your jokes, dude, actually.

2117
02:29:25,560 --> 02:29:28,080
What will we do during the war
if we get scared in Dozakh?

2118
02:29:28,210 --> 02:29:29,350
[Surje] You are right.

2119
02:29:31,580 --> 02:29:34,270
- Good to see you, Capt. Sharma.
- Tank.

2120
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:37,110
I am sorry that Bilal had to leave.

2121
02:29:39,510 --> 02:29:42,190
Even I regret that I couldn't
meet him before he left.

2122
02:29:58,840 --> 02:30:01,570
Good morning, officers.
Lieutenant Colonel Imtiyaz Hussain.

2123
02:30:01,650 --> 02:30:02,450
Good morning, sir...

2124
02:30:02,530 --> 02:30:05,460
Let's cut to the chase.
I'm not your new instructor.

2125
02:30:05,540 --> 02:30:07,660
In fact I'm here
for a special purpose.

2126
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:11,580
Squad Bravo, you may leave.

2127
02:30:34,480 --> 02:30:35,640
In poker they say...

2128
02:30:35,720 --> 02:30:37,960
...if you can't read
your opponent's cards...

2129
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:40,230
...you better play
only with a good hand.

2130
02:30:41,210 --> 02:30:43,260
What happened in Camp
Dozakh, Squad Alpha...

2131
02:30:43,380 --> 02:30:46,580
...that Capt. Siddiqui
had to go home...

2132
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:49,830
...and Capt. Sharma,
to the hospital?

2133
02:30:52,990 --> 02:30:54,290
Somebody?

2134
02:30:55,100 --> 02:30:56,380
[Imtiyaz] 'Anybody?'

2135
02:30:58,020 --> 02:30:59,380
Nobody.

2136
02:31:01,630 --> 02:31:03,810
I've read your debrief reports.

2137
02:31:04,210 --> 02:31:06,280
And according to
all your reports...

2138
02:31:06,360 --> 02:31:07,950
...nothing happened over there.

2139
02:31:10,070 --> 02:31:14,630
But we got an anonymous mail.
According to which...

2140
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:17,250
...not something but many
things happened there.

2141
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:24,340
So, whom do we believe?
An anonymous mail...

2142
02:31:24,410 --> 02:31:27,410
...or the officers
of the Indian army?

2143
02:31:29,250 --> 02:31:31,040
I think officers
of the Indian army.

2144
02:31:31,290 --> 02:31:34,080
So, I want to give you all
one more chance...

2145
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:41,120
...to recount what
exactly happened.

2146
02:31:46,960 --> 02:31:49,470
This happens many times...

2147
02:31:49,550 --> 02:31:51,560
...a few details becomes
sketchy during actions.

2148
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:56,850
So this time, write after recalling
the things properly. Please.

2149
02:32:01,340 --> 02:32:04,880
Last time you couldn't write
your debrief report, Capt. Sharma.

2150
02:32:05,290 --> 02:32:08,110
Looking forward to
reading your report. - Sir.

2151
02:32:47,570 --> 02:32:49,580
[Surje] 'What have you
guys done as such...'

2152
02:32:49,650 --> 02:32:52,200
...that he had to come
here to solve the issue?

2153
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:54,220
Surje, you can't joke always.

2154
02:32:54,390 --> 02:32:56,430
Bravo's number might be next.

2155
02:32:56,550 --> 02:32:58,750
Do you know the SF has
become very strict nowadays?

2156
02:32:58,960 --> 02:33:00,960
For every failure, a new
committee initiates an enquiry.

2157
02:33:01,170 --> 02:33:03,910
Everything is monitored
very closely, Surje.

2158
02:33:03,990 --> 02:33:06,070
A committee will be set up
if there is a failure.

2159
02:33:06,230 --> 02:33:09,130
Check the leader board. For now,
all the Bravos are in the top.

2160
02:33:28,380 --> 02:33:29,710
S**t.

2161
02:33:49,940 --> 02:33:51,610
What, Surje?
Again?

2162
02:33:55,530 --> 02:33:58,220
These are combat injuries.
They'll heal.

2163
02:34:01,980 --> 02:34:06,520
Sorry, Capt. Sharma.
Please take care of yourself.

2164
02:34:18,110 --> 02:34:20,110
Thank you for all
the support, guys.

2165
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:56,550
"Thanks for the support."

2166
02:34:57,760 --> 02:35:00,710
Was she thanking one of us
for sending that e-mail?

2167
02:35:02,010 --> 02:35:04,120
But why would any one
of us send that mail?

2168
02:35:04,310 --> 02:35:07,020
Yes. But when we have written
everything in the debrief...

2169
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:09,090
...what was in that e-mail?

2170
02:35:09,170 --> 02:35:12,400
We know what we wrote
in the debriefing.

2171
02:35:12,590 --> 02:35:14,230
We don't know what she has written.

2172
02:35:14,530 --> 02:35:18,210
But why would she send a mail if
she was writing it in the report?

2173
02:35:18,570 --> 02:35:21,220
I think someone else did this.
- Like who?

2174
02:35:22,630 --> 02:35:26,630
A friend or a well-wisher.

2175
02:35:29,650 --> 02:35:32,160
Well, Bilal was her
good friend amongst us.

2176
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:37,120
No, sir. Capt. Bilal can't do this.
He wrote what he was told.

2177
02:35:37,220 --> 02:35:41,360
Nobody told him.
He wrote what happened.

2178
02:35:43,700 --> 02:35:47,920
I hope... I hope we all
wrote what happened.

2179
02:36:12,690 --> 02:36:14,200
B******t, Imtiyaz!

2180
02:36:14,300 --> 02:36:15,940
I think you didn't read
the debriefs properly.

2181
02:36:16,020 --> 02:36:17,860
I read all the reports, sir.

2182
02:36:18,230 --> 02:36:20,580
And they are all worded
exactly the same.

2183
02:36:20,660 --> 02:36:22,040
Not a single word changed.

2184
02:36:22,130 --> 02:36:23,560
It means what Shikha has written...

2185
02:36:23,640 --> 02:36:25,840
...is what the entire Squad Alpha
wrote. Am I right?

2186
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:28,710
Right, sir.
- They are the SFTC commandos.

2187
02:36:29,070 --> 02:36:31,540
They are trained to remember
things even while asleep.

2188
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:34,740
If everyone has written the
same thing then this is the truth.

2189
02:36:38,180 --> 02:36:42,790
Even if I agree that everyone is
lying then what about Shikha?

2190
02:36:42,970 --> 02:36:46,020
Why is she lying?
- We need to find out that, sir.

2191
02:36:46,700 --> 02:36:49,330
Maybe she is being
pressurised to say this.

2192
02:36:49,430 --> 02:36:51,800
Or maybe it's all a cover-up.

2193
02:36:57,050 --> 02:37:02,220
Lt. Colonel Hussain,
are you pointing a finger at me?

2194
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:09,990
No, sir. All I'm saying is that
everyone is a suspect for me...

2195
02:37:10,070 --> 02:37:13,480
...and every reason is valid,
until the truth comes out.

2196
02:37:13,560 --> 02:37:17,080
This...
This is the truth, Imtiyaz.

2197
02:37:19,580 --> 02:37:21,140
If something like this
had happened...

2198
02:37:21,320 --> 02:37:24,640
...then I would have been
the first person to find it out.

2199
02:37:27,110 --> 02:37:29,080
Sir, with all due respect...

2200
02:37:30,220 --> 02:37:32,120
...either you co-operate
with me now...

2201
02:37:32,750 --> 02:37:34,930
...or wait for an official
investigation.

2202
02:37:40,180 --> 02:37:41,430
I see.

2203
02:37:53,810 --> 02:37:55,530
Lt. Colonel Hussain.

2204
02:37:57,060 --> 02:37:59,930
You and me, us...

2205
02:38:00,760 --> 02:38:04,580
...sitting in my office
and talking about this...

2206
02:38:05,640 --> 02:38:08,970
...means me
co-operating with you.

2207
02:38:14,470 --> 02:38:17,550
Do you think it'll be easy
to find out the truth?

2208
02:38:19,060 --> 02:38:20,770
They are the SFTC commandos.

2209
02:38:21,750 --> 02:38:24,940
If they have decided
to conceal the truth...

2210
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:30,040
...then they'll take it
to their graves.

2211
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:37,550
Cardinal rule of poker, sir.
If all the players are bluffing...

2212
02:38:37,610 --> 02:38:39,540
...we should raise the stakes.

2213
02:38:39,870 --> 02:38:43,370
So that the weakest player
folds first.

2214
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:48,190
[Locker opening]

2215
02:38:52,230 --> 02:38:53,800
[Locker closing]

2216
02:38:57,050 --> 02:38:59,900
"So, Bilal had multiple
fractures in the leg."

2217
02:38:59,980 --> 02:39:01,750
"Injury in his head
and concussion."

2218
02:39:01,830 --> 02:39:03,890
"Rohan had bruises
from falling on the rocks."

2219
02:39:04,010 --> 02:39:06,560
"And Vishnu's right side
was completely stiff."

2220
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:08,550
And Shikha?

2221
02:39:10,020 --> 02:39:13,020
Which side of Shikha's head
had wounds?

2222
02:39:13,780 --> 02:39:17,140
- Sir. It's all in the report, sir.
- Oh.

2223
02:39:19,490 --> 02:39:22,120
Yeah.
On the right.

2224
02:39:24,070 --> 02:39:26,290
- What is for lunch?
- What?

2225
02:39:26,370 --> 02:39:28,210
Smells like paratha.

2226
02:39:28,550 --> 02:39:29,920
Aloo paratha.

2227
02:39:33,730 --> 02:39:35,510
Sir, will you have it?

2228
02:39:35,590 --> 02:39:38,440
Now that you are insisting,
I'll have it. Fine.

2229
02:39:43,250 --> 02:39:48,410
Thank you. Clarified butter.

2230
02:39:49,210 --> 02:39:53,040
Are the doctors allowed to
have clarified butter? It's good.

2231
02:39:55,370 --> 02:39:58,130
What do you think after looking
at Capt. Shikha's injuries?

2232
02:39:58,700 --> 02:40:01,840
Are these regular combat injuries?

2233
02:40:02,370 --> 02:40:06,660
Yes, sir. According to the patient
these are combat injuries.

2234
02:40:06,740 --> 02:40:08,560
It could be sexual assault as well.

2235
02:40:08,950 --> 02:40:10,940
Well... I just told you, sir...

2236
02:40:11,020 --> 02:40:13,370
...that according to the patient,
they are combat injuries.

2237
02:40:13,450 --> 02:40:15,100
Are you a lawyer or a doctor?

2238
02:40:16,570 --> 02:40:21,040
Capt. Aparna, you very well know
how to catch someone lying.

2239
02:40:24,770 --> 02:40:27,590
The heart beats faster.

2240
02:40:28,700 --> 02:40:30,480
Are you sure that Capt. Shikha
didn't fall unconscious...

2241
02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:32,290
...because of some other reason?

2242
02:40:32,630 --> 02:40:34,800
- Like what, sir?
- It could be anything.

2243
02:40:35,320 --> 02:40:36,880
She could be pregnant.

2244
02:40:37,690 --> 02:40:41,470
Sorry, sir. But why
would she be pregnant?

2245
02:40:41,550 --> 02:40:43,360
There are lots of
good looking men around.

2246
02:40:43,440 --> 02:40:46,930
They all stay in the same dorm.
Surely she is not a virgin.

2247
02:40:47,730 --> 02:40:50,490
Sir, I can't believe you
just asked me this question.

2248
02:40:52,440 --> 02:40:56,320
Relax.
These are just routine questions.

2249
02:40:56,600 --> 02:40:59,830
Sir, would you ask these routine
questions if she were a man?

2250
02:40:59,910 --> 02:41:01,660
Would you have been able
to answer this question...

2251
02:41:01,870 --> 02:41:02,810
...if she were a man?

2252
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:07,870
Anyway, thank you.

2253
02:41:12,170 --> 02:41:14,660
Shikha's best quality
is that she is loyal.

2254
02:41:15,690 --> 02:41:19,300
She is loyal to her country.
She is loyal to her team.

2255
02:41:19,900 --> 02:41:21,860
And she is loyal to her boyfriend.

2256
02:41:22,190 --> 02:41:24,940
Loyalty is a strange quality,
Capt. Aparna.

2257
02:41:25,790 --> 02:41:29,720
You know, sometimes when
you are loyal to a person...

2258
02:41:30,140 --> 02:41:32,520
...you end up being disloyal
to the institution.

2259
02:41:33,090 --> 02:41:35,010
You understand what I am saying?

2260
02:41:36,670 --> 02:41:38,080
Yes, sir.

2261
02:41:38,970 --> 02:41:41,620
- Sir, I have patients waiting.
- Last question.

2262
02:41:42,850 --> 02:41:45,860
There were no nail marks on any
other member of Squad Alpha...

2263
02:41:45,960 --> 02:41:48,900
...other than Capt. Shikha.
Am I right?

2264
02:41:50,530 --> 02:41:51,800
Yes, sir.

2265
02:41:54,810 --> 02:41:58,830
Check your pulse rate,
Capt. Aparna. It's quite fast.

2266
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:11,060
Capt. Shikha Sharma has a
boyfriend. Study boyfriend.

2267
02:42:11,360 --> 02:42:14,850
And RMO Capt. Aparna is trying
to hide something for sure.

2268
02:42:24,150 --> 02:42:27,080
Listen. Show me the register.
- Yes.

2269
02:42:27,510 --> 02:42:29,500
- Who are you, sir?
- Police Special Branch.

2270
02:42:31,410 --> 02:42:32,910
What happened, sir?

2271
02:42:38,580 --> 02:42:41,430
4th July,
Saturday night at 10:01...

2272
02:42:41,510 --> 02:42:43,290
...this mail was sent
from this IP address.

2273
02:42:43,380 --> 02:42:45,410
But there is no entry
for that time in this register.

2274
02:42:45,540 --> 02:42:49,430
It's a crime to use cyber cafe
without an ID. You know it, right?

2275
02:42:49,730 --> 02:42:51,720
Sir, it's the closing time.

2276
02:42:51,870 --> 02:42:55,210
- Sometimes it happens.
- "Sometimes."

2277
02:42:55,930 --> 02:42:58,700
I am sure, that time must
have been chosen on purpose.

2278
02:42:59,750 --> 02:43:02,190
Try to recall.
It happened last week.

2279
02:43:02,580 --> 02:43:04,580
It's a small town. I'm sure
many people don't come here.

2280
02:43:04,680 --> 02:43:06,370
Try to recollect who it was.

2281
02:43:09,340 --> 02:43:13,580
A tall guy, fair, muscular.
With the crutches...

2282
02:43:13,660 --> 02:43:15,680
I mean, he must have been
using crutches to walk.

2283
02:43:18,250 --> 02:43:21,630
Yes, sir.
A tall man had come here.

2284
02:43:21,730 --> 02:43:24,830
- Tall?
- Yes, sir. Tall.

2285
02:43:25,180 --> 02:43:28,920
He was wearing a jacket.

2286
02:43:29,500 --> 02:43:33,920
There was a muffler
around his neck.

2287
02:43:33,980 --> 02:43:36,020
- Just...
- Muffler?

2288
02:43:36,090 --> 02:43:38,490
Yes, sir. It was of this colour.
Red colour.

2289
02:43:46,770 --> 02:43:47,770
This...

2290
02:43:48,480 --> 02:43:51,300
Sir, it's not working
since two months.

2291
02:43:54,380 --> 02:43:55,790
Here is what you can do.

2292
02:43:55,880 --> 02:43:59,300
- Close this cyber cafe as well.
- What, sir?

2293
02:44:00,320 --> 02:44:02,120
[Car moving]

2294
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:04,550
[Imtiyaz] 'It is said
that in war as in poker...'

2295
02:44:04,620 --> 02:44:06,340
[Imtiyaz] '...if you
want to win...'

2296
02:44:06,420 --> 02:44:09,160
...you should know the strengths
and weaknesses of each other.

2297
02:44:09,940 --> 02:44:11,950
And you all have...

2298
02:44:13,340 --> 02:44:14,820
...overcome Dozakh together.

2299
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:20,580
But do you really know each
other? So, your task today is...

2300
02:44:20,930 --> 02:44:24,150
...to write down the strengths and
weaknesses of your course mates...

2301
02:44:24,230 --> 02:44:27,950
...in these forms. Through this,
we will collate the data...

2302
02:44:28,110 --> 02:44:31,220
...and make your
psychological profiles.

2303
02:44:31,300 --> 02:44:34,740
And don't worry.
Your views will be confidential.

2304
02:44:35,540 --> 02:44:38,660
So please, be brutal.

2305
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:43,930
[Imtiyaz] 'Red ones for strength.
Blue for weaknesses.'

2306
02:44:44,210 --> 02:44:46,510
And your time starts now.

2307
02:45:08,060 --> 02:45:09,840
[Surje] 'B*******d.'

2308
02:45:12,510 --> 02:45:14,560
This is betrayal, boss.

2309
02:45:16,440 --> 02:45:18,820
That s***a said that the reports
would be confidential.

2310
02:45:19,030 --> 02:45:20,640
And he leaked it so easily.

2311
02:45:23,550 --> 02:45:26,140
What is this, Vishnu?
You think I am horny.

2312
02:45:26,710 --> 02:45:29,450
Just because I crack jokes,
you wrote this in my report!

2313
02:45:29,720 --> 02:45:31,730
Joking around is fine
among ourselves, Vishnu.

2314
02:45:32,340 --> 02:45:34,190
You know this will f**k my ACR.

2315
02:45:34,250 --> 02:45:36,550
Surje, sorry.
I thought it's confidential...

2316
02:45:36,630 --> 02:45:38,290
Whatever I'm, I'm upfront.

2317
02:45:38,380 --> 02:45:40,870
I am not like you guys.
God knows what you guys did...

2318
02:45:41,060 --> 02:45:43,530
...that the James Bond had to
come for the combing operation.

2319
02:45:45,090 --> 02:45:46,780
You think I don't
deserve to be here.

2320
02:45:47,010 --> 02:45:49,300
I am taking advantage
of my dad being a general!

2321
02:45:49,630 --> 02:45:52,320
I've cleared every obstacle
of the special forces...

2322
02:45:52,440 --> 02:45:54,050
...and that too with
flying colours, Tank.

2323
02:45:54,120 --> 02:45:56,040
Not my dad.
You get it?

2324
02:45:59,910 --> 02:46:01,620
F*****g lunatic.

2325
02:46:11,280 --> 02:46:14,470
- Sir, what does this mean?
- Lack of initiative.

2326
02:46:14,550 --> 02:46:16,810
Sir, why? Because I am a
soldier and not an officer...

2327
02:46:16,890 --> 02:46:19,030
...you think I can't
take good decision.

2328
02:46:19,110 --> 02:46:20,130
This is not true, Tej.

2329
02:46:20,310 --> 02:46:22,310
And before saying anything
to me look at your report.

2330
02:46:22,400 --> 02:46:24,730
What is this?
"Capt. Manit is not a team player!"

2331
02:46:24,970 --> 02:46:26,430
- Really, Tej?
- Yes, sir.

2332
02:46:26,520 --> 02:46:28,930
You do what you think is right.
You don't listen to anyone.

2333
02:46:28,990 --> 02:46:31,040
I'm not the only one who says this.
Everyone says this.

2334
02:46:31,120 --> 02:46:32,490
Actually, you are right.

2335
02:46:32,920 --> 02:46:35,010
I shouldn't have written
lack of initiative.

2336
02:46:35,440 --> 02:46:37,430
I should have written careless.

2337
02:46:37,710 --> 02:46:41,830
As far as I remember you lost
your magazine during Dozakh.

2338
02:46:41,930 --> 02:46:45,300
But sir, you told me to hide
this from Capt. Shikha.

2339
02:46:45,380 --> 02:46:47,510
- F*****g idiot.
- Boys...

2340
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:50,620
Relax. This is the Indian army.
We have a decorum here.

2341
02:46:53,580 --> 02:46:55,610
Colonel Sathe is testing us.

2342
02:46:55,850 --> 02:46:57,470
[Tank] 'So that we react this way.'

2343
02:46:57,830 --> 02:46:59,450
Please don't fall for it.

2344
02:47:00,560 --> 02:47:03,850
Not Colonel Sathe. Lt. Colonel
Imtiyaz Hussain. He has done it.

2345
02:47:04,020 --> 02:47:05,470
And this is not the last time.

2346
02:47:05,770 --> 02:47:08,480
I have a feeling, he will
try to trick us like this again.

2347
02:47:08,670 --> 02:47:12,750
Unbelievable, Imtiyaz. You leaked
the psychological profile reports!

2348
02:47:12,930 --> 02:47:15,720
I just gave you the permission
to conduct a class.

2349
02:47:15,810 --> 02:47:18,170
- And I took them to task.
- Imtiyaz.

2350
02:47:18,700 --> 02:47:20,620
This is completely unacceptable.

2351
02:47:20,700 --> 02:47:22,420
This could create
a rift amongst them.

2352
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:25,400
We are trying to unite them
and not separate.

2353
02:47:25,500 --> 02:47:27,660
Sir, the team
which breaks so easily...

2354
02:47:27,820 --> 02:47:29,700
...is not worthy to be
in the special forces.

2355
02:47:30,170 --> 02:47:30,890
What do you mean?

2356
02:47:30,980 --> 02:47:34,370
Only Squad Alpha knows
what happened in Dozakh.

2357
02:47:34,450 --> 02:47:35,800
And sir, my gut feeling says...

2358
02:47:35,880 --> 02:47:38,710
...that even RMO, Aparna does
not have the entire picture.

2359
02:47:41,510 --> 02:47:42,790
Imtiyaz.

2360
02:47:44,610 --> 02:47:47,620
You have my full support
for the investigation.

2361
02:47:47,780 --> 02:47:51,340
But there is a code
of honour in the army.

2362
02:47:52,080 --> 02:47:53,170
Which is sacrosanct...

2363
02:47:53,250 --> 02:47:54,910
...and which is above anything.

2364
02:47:55,220 --> 02:47:56,870
I agree with you, sir.

2365
02:47:57,170 --> 02:47:59,070
But with all due respect...

2366
02:47:59,140 --> 02:48:02,860
...is this code of honour more
important than a lady's honour?

2367
02:48:04,250 --> 02:48:05,730
Sir, something has happened.

2368
02:48:05,830 --> 02:48:08,370
And either the one who sent
the e-mail can tell me this...

2369
02:48:08,450 --> 02:48:10,950
...or Capt. Shikha herself.

2370
02:48:11,240 --> 02:48:14,430
And right now, both...
Both are lying, sir.

2371
02:48:21,940 --> 02:48:26,030
Reports look good.
Your progress is also good.

2372
02:48:26,460 --> 02:48:28,490
I am from Haryana.
It is in my blood.

2373
02:48:30,070 --> 02:48:32,010
Thank you for everything, Aparna.

2374
02:48:34,830 --> 02:48:38,280
Shikha, Colonel Imtiyaz
came here to meet me.

2375
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:44,370
What did he say?

2376
02:48:45,910 --> 02:48:47,090
He didn't say anything.

2377
02:48:48,570 --> 02:48:51,660
But he had some very
disturbing questions.

2378
02:48:53,280 --> 02:48:54,520
Like.

2379
02:49:25,910 --> 02:49:28,370
-[Shikha] 'May I come in, sir?'
- Yes.

2380
02:49:28,470 --> 02:49:29,280
[Door opening]

2381
02:49:31,620 --> 02:49:33,610
- Sir.
- At ease.

2382
02:49:40,970 --> 02:49:43,130
You are asking questions
about me from everyone, sir.

2383
02:49:43,210 --> 02:49:44,920
So, I thought I myself
should come here, sir.

2384
02:49:48,930 --> 02:49:50,430
I don't play poker, sir.

2385
02:49:50,950 --> 02:49:52,120
I used to play with
catapult when I was a kid...

2386
02:49:52,180 --> 02:49:55,070
...and I am now, a shooter.
I prefer talking to the point, sir.

2387
02:50:00,380 --> 02:50:01,850
Point taken, Capt. Sharma.

2388
02:50:02,570 --> 02:50:05,010
So, why don't you tell me
the truth point-blank?

2389
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:06,910
The truth is, sir
that I am a Belieber.

2390
02:50:06,980 --> 02:50:08,470
"What do you mean"
is my favourite song.

2391
02:50:08,550 --> 02:50:10,160
Pink has always been
my favourite colour.

2392
02:50:10,260 --> 02:50:11,900
I'm not a virgin.
I'm sexually active.

2393
02:50:11,980 --> 02:50:13,950
I have a steady boyfriend
but I'm not promiscuous.

2394
02:50:14,030 --> 02:50:16,150
And I never got pregnant
till date, sir.

2395
02:50:20,700 --> 02:50:24,280
Well, I am not asking
about all this.

2396
02:50:24,910 --> 02:50:29,330
But okay. Now that we are talking,
why don't you tell me?

2397
02:50:29,760 --> 02:50:32,520
You seem to be very
emotional about...

2398
02:50:32,580 --> 02:50:35,100
What's his name? Shivalik.

2399
02:50:36,020 --> 02:50:38,400
But you didn't even call him
after Dozakh.

2400
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:41,220
You didn't even tell him
what happened with you.

2401
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:46,710
I really appreciate the fact
that you worked really hard...

2402
02:50:46,830 --> 02:50:49,190
...to get the records
of my messages and calls.

2403
02:50:49,630 --> 02:50:52,460
But if you think that owing to such
tactics I'll become emotional...

2404
02:50:52,540 --> 02:50:55,770
...and I'll crack,
it's not going to happen, sir.

2405
02:50:57,070 --> 02:50:59,770
Till date I never met a lady
who is not emotional.

2406
02:50:59,870 --> 02:51:02,770
Women are emotional, sir
but they are also smart.

2407
02:51:03,140 --> 02:51:07,600
Like your ex-wife, sir.
Pardon me, sir. But...

2408
02:51:07,690 --> 02:51:09,570
Maybe that is why she left you.

2409
02:51:12,630 --> 02:51:14,280
Military Intelligence, sir.

2410
02:51:15,060 --> 02:51:17,580
Handpicked after
rigorous deep selection.

2411
02:51:20,810 --> 02:51:25,070
What happened, sir? Aren't you
used to intelligent women?

2412
02:51:29,690 --> 02:51:31,470
To be intelligent and to
think others as stupid...

2413
02:51:31,550 --> 02:51:33,580
...are two different things.

2414
02:51:34,300 --> 02:51:37,650
You think I don't know who
leaked the strategy class reports?

2415
02:51:38,690 --> 02:51:40,780
I know you have friends in MI.

2416
02:51:40,990 --> 02:51:44,600
Capt. Sharma, I know that
something has happened with you.

2417
02:51:44,720 --> 02:51:46,790
And you are taking revenge
by leaking the reports.

2418
02:51:48,020 --> 02:51:51,230
But if you tell me, I can help you.

2419
02:51:51,610 --> 02:51:56,340
- I can help you.
- I don't want anyone's help, sir.

2420
02:51:57,090 --> 02:51:59,470
You can carry on
with your investigation.

2421
02:51:59,860 --> 02:52:02,350
The one who sent the e-mail
might tell you something.

2422
02:52:02,460 --> 02:52:04,260
Maybe you sent that e-mail.

2423
02:52:06,090 --> 02:52:07,770
You may leave, Capt. Sharma.

2424
02:52:12,330 --> 02:52:16,420
One thing that I like the
most about Colonel Sathe.

2425
02:52:16,920 --> 02:52:18,530
He loves reverse psychology.

2426
02:52:18,620 --> 02:52:21,000
Red form and blue form
in the psychological tests...

2427
02:52:21,080 --> 02:52:23,310
Blue wire and red wire
in the bomb test...

2428
02:52:23,420 --> 02:52:26,580
Blue means enemies,
red means friends.

2429
02:52:28,840 --> 02:52:31,050
Blue wire was supposed
to be cut, Capt. Sharma.

2430
02:52:31,440 --> 02:52:34,830
But as per everyone's debriefs,
the red wire was cut.

2431
02:52:35,460 --> 02:52:36,620
[Imtiyaz] 'Why?'

2432
02:52:37,370 --> 02:52:39,470
Manit, I have an instinct.

2433
02:52:39,550 --> 02:52:40,850
It's reverse psychology.
Go with the blue.

2434
02:52:40,930 --> 02:52:42,490
- What about logic?
- Manit, blue.

2435
02:52:42,570 --> 02:52:44,430
- Red.
- Blue. - Red!

2436
02:52:47,460 --> 02:52:48,640
[All] 'Raju...'

2437
02:52:48,720 --> 02:52:50,260
Raju, here...
Back...

2438
02:52:50,340 --> 02:52:51,920
Tank, back.
Back...

2439
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:53,490
Manit, back.
Manit, back.

2440
02:52:55,020 --> 02:52:56,110
Capt. Shikha.

2441
02:52:56,370 --> 02:52:57,330
Come, let's play a game.

2442
02:52:57,610 --> 02:52:58,770
I don't play games, dude.

2443
02:52:58,850 --> 02:52:59,870
I am a sportsman.

2444
02:53:00,350 --> 02:53:03,600
Well, I must appreciate your
sportsman spirit, Capt. Manit.

2445
02:53:05,660 --> 02:53:06,720
What do you mean?

2446
02:53:06,800 --> 02:53:08,550
Which wire did you cut
during bomb defusal?

2447
02:53:08,630 --> 02:53:09,670
Red or blue?

2448
02:53:11,600 --> 02:53:13,570
Capt. Manit, red or blue?

2449
02:53:16,300 --> 02:53:18,220
Red or blue?

2450
02:53:21,100 --> 02:53:21,930
Blue.

2451
02:53:24,910 --> 02:53:27,000
You told us that
you cut the red wire.

2452
02:53:27,980 --> 02:53:29,300
Why did you lie to everyone?

2453
02:53:30,780 --> 02:53:32,030
Is this your team spirit?

2454
02:53:32,410 --> 02:53:34,580
You didn't want to give up
in front of a girl.

2455
02:53:36,750 --> 02:53:38,730
Your male ego couldn't handle this.

2456
02:53:38,810 --> 02:53:41,160
Sir, you said that
you cut the red wire.

2457
02:53:41,310 --> 02:53:42,390
[Tank] Red wire?

2458
02:53:43,280 --> 02:53:45,270
Even in our task, blue
was the right wire.

2459
02:53:47,660 --> 02:53:48,870
As my 2IC...

2460
02:53:49,080 --> 02:53:52,290
...you must have a very good
reason to tell a lie like this.

2461
02:53:52,640 --> 02:53:54,460
Please enlighten us.
We are all waiting.

2462
02:53:57,900 --> 02:53:59,620
- I lied for the team.
- Sorry?

2463
02:54:00,390 --> 02:54:03,320
- For the team?
- With all due respect.

2464
02:54:03,640 --> 02:54:05,750
You took a wrong decision first.

2465
02:54:05,890 --> 02:54:07,610
Because of which
we lost a lot of time.

2466
02:54:07,820 --> 02:54:09,250
And we didn't even
get our supplies.

2467
02:54:10,430 --> 02:54:11,590
So, after a point I felt...

2468
02:54:11,670 --> 02:54:13,930
...Rohan should be our
team leader instead of you.

2469
02:54:16,330 --> 02:54:18,340
He was the best amongst us,
Capt. Shikha.

2470
02:54:19,490 --> 02:54:20,910
Are you the commandant here?

2471
02:54:22,140 --> 02:54:25,880
Will you decide who should
be the leader of which team?

2472
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:29,270
I was not the only one.
We all thought so.

2473
02:54:30,340 --> 02:54:31,340
Even Bilal.

2474
02:54:34,180 --> 02:54:36,630
Anyway, what difference
does it make...

2475
02:54:36,710 --> 02:54:37,590
...if I cut the red wire or blue?

2476
02:54:38,520 --> 02:54:40,670
The fact is we were all safe.

2477
02:54:41,470 --> 02:54:43,120
Isn't that what matters?
What say, guys?

2478
02:54:43,400 --> 02:54:45,560
Hey. Good that you
were not in our team.

2479
02:54:45,760 --> 02:54:47,490
She is asking you nicely.

2480
02:54:47,620 --> 02:54:50,400
Whereas the Squad Bravo
would've done your kambal parade.

2481
02:54:52,610 --> 02:54:53,610
You are safe.

2482
02:54:56,940 --> 02:55:00,000
If you want, you can
complain to Colonel Sathe.

2483
02:55:01,560 --> 02:55:02,830
Vishnu, even you
were with him, right?

2484
02:55:05,080 --> 02:55:06,570
B*******d, even you
didn't tell the truth.

2485
02:55:22,510 --> 02:55:23,430
Shikha.

2486
02:55:24,290 --> 02:55:25,410
Shikha, stop please.

2487
02:55:26,990 --> 02:55:28,200
Shikha, listen to me.
Shikha.

2488
02:55:28,840 --> 02:55:30,070
Shame on you, man.

2489
02:55:30,310 --> 02:55:31,570
Why did you do this to me?

2490
02:55:32,490 --> 02:55:34,230
I was wrong during
the navigation exercise.

2491
02:55:34,310 --> 02:55:35,120
You were right.

2492
02:55:35,200 --> 02:55:37,220
But seriously.
This!

2493
02:55:37,760 --> 02:55:39,470
How do you look at yourself
in the mirror?

2494
02:55:39,890 --> 02:55:41,810
- I'm really sorry, Shikha.
- It's too late.

2495
02:55:42,570 --> 02:55:45,440
Such a big lie!
Why?

2496
02:55:46,740 --> 02:55:47,920
Shikha, I'm sorry.

2497
02:55:49,190 --> 02:55:51,500
And believe me, it's not about you.

2498
02:55:52,770 --> 02:55:55,470
There is one more lie,
bigger than that...

2499
02:55:57,490 --> 02:55:58,440
...which I am hiding.

2500
02:56:02,490 --> 02:56:04,830
Shikha, my whole
f*****g life is a lie.

2501
02:56:05,410 --> 02:56:06,540
I am gay.

2502
02:56:09,550 --> 02:56:11,170
- Red. Red!
- Blue.

2503
02:56:12,190 --> 02:56:16,930
-[Manit] 'We are safe!'
- Hurray!

2504
02:56:17,350 --> 02:56:19,360
Die another day, b****h!

2505
02:56:25,490 --> 02:56:26,860
- You said...
- Hush.

2506
02:56:31,300 --> 02:56:34,160
Everyone has their own
secrets, Capt. Vishnu.

2507
02:56:34,610 --> 02:56:36,270
Someone lies to save his life...

2508
02:56:36,980 --> 02:56:38,350
...whereas others,
to save their jobs.

2509
02:56:38,820 --> 02:56:39,970
Remember the bartender?

2510
02:56:43,410 --> 02:56:45,960
- So, where are you from?
- From Bangalore.

2511
02:56:46,600 --> 02:56:49,590
What is the matter, bro?
Time for some cocktail?

2512
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:53,220
[Vishnu] 'Manit knew my secret.'

2513
02:56:53,740 --> 02:56:55,940
[Vishnu] 'And if anyone in
the army comes to know...'

2514
02:56:56,250 --> 02:56:57,950
[Vishnu] '...it was the end
of my career, Shikha.'

2515
02:56:58,700 --> 02:56:59,890
[Vishnu] 'While growing up...'

2516
02:57:00,440 --> 02:57:02,580
[Vishnu] '...I thought it's
just a passing phase.'

2517
02:57:03,570 --> 02:57:04,580
And I tried.

2518
02:57:05,820 --> 02:57:06,890
I tried a lot...

2519
02:57:07,870 --> 02:57:10,610
...to fit in, to be macho,
to be a man.

2520
02:57:11,990 --> 02:57:13,220
I even joined the army.

2521
02:57:14,350 --> 02:57:16,030
But I guess, I am what I am.

2522
02:57:17,790 --> 02:57:19,410
And every passing day...

2523
02:57:20,250 --> 02:57:22,230
...it's being difficult for me
to hide this truth, Shikha.

2524
02:57:23,490 --> 02:57:24,680
Please try to understand.
I'm...

2525
02:57:25,560 --> 02:57:26,880
I'm really sorry for this.

2526
02:57:29,910 --> 02:57:31,290
Capt. Vishnu Soren.

2527
02:57:31,890 --> 02:57:35,360
You were attached with
Bihar Regiment for three years.

2528
02:57:36,320 --> 02:57:39,000
- What is their motto?
- Work is worship.

2529
02:57:39,180 --> 02:57:40,220
Work is worship.

2530
02:57:41,100 --> 02:57:43,470
I was faced with the same
dilemma after Dozakh.

2531
02:57:43,740 --> 02:57:46,790
Should I sign the exit form
or continue my job?

2532
02:57:48,860 --> 02:57:50,380
You are a decorated officer.

2533
02:57:52,400 --> 02:57:54,540
You were selected
for the special forces.

2534
02:57:54,830 --> 02:57:56,360
There must be
something special in you.

2535
02:57:58,230 --> 02:58:01,260
Vishnu, our deeds defines us.

2536
02:58:03,020 --> 02:58:06,880
Not your sexuality
and not my gender.

2537
02:58:19,090 --> 02:58:20,030
You were right, sir.

2538
02:58:20,850 --> 02:58:22,570
Capt. Sharma is a tough cookie.

2539
02:58:23,570 --> 02:58:25,310
I'm hardly left with
more cards to play.

2540
02:58:25,540 --> 02:58:27,440
It means you
finally met your match.

2541
02:58:27,680 --> 02:58:28,640
I am really intrigued, sir...

2542
02:58:28,720 --> 02:58:30,070
...as to why she
is hiding all this.

2543
02:58:30,470 --> 02:58:31,730
What could be the reason?

2544
02:58:33,130 --> 02:58:34,090
Imtiyaz.

2545
02:58:34,490 --> 02:58:36,700
Defence minister is coming
for the POP.

2546
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:40,630
In fact she wants to induct
an all women battalion...

2547
02:58:40,710 --> 02:58:42,150
...in the army.

2548
02:58:42,360 --> 02:58:46,520
Shikha's case is very important
for the future of the Indian army.

2549
02:58:46,600 --> 02:58:48,480
Sir, I tried stealth and surprise.

2550
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:49,980
But Shikha didn't fall for it.

2551
02:58:50,630 --> 02:58:53,070
I think I should try
some guerrilla tactics.

2552
02:58:53,990 --> 02:58:55,790
Something to grab her by the balls.

2553
02:58:57,220 --> 02:58:59,660
You have a really complicated
relationship with women.

2554
02:58:59,740 --> 02:59:00,660
[Raman] 'Don't you?'

2555
02:59:00,740 --> 02:59:03,280
Not really, sir.
It's quiet straightforward.

2556
02:59:03,910 --> 02:59:06,120
Anyway, Imtiyaz, keep me updated.

2557
02:59:06,560 --> 02:59:07,510
Sure, sir.

2558
02:59:24,060 --> 02:59:26,830
Hi, Vikram.
I need a favour, dude.

2559
02:59:27,920 --> 02:59:31,780
Yeah.
The number is 9814...

2560
02:59:31,860 --> 02:59:34,210
I told you that I was very
busy the last few days.

2561
02:59:34,290 --> 02:59:36,470
So, I couldn't call you.
Yes...

2562
02:59:37,250 --> 02:59:38,170
You tell me.

2563
02:59:38,250 --> 02:59:39,150
That's it.

2564
02:59:39,230 --> 02:59:40,740
Yes. Fine.
Dad.

2565
02:59:40,820 --> 02:59:41,800
He must have gone out.

2566
02:59:44,330 --> 02:59:46,350
Okay, fine.
I need to go, Mom.

2567
02:59:46,850 --> 02:59:49,150
Yes. You take care.
I am fit.

2568
02:59:49,230 --> 02:59:50,730
You don't need to worry at all.

2569
02:59:51,270 --> 02:59:52,260
Okay?
Fine.

2570
02:59:52,340 --> 02:59:53,640
Bye, Mom.
Bye...

2571
03:00:03,740 --> 03:00:04,810
After going to the academy...

2572
03:00:04,900 --> 03:00:07,180
...it's the first time Shikha
messaged me and called me, friend.

2573
03:00:07,260 --> 03:00:08,140
This has to be perfect.

2574
03:00:08,220 --> 03:00:09,900
[Man1] Lucky night, bro.

2575
03:00:10,180 --> 03:00:12,060
Dude, Shikha is not
like other girls.

2576
03:00:12,140 --> 03:00:14,170
One second.
This has to be perfect.

2577
03:00:14,330 --> 03:00:15,410
Candles, check.

2578
03:00:16,320 --> 03:00:18,050
Music volume, perfect.

2579
03:00:18,310 --> 03:00:19,260
It's looking good.

2580
03:00:19,670 --> 03:00:22,590
Dude, which oil did you send?
Eucalyptus?

2581
03:00:22,830 --> 03:00:24,100
It was told in the school...

2582
03:00:24,180 --> 03:00:25,080
...that its bark is
used to make paper.

2583
03:00:25,160 --> 03:00:27,300
[Man1] Not paper, bro.
Mood.

2584
03:00:27,380 --> 03:00:28,510
[Man1] 100 percent successful.

2585
03:00:28,630 --> 03:00:29,330
Okay. I hope so.
[Door bell ringing]

2586
03:00:29,420 --> 03:00:30,230
One second.

2587
03:00:30,310 --> 03:00:31,930
Listen.
I think she is here.

2588
03:00:32,010 --> 03:00:33,130
I'm going to call you back.
Okay?

2589
03:00:33,210 --> 03:00:34,110
Bye...

2590
03:00:36,150 --> 03:00:37,170
[Door opening]

2591
03:00:43,560 --> 03:00:44,470
[Door closing]

2592
03:00:54,400 --> 03:00:55,510
Boo!
[Screams]

2593
03:00:57,030 --> 03:00:58,370
- Got you.
- What the f**k?

2594
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:01,240
- Hi! - What kind of childish
behaviour is this?

2595
03:01:01,320 --> 03:01:02,370
What's wrong with you?

2596
03:01:02,450 --> 03:01:04,300
Sorry, dude.
Look at the decoration.

2597
03:01:04,380 --> 03:01:06,320
Look... Why did you
switch on the light?

2598
03:01:07,720 --> 03:01:08,700
Sorry.

2599
03:01:10,190 --> 03:01:11,160
Sorry.

2600
03:01:14,990 --> 03:01:16,980
I had told you
that I was very busy.

2601
03:01:17,700 --> 03:01:18,750
What happened?

2602
03:01:20,220 --> 03:01:21,780
- You told me that...
- What?

2603
03:01:23,730 --> 03:01:24,890
- You said...
- What?

2604
03:01:27,970 --> 03:01:28,850
Are you all right?

2605
03:01:33,750 --> 03:01:35,320
This is a very bad idea, Shivalik.

2606
03:01:36,700 --> 03:01:37,700
I'm going back.

2607
03:01:37,810 --> 03:01:39,020
Hey, Shikha.
Listen...

2608
03:01:40,750 --> 03:01:42,370
I have been really
worried about you.

2609
03:01:43,070 --> 03:01:44,050
It's okay, dude.

2610
03:01:44,590 --> 03:01:46,320
- How are you?
- Very good.

2611
03:01:47,830 --> 03:01:49,340
- What happened here?
- It's nothing.

2612
03:01:51,880 --> 03:01:53,000
I missed you so much.

2613
03:01:55,460 --> 03:01:57,730
- So...
- Stop it, Shivalik.

2614
03:01:59,070 --> 03:02:00,550
Don't you understand?

2615
03:02:02,090 --> 03:02:03,300
We are meeting
after so many days.

2616
03:02:03,380 --> 03:02:04,860
So what?

2617
03:02:06,060 --> 03:02:07,950
Is this the first thing
you think about?

2618
03:02:09,610 --> 03:02:10,860
Shikha, why are you
reacting like this?

2619
03:02:12,390 --> 03:02:13,920
I thought you are stressed so...

2620
03:02:14,680 --> 03:02:16,110
Just wanted you to relax.
That's it.

2621
03:02:16,190 --> 03:02:17,710
Is this the only way to relax?

2622
03:02:18,580 --> 03:02:20,350
- Shikha, enough.
- Enough of what?

2623
03:02:20,870 --> 03:02:23,490
We can meet outside, right?
For coffee or dinner?

2624
03:02:23,700 --> 03:02:25,800
Why do we always meet
in the hotel rooms?

2625
03:02:26,550 --> 03:02:27,400
What are you trying to say?

2626
03:02:27,480 --> 03:02:30,300
That your candles, this music,
your massage oils...

2627
03:02:30,380 --> 03:02:31,810
...is all f*****g b******t.

2628
03:02:31,890 --> 03:02:33,360
It is just a means to an end.

2629
03:02:33,530 --> 03:02:35,230
Only one thing is
important for you.

2630
03:02:35,310 --> 03:02:36,750
That you get what you want.

2631
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:40,740
Whether I want it or not,
how do I feel about it...

2632
03:02:40,920 --> 03:02:42,100
All that doesn't matter.

2633
03:02:43,130 --> 03:02:45,980
You will never understand,
Shivalik...

2634
03:02:46,060 --> 03:02:47,420
...what I actually go through.

2635
03:02:47,660 --> 03:02:49,840
You have a comfortable 9 to 5 job.

2636
03:02:50,210 --> 03:02:52,380
You sleep till 12 o'clock
on the weekends.

2637
03:02:52,460 --> 03:02:54,130
And you think everyone's life
is the same.

2638
03:02:54,210 --> 03:02:55,600
What the f**k is wrong with you?

2639
03:02:56,260 --> 03:02:57,230
Will you say whatever you want to?

2640
03:02:57,690 --> 03:02:59,590
You got no business to judge
me like this by the way.

2641
03:03:00,210 --> 03:03:02,560
I stood by you throughout
everything in your life.

2642
03:03:02,640 --> 03:03:03,700
Even today I left everything
and came here...

2643
03:03:03,780 --> 03:03:04,640
...as you sent me a text.

2644
03:03:04,720 --> 03:03:06,510
I thought it will bring
a smile to your face.

2645
03:03:06,820 --> 03:03:07,750
I thought you need me.

2646
03:03:07,830 --> 03:03:09,670
But no, I was wrong.
Because you are selfish.

2647
03:03:09,850 --> 03:03:11,410
You are downright selfish.

2648
03:03:12,300 --> 03:03:13,270
That's right.

2649
03:03:14,560 --> 03:03:17,340
This relationship is about you.

2650
03:03:18,260 --> 03:03:19,650
What do you want?
What are your needs?

2651
03:03:19,730 --> 03:03:21,000
Did you ever think about me?

2652
03:03:22,330 --> 03:03:23,400
"Shivalik, how are you?"

2653
03:03:23,480 --> 03:03:24,500
"How is your work?"

2654
03:03:24,590 --> 03:03:25,820
"Are you all right?
Are you happy?"

2655
03:03:27,140 --> 03:03:28,100
You know what?

2656
03:03:28,240 --> 03:03:29,710
You keep this attitude of yours.

2657
03:03:30,430 --> 03:03:31,450
Because I am leaving.

2658
03:03:31,720 --> 03:03:32,950
Yeah, get lost.

2659
03:03:33,030 --> 03:03:35,420
- You know. See you...
- I don't need you anyway.

2660
03:03:35,500 --> 03:03:37,430
I don't need anybody, Shivalik.

2661
03:03:41,570 --> 03:03:42,800
F**k!

2662
03:03:49,470 --> 03:03:51,580
[Car speeding]

2663
03:04:17,420 --> 03:04:18,490
Well played, sir.

2664
03:04:19,480 --> 03:04:20,450
Well played.

2665
03:04:20,840 --> 03:04:23,760
You can hack our phones
and message us, sir.

2666
03:04:24,050 --> 03:04:25,890
But you can never
hack into my brain.

2667
03:04:26,120 --> 03:04:27,660
Never say never, Capt. Sharma.

2668
03:04:28,820 --> 03:04:31,750
Well, if you just tell me
what happened that day...

2669
03:04:31,830 --> 03:04:33,640
...I won't need to do all this.

2670
03:04:33,850 --> 03:04:35,980
My answer will
remain the same, sir.

2671
03:04:36,920 --> 03:04:38,760
Nothing happened that day.

2672
03:04:38,840 --> 03:04:41,700
Most of the domestic abuse
victims say the same thing.

2673
03:04:42,560 --> 03:04:45,460
"I slipped from the stairs and
got hurt. Nothing else happened."

2674
03:04:45,650 --> 03:04:49,840
My injuries are regular
combat injuries, sir.

2675
03:04:49,920 --> 03:04:53,070
And, the injuries and wounds
about which you aren't talking.

2676
03:04:53,190 --> 03:04:55,080
The wounds on your soul.
What about that?

2677
03:04:55,500 --> 03:04:56,940
Who assaulted you, Capt. Sharma?

2678
03:04:57,120 --> 03:04:58,550
Who made you feel
less than an officer?

2679
03:04:58,630 --> 03:04:59,690
Tell me.
Answer me.

2680
03:05:01,520 --> 03:05:04,090
I saw how you handled
Capt. Manit's lie.

2681
03:05:04,170 --> 03:05:05,580
And now, you are lying.

2682
03:05:05,660 --> 03:05:07,100
Why such double standards?

2683
03:05:11,010 --> 03:05:14,040
I never thought you will
turn out to be that type.

2684
03:05:15,800 --> 03:05:18,800
The type that choses
ambition over self-respect.

2685
03:05:19,530 --> 03:05:21,280
"Boss touched my thigh.
So what?"

2686
03:05:21,770 --> 03:05:23,150
"Next promotion is mine."

2687
03:05:23,270 --> 03:05:26,080
"Superior at work place
wants to sleep with me."

2688
03:05:26,580 --> 03:05:27,370
"It's okay."

2689
03:05:27,450 --> 03:05:28,800
"At least the
corner office is mine."

2690
03:05:29,990 --> 03:05:32,320
You became the poster girl
of a politician.

2691
03:05:32,530 --> 03:05:34,600
You became the champion of
the feminists in this country.

2692
03:05:34,680 --> 03:05:37,700
But you are perfectly fine with
sexual assault at work place.

2693
03:05:40,030 --> 03:05:41,180
Frankly, Capt. Sharma.

2694
03:05:41,260 --> 03:05:44,070
Your feminism is really convenient.

2695
03:05:45,340 --> 03:05:47,470
In fact I would say you are
more of an opportunist...

2696
03:05:47,550 --> 03:05:48,950
...and not a feminist.

2697
03:05:51,350 --> 03:05:52,750
You're absolutely right, sir.

2698
03:05:53,660 --> 03:05:55,330
I am that type of girl.

2699
03:05:57,730 --> 03:06:00,490
I can do anything for
the corner office, sir.

2700
03:06:02,510 --> 03:06:05,870
What is sexual assault
in front of ambition?

2701
03:06:06,750 --> 03:06:08,600
I am here to make history, sir.

2702
03:06:09,610 --> 03:06:13,670
And to achieve something, we need
to make some sacrifices, sir.

2703
03:06:17,170 --> 03:06:18,640
This is what you wanted to hear,
right?

2704
03:06:20,740 --> 03:06:21,710
Now, may I leave.

2705
03:06:22,710 --> 03:06:25,650
Please understand.
I want to help you.

2706
03:06:26,300 --> 03:06:27,350
No, sir.

2707
03:06:27,660 --> 03:06:29,570
You want to save me, sir.

2708
03:06:30,770 --> 03:06:32,170
You want to be my hero.

2709
03:06:34,750 --> 03:06:36,140
But this is my story, sir.

2710
03:06:38,120 --> 03:06:39,920
And there is only
one hero in my story.

2711
03:06:41,740 --> 03:06:42,920
Myself.

2712
03:06:55,310 --> 03:06:56,940
Thirty six hours
had already passed.

2713
03:06:59,230 --> 03:07:02,970
No water, no food, no sleep.

2714
03:07:03,650 --> 03:07:05,630
The target was 500 metres
away from us.

2715
03:07:07,510 --> 03:07:09,770
And then suddenly
machine guns started firing.

2716
03:07:10,300 --> 03:07:11,600
We were taken by surprise.

2717
03:07:11,940 --> 03:07:16,720
[Gun shots]

2718
03:07:17,460 --> 03:07:19,040
Tej, Vishnu.
Right side.

2719
03:07:19,160 --> 03:07:20,570
Manit, Rohan.
Left side.

2720
03:07:20,920 --> 03:07:21,990
Bilal, with me.

2721
03:07:34,820 --> 03:07:36,720
Bilal.
Are you okay, Bilal?

2722
03:07:41,060 --> 03:07:42,150
Capt. Vishnu.

2723
03:07:43,890 --> 03:07:44,970
Bilal.

2724
03:07:46,530 --> 03:07:47,470
You okay?

2725
03:07:52,520 --> 03:07:53,510
Rohan, come in.

2726
03:07:56,160 --> 03:07:57,460
Manit, come in.
Manit.

2727
03:07:59,860 --> 03:08:02,510
Bilal, are you okay?
Bilal.

2728
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,990
I fell unconscious. And I
couldn't see anything after that.

2729
03:08:09,040 --> 03:08:10,410
Let's talk about the
things which happened...

2730
03:08:10,560 --> 03:08:11,730
...when you were in your senses.

2731
03:08:12,940 --> 03:08:14,410
You were Shikha's buddy.

2732
03:08:15,150 --> 03:08:16,990
How would you say were
your relations with Shikha?

2733
03:08:17,850 --> 03:08:19,530
Good, sir.
Very good.

2734
03:08:20,020 --> 03:08:20,750
Friendly.

2735
03:08:20,830 --> 03:08:23,950
No one was ready to befriend her
when she joined the course...

2736
03:08:25,050 --> 03:08:25,930
...except for me.

2737
03:08:27,940 --> 03:08:30,410
As the stress increased
during Dozakh

2738
03:08:31,030 --> 03:08:32,880
...it must have had an impact
on your friendship as well.

2739
03:08:34,980 --> 03:08:39,430
Sir, you know that disagreements
are common during such situations.

2740
03:08:39,510 --> 03:08:41,640
Be specific, Bilal. What was
the reason of the disagreement?

2741
03:08:42,330 --> 03:08:44,380
Shikha's navigation
led us the wrong way and...

2742
03:08:46,170 --> 03:08:47,130
That's why.

2743
03:08:48,880 --> 03:08:50,260
Tell me, Capt. Siddiqui.

2744
03:08:50,960 --> 03:08:53,420
Shikha was made the
team leader of Squad Alpha.

2745
03:08:53,800 --> 03:08:55,120
Were you completely
okay with that?

2746
03:08:56,760 --> 03:08:58,140
Yeah, initially I was.

2747
03:08:59,730 --> 03:09:02,130
Then when the mishap
of navigation happened...

2748
03:09:02,270 --> 03:09:04,960
...I felt Rohan is better
suited for the job.

2749
03:09:05,190 --> 03:09:07,870
It means, though
you were friends...

2750
03:09:07,950 --> 03:09:09,600
...you were not happy that Shikha
was made the team leader.

2751
03:09:10,060 --> 03:09:10,780
Why?

2752
03:09:10,860 --> 03:09:13,540
- Sir, I just said...
- Is it because she is a woman?

2753
03:09:13,770 --> 03:09:14,770
No.

2754
03:09:14,850 --> 03:09:15,930
No, sir.
Not at all.

2755
03:09:16,640 --> 03:09:19,080
I genuinely felt that Rohan
is better suited for the job.

2756
03:09:19,350 --> 03:09:20,950
It means that Shikha
is not a good leader.

2757
03:09:21,100 --> 03:09:22,540
Sir, I didn't say that.

2758
03:09:22,990 --> 03:09:24,430
Shikha is really good.

2759
03:09:24,570 --> 03:09:27,440
But there are a few people in
Squad Alpha who are more deserving.

2760
03:09:27,520 --> 03:09:28,410
Like who?

2761
03:09:29,240 --> 03:09:30,450
Like...

2762
03:09:30,670 --> 03:09:31,680
Like Manit.

2763
03:09:31,990 --> 03:09:33,840
Rohan or perhaps me.

2764
03:09:33,920 --> 03:09:36,070
It means everyone except Shikha.

2765
03:09:36,150 --> 03:09:37,450
Sir, I didn't say that.

2766
03:09:37,890 --> 03:09:39,590
Shikha is good.
In fact very good.

2767
03:09:39,670 --> 03:09:40,610
Very good for a woman.

2768
03:09:40,950 --> 03:09:41,980
This is what you mean to say,
right?

2769
03:09:42,300 --> 03:09:43,690
- No, sir.
- You know, Capt. Bilal...

2770
03:09:44,400 --> 03:09:46,830
Shikha was your friend.
First lady commando.

2771
03:09:47,130 --> 03:09:49,110
Exemplary in all
her courses so far...

2772
03:09:49,190 --> 03:09:51,310
...yet you couldn't
trust her 100 percent.

2773
03:09:51,390 --> 03:09:55,210
When Manit cut the blue wire
instead of red and lied...

2774
03:09:55,290 --> 03:09:57,420
...you supported him.
All of you supported him.

2775
03:09:58,400 --> 03:10:03,220
Just because you couldn't accept
a lady officer as a team leader.

2776
03:10:03,660 --> 03:10:05,410
- This is not true.
- Then you fell unconscious...

2777
03:10:05,490 --> 03:10:08,140
...but you and every member
of Squad Alpha...

2778
03:10:08,220 --> 03:10:09,970
...wrote exactly the same debriefs.

2779
03:10:10,410 --> 03:10:11,310
Word by word.

2780
03:10:12,680 --> 03:10:13,660
What is all this?

2781
03:10:14,420 --> 03:10:16,360
Some kind of a bro code
in your boys club.

2782
03:10:16,470 --> 03:10:18,020
Except that because of
this Capt. Sharma...

2783
03:10:18,100 --> 03:10:20,140
...whom you call your friend...

2784
03:10:20,220 --> 03:10:21,570
...got into trouble.

2785
03:10:21,880 --> 03:10:23,290
What type of friendship
is this, Capt. Bilal...

2786
03:10:23,420 --> 03:10:25,580
...that you didn't even have
the balls to look her in the eye...

2787
03:10:25,660 --> 03:10:27,330
...and say goodbye
to her as you left?

2788
03:10:28,780 --> 03:10:29,680
Fine.

2789
03:10:30,620 --> 03:10:32,450
You all are saying
that nothing happened.

2790
03:10:32,530 --> 03:10:34,590
So, I'll also write in my report
that nothing happened.

2791
03:10:35,820 --> 03:10:38,170
Shikha is nothing
but a manipulative liar.

2792
03:10:38,380 --> 03:10:39,790
And she shouldn't pass this course.

2793
03:10:39,870 --> 03:10:40,990
Sir, no matter how Shikha is...

2794
03:10:41,080 --> 03:10:42,330
...she is not manipulative.

2795
03:10:44,500 --> 03:10:46,590
You are trying to save your friend.

2796
03:10:50,120 --> 03:10:52,040
I wish I could protect her, sir.

2797
03:10:53,360 --> 03:10:54,360
I wish.

2798
03:10:55,420 --> 03:10:57,920
But trust me, sir.
Shikha is a strong girl.

2799
03:10:58,000 --> 03:10:59,290
She can protect herself.

2800
03:11:00,300 --> 03:11:01,840
I am not protecting her now.

2801
03:11:04,380 --> 03:11:05,760
Whom are you protecting then?

2802
03:11:07,400 --> 03:11:10,010
[Shikha] 'Bilal, are you okay?
Bilal.'

2803
03:11:15,610 --> 03:11:19,540
[Screams]

2804
03:11:21,480 --> 03:11:22,550
[Man2] 'Alpha1, come in.'

2805
03:11:29,230 --> 03:11:34,040
So, you won't tell me anything.
Fine.

2806
03:11:42,290 --> 03:11:45,570
Capt. Sharma, I don't
want to hurt you.

2807
03:11:46,080 --> 03:11:47,060
Let's keep it civil.

2808
03:11:47,760 --> 03:11:49,450
But I don't wish to do so.

2809
03:12:02,860 --> 03:12:03,870
What happened?

2810
03:12:04,360 --> 03:12:06,190
Being a Rajput, why
have you suddenly lost your valour?

2811
03:12:14,240 --> 03:12:15,490
Stealth and surprise.

2812
03:12:15,780 --> 03:12:17,590
First lesson of the special forces.

2813
03:12:18,490 --> 03:12:19,440
[Pained scream]

2814
03:12:26,700 --> 03:12:28,900
Come on, Rohan.
One more.

2815
03:12:30,300 --> 03:12:31,470
You know I can take it.

2816
03:12:42,770 --> 03:12:43,720
Stop!

2817
03:12:44,910 --> 03:12:46,010
Very good, Capt. Sharma.

2818
03:12:51,390 --> 03:12:52,150
Are you okay?

2819
03:12:52,230 --> 03:12:54,670
Are you fine, Capt. Rohan?
Are you okay?

2820
03:13:56,780 --> 03:13:58,310
I know what the truth is.

2821
03:13:59,050 --> 03:14:01,580
And I also know
that you know the truth.

2822
03:14:01,860 --> 03:14:02,990
Sir, it's not what you think.

2823
03:14:03,070 --> 03:14:04,320
It's exactly what I think.

2824
03:14:04,420 --> 03:14:07,020
- No, sir.. It's...
- It is exactly what I think.

2825
03:14:08,230 --> 03:14:11,020
I just met your dearest
friend, Capt. Bilal.

2826
03:14:12,070 --> 03:14:14,230
- Sir, he is an overemotional...
- Relax, Capt. Rathore.

2827
03:14:15,290 --> 03:14:16,630
Capt. Bilal didn't say anything.

2828
03:14:18,360 --> 03:14:21,000
What are you doing here
if Capt. Bilal didn't say anything?

2829
03:14:22,800 --> 03:14:23,720
You invited me here.

2830
03:14:23,800 --> 03:14:25,730
And now you are asking me
what I am doing here!

2831
03:14:26,840 --> 03:14:29,830
I know that you had sent that
anonymous mail, Capt. Rathore.

2832
03:14:31,690 --> 03:14:35,300
Right cyber cafe, right time,
right mail, right recipient...

2833
03:14:36,580 --> 03:14:38,070
But you made one mistake.

2834
03:14:41,110 --> 03:14:42,350
He was wearing a muffler.

2835
03:14:42,450 --> 03:14:44,130
- Just...
- Muffler?

2836
03:14:44,380 --> 03:14:46,800
Yes, sir. It was this colour.
Red colour.

2837
03:14:48,720 --> 03:14:51,500
Your daughter must have gifted
this bright pink muffler to you.

2838
03:14:52,580 --> 03:14:53,620
Am I right?

2839
03:14:55,620 --> 03:14:56,680
Frankly, Capt. Rathore...

2840
03:14:56,760 --> 03:14:59,510
...till 2 hours ago, you were
accused number 1 for me.

2841
03:15:00,040 --> 03:15:02,650
But your Krav Maga
exercise saved you.

2842
03:15:04,010 --> 03:15:05,540
[Imtiyaz] 'Shikha's injuries
are on the left side.'

2843
03:15:06,130 --> 03:15:07,160
[Imtiyaz] 'But you are a leftie.'

2844
03:15:07,640 --> 03:15:10,630
A right-handed person
has assaulted Shikha.

2845
03:15:12,010 --> 03:15:13,810
I think it's time now,
Capt. Rathore...

2846
03:15:14,470 --> 03:15:17,890
...that you tell me
what happened that day.

2847
03:15:26,650 --> 03:15:27,930
36 hours.

2848
03:15:29,570 --> 03:15:31,450
Keep walking.
[Siren.]

2849
03:15:31,650 --> 03:15:33,280
[Rohan] 'Without food or sleep.'

2850
03:15:34,720 --> 03:15:36,170
- Red.
- Blue. - Red.

2851
03:15:36,550 --> 03:15:38,240
[Rohan] 'Moreover,
we were given sleeping pills.'

2852
03:15:39,080 --> 03:15:40,660
[Rohan] 'Some people were
having hallucinations and...'

2853
03:15:40,750 --> 03:15:42,010
[Rohan] 'Some just
couldn't take it.'

2854
03:15:42,100 --> 03:15:46,900
[Gunshots]

2855
03:15:49,110 --> 03:15:50,340
[Pained scream]

2856
03:15:55,560 --> 03:15:57,210
- Alpha 1, come in.
- Rohan.

2857
03:15:57,500 --> 03:15:59,360
Rohan, where are the targets
coming from?

2858
03:15:59,550 --> 03:16:00,690
They are moving targets.

2859
03:16:00,770 --> 03:16:02,350
I guess, we've been surrounded.

2860
03:16:03,160 --> 03:16:04,170
Bilal, are you okay?

2861
03:16:05,060 --> 03:16:06,160
Bilal.

2862
03:16:06,770 --> 03:16:08,440
Bro, shall we move ahead?

2863
03:16:09,180 --> 03:16:10,650
We are losing precious time, man.

2864
03:16:15,140 --> 03:16:17,220
Bilal...

2865
03:16:17,350 --> 03:16:18,380
Capt. Sharma.

2866
03:16:19,010 --> 03:16:21,480
Bilal is a tough cookie.
He will survive this.

2867
03:16:21,610 --> 03:16:24,570
But if we stay here, we'll
never reach the end point.

2868
03:16:24,650 --> 03:16:26,590
Capt. Rohan, take the
defensive position.

2869
03:16:26,730 --> 03:16:28,770
We can't leave Bilal behind.

2870
03:16:28,840 --> 03:16:30,960
Would you say the same
if this was a real war?

2871
03:16:31,510 --> 03:16:33,300
You can win the war
with logic, Capt. Sharma...

2872
03:16:33,390 --> 03:16:34,470
...and not with emotions.

2873
03:16:34,670 --> 03:16:36,340
Capt. Manit, would you
have said the same thing...

2874
03:16:36,420 --> 03:16:37,720
...if you were in Bilal's place?

2875
03:16:38,770 --> 03:16:40,630
Rohan, do as I say?
Take the defensive position.

2876
03:16:45,280 --> 03:16:46,550
[Gunshots]

2877
03:16:46,630 --> 03:16:47,820
[Screams]

2878
03:16:50,970 --> 03:16:53,140
Bilal...
Bilal, you okay?

2879
03:16:53,310 --> 03:16:54,630
Bilal, are you hit?
Bilal.

2880
03:16:56,090 --> 03:16:58,830
Tej Bahadur, is Vishnu all right?

2881
03:16:58,930 --> 03:17:00,080
No, sir.

2882
03:17:01,540 --> 03:17:04,070
Tej, is there firing in the
direction that we just came in?

2883
03:17:05,570 --> 03:17:07,420
No, sir.
This way is clear.

2884
03:17:08,070 --> 03:17:10,280
Tej, you'll move back
along with Vishnu.

2885
03:17:10,560 --> 03:17:12,680
- We will give you cover. Copy?
- Yes, sir.

2886
03:17:12,740 --> 03:17:13,880
[Gunshots]

2887
03:17:14,750 --> 03:17:15,830
Vishnu.

2888
03:17:21,570 --> 03:17:22,280
Come on.

2889
03:17:24,290 --> 03:17:26,360
Capt. Sharma, are you
suggesting us to retreat?

2890
03:17:26,640 --> 03:17:28,150
If you and Rohan give me cover...

2891
03:17:28,240 --> 03:17:30,620
...Tej and I will go in the middle
and establish the perimeter.

2892
03:17:30,800 --> 03:17:32,440
We need these points, Capt. Sharma.

2893
03:17:32,520 --> 03:17:34,260
We have to finish
this exercise, damn it.

2894
03:17:34,360 --> 03:17:35,650
I will not risk the
lives of my men...

2895
03:17:35,730 --> 03:17:37,040
...to complete this exercise,
Manit.

2896
03:17:38,340 --> 03:17:39,870
[Gunshots]

2897
03:17:43,140 --> 03:17:44,590
You are a f*****g coward.

2898
03:17:46,870 --> 03:17:48,910
S***a, you are putting up
a drama saying...

2899
03:17:48,990 --> 03:17:50,440
..."I'll not risk
the lives of my men"...

2900
03:17:50,520 --> 03:17:51,660
in order to hide your cowardice.

2901
03:17:53,500 --> 03:17:55,350
Rats are the ones
who hide, Capt. Sharma.

2902
03:17:55,970 --> 03:17:56,850
Men don't hide.

2903
03:17:57,730 --> 03:17:59,590
Men fight in war and
that too, only to win.

2904
03:17:59,650 --> 03:18:00,790
Hey, Amitabh Bachchan.

2905
03:18:01,560 --> 03:18:03,100
We will win the war
only if we stay alive.

2906
03:18:03,630 --> 03:18:05,960
This is not a simulation exercise.
These bullets are real.

2907
03:18:06,580 --> 03:18:08,290
We just have one way
and that is to move back.

2908
03:18:08,630 --> 03:18:09,780
We have to retreat.

2909
03:18:10,520 --> 03:18:12,970
What do we do? Do you
want us to behave like girls?

2910
03:18:14,510 --> 03:18:15,800
How dare you, Manit!

2911
03:18:17,200 --> 03:18:19,180
Do you have any doubt about
who is in command here?

2912
03:18:20,870 --> 03:18:23,540
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.

2913
03:18:27,990 --> 03:18:30,570
1950 Army Act, Section 46.

2914
03:18:30,870 --> 03:18:33,820
Misconduct, desertion,
disobedience, use of force.

2915
03:18:34,610 --> 03:18:36,850
You can get
court-martialled for this.

2916
03:18:38,320 --> 03:18:41,490
I won't put my squad at risk...

2917
03:18:41,570 --> 03:18:43,780
...because of your machismo
and ego trip, Manit.

2918
03:18:44,790 --> 03:18:48,040
And if I'll have to shoot you
in order to save my squad...

2919
03:18:48,750 --> 03:18:50,410
...I will fire.

2920
03:18:52,530 --> 03:18:55,100
We have to retreat.
And that is final.

2921
03:18:56,370 --> 03:18:57,700
Did you understand?

2922
03:19:01,330 --> 03:19:02,690
[Screams]

2923
03:19:04,860 --> 03:19:06,650
What the f**k are you doing,
Manit?

2924
03:19:06,760 --> 03:19:09,670
[Screams]

2925
03:19:15,440 --> 03:19:18,970
Sir, that was the moment
which I'll regret my entire life.

2926
03:19:21,160 --> 03:19:23,390
Because I was the only one
who could have intervened.

2927
03:19:24,490 --> 03:19:27,070
But I didn't.
I chose the wrong side.

2928
03:19:28,090 --> 03:19:29,190
But believe me, sir.

2929
03:19:29,300 --> 03:19:31,510
I had no idea what
would happen next.

2930
03:19:31,850 --> 03:19:36,650
[Screams]

2931
03:19:47,780 --> 03:19:49,300
You f*****g b***h!

2932
03:19:51,810 --> 03:19:52,910
Are you done now, s***i?

2933
03:19:52,970 --> 03:19:55,400
Now you see, I'll put
you back in your place.

2934
03:20:01,830 --> 03:20:04,260
Manit, what are you doing?

2935
03:20:06,820 --> 03:20:07,850
Manit!

2936
03:20:08,740 --> 03:20:09,830
Manit!

2937
03:20:10,220 --> 03:20:11,410
Manit!

2938
03:20:11,490 --> 03:20:13,060
[Cough and gasping]

2939
03:20:15,100 --> 03:20:18,510
[Unbuckle belt]

2940
03:20:19,510 --> 03:20:20,770
[Manit]

2941
03:20:23,680 --> 03:20:26,070
Stop it.
Manit!

2942
03:20:33,150 --> 03:20:36,250
- Manit!
- Shut up!

2943
03:20:39,390 --> 03:20:42,220
[Cries]

2944
03:21:01,040 --> 03:21:05,830
[Cries]

2945
03:21:07,600 --> 03:21:08,790
[Pained scream]

2946
03:21:19,460 --> 03:21:20,810
Manit.
B*******d.

2947
03:21:21,710 --> 03:21:23,230
You f*****g b*****d.

2948
03:21:23,550 --> 03:21:25,120
Shikha.
Capt. Sharma.

2949
03:21:25,470 --> 03:21:26,530
Capt. Sharma, are you okay?

2950
03:21:26,940 --> 03:21:28,220
[Gunshots]

2951
03:21:29,020 --> 03:21:30,520
Sharma.

2952
03:21:42,110 --> 03:21:43,160
Capt. Sharma.

2953
03:21:45,830 --> 03:21:47,600
F*****g a*****e.
What were you doing?

2954
03:21:48,130 --> 03:21:50,220
Shikha, everything is fine.
Shikha, you are fine.

2955
03:21:50,330 --> 03:21:52,250
Shikha, look at me.
Shikha, you are fine.

2956
03:21:52,330 --> 03:21:53,340
Rohan...

2957
03:21:53,510 --> 03:21:54,810
[Buttstroke]

2958
03:21:56,010 --> 03:21:57,750
Manit, s***e.
B*******d.

2959
03:21:58,220 --> 03:21:59,610
What the hell are you doing?

2960
03:21:59,690 --> 03:22:02,140
Rohan.
Rohan, try to understand.

2961
03:22:02,370 --> 03:22:03,520
If she were conscious...

2962
03:22:03,610 --> 03:22:05,550
...we both would have been
charged with disobedience.

2963
03:22:05,690 --> 03:22:07,130
And we would've never become SFs.

2964
03:22:07,600 --> 03:22:08,750
[Coughs]

2965
03:22:09,630 --> 03:22:11,380
Now, it will be her
words against ours.

2966
03:22:12,060 --> 03:22:13,150
And no witness.

2967
03:22:14,520 --> 03:22:16,100
[Coughs]

2968
03:22:17,390 --> 03:22:19,520
We have given our blood and
sweat to reach this place.

2969
03:22:19,720 --> 03:22:21,120
We cannot let this go.

2970
03:22:23,200 --> 03:22:25,050
[Coughs]

2971
03:22:28,720 --> 03:22:32,450
After that the firing stopped
but we had lost radio contact.

2972
03:22:35,730 --> 03:22:39,330
Maybe even Mr. Bhatti had found
out that there is something wrong.

2973
03:22:52,190 --> 03:22:53,320
She slipped.

2974
03:22:55,230 --> 03:22:56,360
She hit her head.

2975
03:23:27,670 --> 03:23:29,430
Capt. Rathore, I'm not
able to understand...

2976
03:23:29,510 --> 03:23:33,240
...why you didn't lodge an official
complaint with Colonel Sathe.

2977
03:23:34,440 --> 03:23:35,870
Because it wasn't so simple, sir.

2978
03:23:37,660 --> 03:23:40,260
Bilal saw me with Shikha
and not Manit.

2979
03:23:41,120 --> 03:23:42,780
Manit would have blamed me and...

2980
03:23:43,490 --> 03:23:45,330
It would have been just
his word against mine.

2981
03:23:46,540 --> 03:23:47,900
And I thought Shikha would come...

2982
03:23:47,980 --> 03:23:49,740
...and complain against
Manit to Colonel Sathe.

2983
03:23:50,180 --> 03:23:51,450
But she didn't say anything, sir.

2984
03:23:52,890 --> 03:23:55,730
When did you think about
writing this anonymous mail?

2985
03:23:57,910 --> 03:23:59,960
You are not troubling mom, right?

2986
03:24:00,120 --> 03:24:00,910
-[Arshi] No.
-[Rohan] 'I spoke to my daughter'

2987
03:24:00,990 --> 03:24:02,200
[Rohan] 'in the evening.'
Good girl.

2988
03:24:02,690 --> 03:24:06,750
'Dad, I want to wear
the army uniform just like you.'

2989
03:24:14,660 --> 03:24:16,650
Then I went to the military
hospital to meet Shikha.

2990
03:24:17,810 --> 03:24:19,390
I couldn't see
the state she was in.

2991
03:24:21,070 --> 03:24:22,360
I couldn't hold it, sir.

2992
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:24,220
I had to do something.

2993
03:24:28,590 --> 03:24:31,520
I couldn't see injustice
being done to Shikha, sir.

2994
03:24:32,520 --> 03:24:34,160
Sir, she is also a fellow officer.

2995
03:24:35,860 --> 03:24:37,120
She is also my course mate.

2996
03:24:39,110 --> 03:24:42,260
Bilal was Shikha's
as well as my friend.

2997
03:24:43,470 --> 03:24:45,810
Yet he chose me.
He remain quiet.

2998
03:24:54,930 --> 03:24:59,730
[Footsteps]

2999
03:25:27,600 --> 03:25:28,620
So, officers.

3000
03:25:28,970 --> 03:25:31,410
It's time for the two last
exercises of the course.

3001
03:25:32,130 --> 03:25:33,470
Which means the last opportunity...

3002
03:25:33,540 --> 03:25:36,250
...to increase your rankings
on the leadership board.

3003
03:25:36,970 --> 03:25:38,020
So far the rankings are...

3004
03:25:38,100 --> 03:25:39,710
...Capt. Surjewala at number 5.

3005
03:25:39,790 --> 03:25:41,160
Capt. Tank at number 4.

3006
03:25:41,240 --> 03:25:42,530
Capt. Rohan, number 3.

3007
03:25:42,650 --> 03:25:44,030
Capt. Shikha at number 2.

3008
03:25:44,660 --> 03:25:46,870
And Capt. Manit is at number 1.

3009
03:25:50,010 --> 03:25:51,500
10 shots in 90 seconds.

3010
03:25:51,880 --> 03:25:54,880
Five shots from assault rifle
and five shots from pistol.

3011
03:25:55,050 --> 03:25:56,680
The target will be moving
in the last shot.

3012
03:25:58,270 --> 03:25:59,660
Two fans will be placed
on both the sides.

3013
03:26:00,490 --> 03:26:02,360
The speed of air will
be 10 miles per hour.

3014
03:26:03,500 --> 03:26:06,610
- Capt. Surjewala, will you start?
- Sure, sir.

3015
03:26:07,430 --> 03:26:08,850
[Beep sound]

3016
03:26:10,180 --> 03:26:11,180
[Whistle]

3017
03:26:13,820 --> 03:26:15,880

3018
03:26:38,680 --> 03:26:39,840

03:26:41,560 --> 03:26:44,760

3020
03:26:45,360 --> 03:26:46,390
[Beep sound]

3021
03:26:49,910 --> 03:26:53,520
Sir, can I go at the end
if you permit?

3022
03:26:53,800 --> 03:26:54,820
Why, Capt. Sharma?

3023
03:26:55,000 --> 03:26:57,110
Is it a new technique
to be number one?

3024
03:26:59,860 --> 03:27:00,870
Permission.

3025
03:27:03,140 --> 03:27:05,870
[Gunshots]

3026
03:27:06,540 --> 03:27:07,810

3034
03:28:00,080 --> 03:28:03,840
[Gunshots]

3035
03:28:17,090 --> 03:28:17,980
[Gunshot]

3036
03:28:32,830 --> 03:28:34,070
Hello, Capt. Shikha.

3037
03:28:34,940 --> 03:28:37,040
Your wrist must be hurting
after Krav Maga bout.

3038
03:28:37,710 --> 03:28:39,200
That's why you
missed the shot as well.

3039
03:28:39,930 --> 03:28:41,690
It's okay.
Happens.

3040
03:28:43,090 --> 03:28:45,480
Actually, Manit, you are
a cross country runner.

3041
03:28:45,690 --> 03:28:46,810
You think one step at a time.

3042
03:28:47,430 --> 03:28:48,810
I think about future.

3043
03:28:50,780 --> 03:28:52,640
It's too deep.
You won't understand.

3044
03:28:58,300 --> 03:28:59,300
[Manit] 'Yes, sir.'

3045
03:28:59,750 --> 03:29:00,840
Yes, sir.
I know, sir.

3046
03:29:01,230 --> 03:29:02,430
Thank you very much, sir.

3047
03:29:02,510 --> 03:29:03,560
I really appreciate it.

3048
03:29:03,710 --> 03:29:04,730
Thank you.

3049
03:29:04,920 --> 03:29:06,050
What happened, dude?

3050
03:29:06,730 --> 03:29:09,070
You seem really happy.

3051
03:29:09,850 --> 03:29:11,780
Do you remember about my brawl
I had during my YO's course?

3052
03:29:11,870 --> 03:29:14,780
Yes, you told me. It's was
your ex-girlfriend's issue.

3053
03:29:16,020 --> 03:29:18,450
That got solved.
How?

3054
03:29:19,020 --> 03:29:22,850
- It was a false complaint.
- You're tactical, s**le.

3055
03:29:22,940 --> 03:29:24,520
That is why I'm at number one
on the leader board.

3056
03:29:24,830 --> 03:29:25,970
Number one.

3057
03:29:26,140 --> 03:29:27,260
Good.

3058
03:29:29,230 --> 03:29:34,010
[Gunshots]

3059
03:29:39,890 --> 03:29:41,260
[Imtiyaz] 'Close shot
there, Capt. Sharma.'

3060
03:29:42,820 --> 03:29:43,910
What do you mean, sir?

3061
03:29:44,650 --> 03:29:46,890
I mean to say, you were right.

3062
03:29:48,250 --> 03:29:49,370
About what, sir?

3063
03:29:49,590 --> 03:29:51,650
That you don't need me.

3064
03:29:51,840 --> 03:29:53,990
You are the hero of your story.

3065
03:29:55,400 --> 03:29:58,350
I know you missed
the last shot deliberately.

3066
03:29:59,070 --> 03:30:00,550
During the final exercise...

3067
03:30:00,680 --> 03:30:03,520
...rank one and rank three
will be paired. You knew it.

3068
03:30:04,170 --> 03:30:06,300
That's why you went to
number three from number two.

3069
03:30:07,430 --> 03:30:08,620
Why would I do that, sir?

3070
03:30:08,700 --> 03:30:10,910
In order to end
what Manit had started.

3071
03:30:13,810 --> 03:30:15,010
I know the truth.

3072
03:30:22,500 --> 03:30:24,870
Sir, my truth is that...

3073
03:30:26,420 --> 03:30:27,970
...I am in the special forces...

3074
03:30:28,060 --> 03:30:30,590
...because I deserve
to be in the special forces, sir.

3075
03:30:32,250 --> 03:30:34,890
Not because of my gender
or in spite of being a girl.

3076
03:30:37,340 --> 03:30:38,520
I am a soldier's daughter, sir.

3077
03:30:38,720 --> 03:30:39,880
I am an athlete.

3078
03:30:39,940 --> 03:30:41,040
A shooting champion.

3079
03:30:41,200 --> 03:30:42,840
Since childhood,
I always had one dream...

3080
03:30:42,920 --> 03:30:45,780
...that I would wear this uniform
after I grow up.

3081
03:30:47,700 --> 03:30:51,270
And no feudal...

3082
03:30:51,970 --> 03:30:53,300
...misogynistic...

3083
03:30:54,660 --> 03:30:57,030
...criminal, unofficer like man...

3084
03:30:58,280 --> 03:31:00,520
...can neither snatch away
this dream of mine, sir...

3085
03:31:00,600 --> 03:31:02,320
...nor my sense of justice.

3086
03:31:02,960 --> 03:31:04,090
Let's get the past done.

3087
03:31:04,170 --> 03:31:05,700
Sir, I had already told you...

3088
03:31:07,240 --> 03:31:08,320
...I am enough for myself.

3089
03:31:11,240 --> 03:31:12,310
Shikha.

3090
03:31:16,050 --> 03:31:18,560
Think about others
and not just yourself.

3091
03:31:21,410 --> 03:31:23,410
Other lady officers
will come after you.

3092
03:31:23,490 --> 03:31:25,190
We must set an example for them.

3093
03:31:25,700 --> 03:31:27,360
- And defence minister...
- Defence minister...

3094
03:31:27,440 --> 03:31:28,960
...whose poster girl I am, sir.

3095
03:31:30,700 --> 03:31:32,110
I maybe her poster girl...

3096
03:31:32,590 --> 03:31:35,940
...but I am not her or any
politician's puppet, sir.

3097
03:31:38,010 --> 03:31:39,440
As for all the lady officers...

3098
03:31:39,520 --> 03:31:42,800
...then I am trying to set
an example for them, sir.

3099
03:31:43,720 --> 03:31:44,550
Till now...

3100
03:31:44,650 --> 03:31:47,680
...why weren't girls inducted
into the Indian Special Forces?

3101
03:31:48,980 --> 03:31:51,730
The authorities have their
reasons and they are valid.

3102
03:31:53,150 --> 03:31:56,870
This is my only opportunity
to prove them wrong.

3103
03:31:58,350 --> 03:32:00,410
I deserve to die
for this country...

3104
03:32:00,500 --> 03:32:02,460
...as much as any man.

3105
03:32:03,600 --> 03:32:05,800
The lady officers will
come here in future...

3106
03:32:05,880 --> 03:32:08,340
...because we will earn
our right to be here.

3107
03:32:10,670 --> 03:32:12,750
If I fail in this test now, sir...

3108
03:32:14,610 --> 03:32:16,030
...the door of active
combat will be closed...

3109
03:32:16,190 --> 03:32:19,240
...for thousands of girls.

3110
03:32:19,310 --> 03:32:20,710
And you won't let that happen.

3111
03:32:22,500 --> 03:32:24,500
I'm happy that you are looking
at the larger picture.

3112
03:32:25,130 --> 03:32:26,680
In fact, I respect you for that.

3113
03:32:27,690 --> 03:32:30,560
But still we must name and
shame the b*****d, Shikha.

3114
03:32:32,650 --> 03:32:33,730
I...

3115
03:32:34,640 --> 03:32:35,740
Not we, sir.

3116
03:32:41,690 --> 03:32:43,690
In my 26 years of career...

3117
03:32:44,680 --> 03:32:46,490
...I turned out to be
wrong for the first time.

3118
03:32:47,810 --> 03:32:50,590
Imtiyaz, give me
that officer's name.

3119
03:32:51,480 --> 03:32:53,210
He does not deserve
the maroon beret.

3120
03:32:56,950 --> 03:32:58,950
Sometimes to figure out
the opponent's game...

3121
03:32:59,560 --> 03:33:01,140
...we have to call all
the bets on the table.

3122
03:33:06,640 --> 03:33:08,600
But these are rankings
for tomorrow's exercise.

3123
03:33:09,170 --> 03:33:10,270
Yes.

3124
03:33:10,860 --> 03:33:12,820
Shikha has come to number
three from number two.

3125
03:33:12,980 --> 03:33:16,360
Which means her buddy has
been changed in the final exercise.

3126
03:33:21,380 --> 03:33:22,800
God d**m it.

3127
03:33:24,270 --> 03:33:25,480
Capt. Manit!

3128
03:33:27,600 --> 03:33:29,610
I'm going to roger that fellow.

3129
03:33:29,680 --> 03:33:30,850
But not now, sir.

3130
03:33:31,940 --> 03:33:32,750
What do you mean?

3131
03:33:34,830 --> 03:33:38,700
It's my honour, my self-respect.

3132
03:33:39,820 --> 03:33:41,550
In order to protect this...

3133
03:33:42,350 --> 03:33:45,330
...I don't need
the help of any man.

3134
03:33:48,840 --> 03:33:50,890
- But, Shikha...
- I won't complain, sir.

3135
03:33:52,440 --> 03:33:53,950
He will confess.

3136
03:33:55,130 --> 03:33:56,320
But, Shikha, still...

3137
03:33:56,400 --> 03:33:57,830
Please give me 24 hours.

3138
03:33:58,790 --> 03:34:02,230
Just 24 hours.
Please.

3139
03:34:04,200 --> 03:34:05,800
[Sathe] 'This is absurd, Imtiyaz.'

3140
03:34:06,010 --> 03:34:07,970
Manit needs to be
thrown out right away.

3141
03:34:08,150 --> 03:34:10,340
But sir, you won't be able to
do this without my report.

3142
03:34:11,530 --> 03:34:15,300
Don't teach me what
I can and can't do.

3143
03:34:22,740 --> 03:34:24,200
Just 24 hours, sir.

3144
03:34:25,290 --> 03:34:28,120
Shikha has asked me and I
am asking you. Please, sir.

3145
03:34:29,310 --> 03:34:31,820
You'll get Manit's confession
in these 24 hours.

3146
03:34:35,150 --> 03:34:36,890
Lieutenant colonel
Imtiyaz Hussain...

3147
03:34:38,200 --> 03:34:42,760
...if Manit commits another act
of injustice in these 24 hours...

3148
03:34:43,950 --> 03:34:46,120
...will you take the
responsibility for it?

3149
03:34:47,130 --> 03:34:49,690
I'm turning the situation
on its head.

3150
03:34:51,030 --> 03:34:55,330
What will we do if Shikha
takes a severe step?

3151
03:34:56,250 --> 03:34:59,190
Sir, Shikha came so far
just because of her ability.

3152
03:34:59,720 --> 03:35:01,990
You had no hopes
from her on day one.

3153
03:35:02,150 --> 03:35:03,290
But today...

3154
03:35:03,420 --> 03:35:06,160
Just give her one chance
on this last day.

3155
03:35:06,770 --> 03:35:10,040
Then you will get both the
complaint and the confession.

3156
03:35:10,120 --> 03:35:11,840
And that's my promise to you, sir.

3157
03:35:14,330 --> 03:35:15,630
Now, she isn't the test case, sir.

3158
03:35:16,290 --> 03:35:18,140
In fact, she is the best case.

3159
03:35:18,760 --> 03:35:20,960
Don't think as a commandant.
Think like a soldier, sir.

3160
03:35:21,850 --> 03:35:25,040
And Shikha is a soldier
who deserves her justice.

3161
03:35:36,120 --> 03:35:37,950
[Phone ringing]

3162
03:35:38,400 --> 03:35:40,230
- Yes, Mom.
- It's the last chance

3163
03:35:40,520 --> 03:35:41,740
and you have to come first.

3164
03:35:41,830 --> 03:35:43,490
- Or else...
- You'll break my legs, right?

3165
03:35:44,180 --> 03:35:45,310
[Shikha] 'I know that, Mom.'

3166
03:35:45,750 --> 03:35:46,740
I don't know about coming first.

3167
03:35:46,820 --> 03:35:49,000
But I will finish what I started.

3168
03:35:50,220 --> 03:35:51,530
[Shikha] 'Dad must
have gone somewhere.'

3169
03:35:54,690 --> 03:35:55,800
Yes, dear.

3170
03:35:56,600 --> 03:35:59,630
- Forget it.
- Dear, we all are with you.

3171
03:36:00,150 --> 03:36:01,160
Just wait and watch...

3172
03:36:01,350 --> 03:36:03,300
...you will be the number one.

3173
03:36:04,410 --> 03:36:06,490
I'll call you after the exercise,
Mom. Okay?

3174
03:36:07,720 --> 03:36:09,000
Take care of yourself.

3175
03:36:09,680 --> 03:36:10,600
Bye, Mom.

3176
03:36:30,220 --> 03:36:32,140
[Door knocking]

3177
03:36:37,890 --> 03:36:39,110
[Gunshot]

3178
03:36:49,380 --> 03:36:50,990
Going beyond enemy lines...

3179
03:36:51,190 --> 03:36:55,390
...is a part and parcel of every
special officer's life.

3180
03:36:56,650 --> 03:36:57,760
But...

3181
03:36:58,520 --> 03:37:03,410
...our work is not just to cross
the border and kill our enemies.

3182
03:37:04,300 --> 03:37:07,840
Many times, we need
to rescue the hostages.

3183
03:37:08,210 --> 03:37:10,730
Be it civilians,
political prisoners...

3184
03:37:10,820 --> 03:37:13,170
...or our own soldiers.

3185
03:37:13,760 --> 03:37:17,660
Your last exercise is
hostage rescue operation.

3186
03:37:18,960 --> 03:37:20,290
Lieutenant Colonel Imtiyaz.

3187
03:37:22,470 --> 03:37:25,730
Officers, you will perform
this task in pairs of two.

3188
03:37:25,840 --> 03:37:28,840
You need to cross the border
and enter the enemy area.

3189
03:37:28,920 --> 03:37:32,620
And without using any ammunition,
you have to rescue the hostages.

3190
03:37:32,850 --> 03:37:34,390
And in the heat of the moment...

3191
03:37:34,470 --> 03:37:36,250
...if you use ammunition...

3192
03:37:36,330 --> 03:37:37,850
...you will be disqualified.

3193
03:37:39,300 --> 03:37:40,430
Dummy hostage...

3194
03:37:40,710 --> 03:37:43,650
...can be anywhere among
these five locations.

3195
03:37:44,760 --> 03:37:48,600
And if the enemy traces you in
the process or if you get caught...

3196
03:37:49,750 --> 03:37:51,610
...you will be out
of this exercise.

3197
03:37:52,440 --> 03:37:53,970
And if you are able to cross
the border...

3198
03:37:54,110 --> 03:37:55,740
...you will regroup at Point Alpha.

3199
03:37:56,090 --> 03:37:57,980
In order to complete this task...

3200
03:37:58,120 --> 03:38:00,820
...very buddy pair
will have just two hours' time.

3201
03:38:02,930 --> 03:38:03,950
Remember one thing.

3202
03:38:04,870 --> 03:38:06,320
Your real weapon...

3203
03:38:07,160 --> 03:38:08,780
...is your sharp mind and body.

3204
03:38:10,530 --> 03:38:11,620
So, get ready.

3205
03:38:16,220 --> 03:38:17,850
Just don't slow me down,
Capt. Sharma.

3206
03:38:19,160 --> 03:38:20,610
Want to finish with the flourish.

3207
03:38:21,390 --> 03:38:23,380
Don't worry, Capt. Manit.
You will finish...

3208
03:38:23,610 --> 03:38:24,610
...with a flourish.

3209
03:38:26,320 --> 03:38:27,410
[Bhatti] 'Attention.'

3210
03:38:28,020 --> 03:38:29,180
Are you people ready?

3211
03:38:29,210 --> 03:38:30,890
Yes, sir...
- [Whistle]

3212
03:38:31,240 --> 03:38:33,990
[Boots thumping]

3213

[Huffing]

3228
03:42:13,290 --> 03:42:15,990
I specifically told you not
to slow me down, Capt. Sharma.

3229
03:42:21,160 --> 03:42:22,250
Slow you down!

3230
03:42:23,510 --> 03:42:24,930
You are here because of me.

3231
03:42:26,880 --> 03:42:28,290
Who saved your life a while ago?

3232
03:42:30,050 --> 03:42:31,430
S***a coward.

3233
03:42:31,500 --> 03:42:33,450
You no more address me
with respect.

3234
03:42:35,510 --> 03:42:36,580
Really?

3235
03:42:38,500 --> 03:42:41,860
Will you declare to the whole world
that you saved my life?

3236
03:42:43,350 --> 03:42:46,360
And you didn't save my life.
I was handling myself.

3237
03:42:47,510 --> 03:42:49,500
I was not asking for help,
like you girls.

3238
03:42:51,610 --> 03:42:54,530
Girls will only ask for help
when guys like you are with them.

3239
03:42:55,660 --> 03:42:56,940
What the f**k!

3240
03:42:57,410 --> 03:42:59,910
Unfortunately, this is army
and not a kitty party.

3241
03:43:00,130 --> 03:43:01,730
There are no points
for bitching here.

3242
03:43:07,100 --> 03:43:08,310
You know, this...

3243
03:43:09,350 --> 03:43:12,210
This is exactly why girls
shouldn't be inducted into SF.

3244
03:43:13,030 --> 03:43:14,750
It's fine to be doctors and nurses.

3245
03:43:15,720 --> 03:43:18,510
But active combat
is not your cup of tea.

3246
03:43:19,600 --> 03:43:22,080
You come here professing
your love for the country.

3247
03:43:22,570 --> 03:43:23,970
When you go through hell here...

3248
03:43:24,850 --> 03:43:27,080
...you people want cushy postings.

3249
03:43:27,670 --> 03:43:28,570
What else?

3250
03:43:28,650 --> 03:43:30,680
Marriage in four years
and then pregnancy.

3251
03:43:31,370 --> 03:43:34,110
Then a same-station posting
with your husband.

3252
03:43:36,470 --> 03:43:38,040
You take care of kids.

3253
03:43:39,240 --> 03:43:40,550
While we will handle the guns.

3254
03:43:40,960 --> 03:43:42,060
Seriously.

3255
03:43:42,140 --> 03:43:44,130
You are a girl. So, be like one.

3256
03:43:45,520 --> 03:43:46,770
Don't try to be a man.

3257
03:43:47,780 --> 03:43:49,000
Just do what you are best at.

3258
03:43:52,830 --> 03:43:53,910
Which is what?

3259
03:43:54,970 --> 03:43:56,590
To turn guys like you into men?

3260
03:43:57,270 --> 03:43:58,860
What do you mean by that?

3261
03:43:58,930 --> 03:44:01,880
You are a guy but not a man.

3262
03:44:03,790 --> 03:44:05,100
Did you forget my manliness?

3263
03:44:05,620 --> 03:44:07,540
What is the use of
you being an officer?

3264
03:44:08,410 --> 03:44:09,640
You are neither smart...

3265
03:44:09,880 --> 03:44:11,010
...nor are you deserving.

3266
03:44:11,780 --> 03:44:13,140
You act like an animal.

3267
03:44:13,220 --> 03:44:15,040
Where do you get
this arrogance from?

3268
03:44:15,910 --> 03:44:16,940
Tell me.

3269
03:44:17,780 --> 03:44:19,280
Just because
you were born with a d**k.

3270
03:44:21,730 --> 03:44:23,320
Isn't that why you didn't complain?

3271
03:44:25,130 --> 03:44:26,330
Why didn't you complain?

3272
03:44:27,590 --> 03:44:29,330
Were you scared or ashamed...

3273
03:44:29,710 --> 03:44:30,920
...that everyone will get to know?

3274
03:44:31,840 --> 03:44:33,110
What will people say?

3275
03:44:34,030 --> 03:44:35,620
What about your career?

3276
03:44:36,190 --> 03:44:38,530
Test case will be a fail.

3277
03:44:39,410 --> 03:44:42,310
Wasn't this the reason,
Capt. Shikha Sharma?

3278
03:44:45,950 --> 03:44:47,110
Or is the matter something else?

3279
03:44:49,080 --> 03:44:51,110
Maybe you enjoyed having me
on top of you.

3280
03:44:54,020 --> 03:44:55,470
I felt it.

3281
03:44:55,560 --> 03:44:57,860
That's why you stopped here
as soon as you got the chance.

3282
03:45:00,450 --> 03:45:01,560
Listen.

3283
03:45:01,970 --> 03:45:04,540
There is still time left
for the task to complete.

3284
03:45:06,650 --> 03:45:08,850
You want me to finish
what we started?

3285
03:45:10,190 --> 03:45:11,870
I know you like it rough.

3286
03:45:12,560 --> 03:45:14,560
You f*****g bastard.

3287
03:45:16,620 --> 03:45:19,060
I knew you would again do
something like this.

3288
03:45:19,830 --> 03:45:21,690
I am scared...

3289
03:45:21,800 --> 03:45:24,180
This is a simulation exercise,
Capt. Shikha.

3290
03:45:24,620 --> 03:45:25,870

Drop the gun.

Drop the gun.

3294
03:45:33,110 --> 03:45:34,120
Tell me. What were you saying?

3295
03:45:34,200 --> 03:45:35,560
- Shikha, what are you doing?
It might fire. - Tell me.

3296
03:45:36,320 --> 03:45:37,720
- What?
- F**k, dude.

3297
03:45:37,780 --> 03:45:38,780
What does this mean, Shikha?

3298
03:45:38,850 --> 03:45:40,700
This means you are f*****g dead,
you a*****e.

3299
03:45:41,160 --> 03:45:42,170
And you know what.

3300
03:45:42,250 --> 03:45:44,020
I will finish what you started.
- Shikha, listen to me.

3301
03:45:44,100 --> 03:45:46,030
I made a mistake by not
shooting you the last time.

3302
03:45:46,070 --> 03:45:47,630
This time I won't repeat
the mistake, Manit.

3303
03:45:47,810 --> 03:45:49,690
Shikha, listen. Easy. Look.

3304
03:45:51,340 --> 03:45:53,660
It's not just your dream.
It's also your mom's dream.

- Easy...
- Shut up.

3306
03:45:55,110 --> 03:45:56,870
Your brother committed
suicide, Shikha...

3307
03:45:56,940 --> 03:45:59,030
...when he couldn't fulfil
this dream. You've got a chance.

3308
03:45:59,110 --> 03:46:01,880
The Ministry of Defence chose you
among so many girls, Shikha.

3309
03:46:01,970 --> 03:46:03,470
You can't do this.
- Move back.

I am not doing anything.

If you pull the trigger, Shikha...

3315

...you'll end up in jail.

- Shut up.

- How can you shoot me, Shikha?
I... - Shut up.

And this is just the beginning.

3436
03:56:17,420 --> 03:56:19,230
Like I always say...

3437
03:56:19,970 --> 03:56:23,400
...that patriotism
doesn't have a gender.

3438
03:56:25,740 --> 03:56:28,110
Now, I would like to request
Colonel Sathe...

3439
03:56:28,190 --> 03:56:32,210
...to award the prestigious
Commando Dagger of the SFTC...

3440
03:56:32,820 --> 03:56:35,380
...to Capt. Sharma.

3441
03:56:35,700 --> 03:56:40,730
"Winning is my habit.
That spells doom for my enemies."

3442
03:56:40,820 --> 03:56:45,720
"The love for India
runs in my veins."

3443
03:56:45,980 --> 03:56:51,190
"The motive of my life
is to protect this country."

3444
03:56:51,250 --> 03:56:56,280
"The love for India
runs in my veins."

3445
03:56:56,410 --> 03:57:01,400
"I am not weak.
I am no less than anyone."

3446
03:57:01,630 --> 03:57:06,430
"I don't mind dying."

3447
03:57:06,890 --> 03:57:12,150
"I take pride in saying
that the tricolour is my life."

3448
03:57:12,190 --> 03:57:16,040
"The love for India
runs in my veins."

3449
03:57:17,440 --> 03:57:22,410
"The love for India
runs in my veins."

3450
03:57:22,480 --> 03:57:28,290
"The love for India
runs in my veins."

3451
03:57:30,890 --> 03:57:33,400
Didn't I tell you
that she is strong?

3452
03:57:36,310 --> 03:57:37,570
[Trumpets blaring]

3453
03:57:38,540 --> 03:57:40,700
[People clapping]

3454
03:58:06,870 --> 03:58:09,690
"The love for India
runs in my veins."

3455
03:58:09,730 --> 03:58:12,510
"The love for India
runs in my veins."

3456
03:58:12,550 --> 03:58:16,530
"I will turn the tables around
by flying high."

3457
03:58:17,730 --> 03:58:22,230
"I'll win the fight.
Just resolve to win."

3458
03:58:22,480 --> 03:58:24,880
"Just resolve to win."

3459
03:58:45,770 --> 03:58:53,270
"The love for India
runs in my veins."
