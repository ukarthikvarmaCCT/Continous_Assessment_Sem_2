00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,954
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,954 --> 00:00:03,869
About 100 million years ago,

3
00:00:03,869 --> 00:00:06,274
Earth looked completely different.

4
00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:12,207
With no humans, some scary animals were ruling over this planet.

5
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:13,727
Dinosaurs.

6
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:22,999
Dinosaurs so big, that they were taller than buildings.

7
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:28,191
With jaws so strong, that they could have crushed your bones within a second.

8
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:33,467
They were so fast, that they ran at around the speed of 90km/hr.

9
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,506
They were truly fear-arousing creatures.

10
00:00:36,506 --> 00:00:41,195
They ruled over Earth for more than 170 million years.

11
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:44,022
But then one day, something happened,

12
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:47,491
That completely wiped them off the planet.

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,204
What happened exactly?

14
00:00:50,204 --> 00:00:51,766
And how?

15
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:53,972
Come, let’s understand this in today’s video.

16
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:59,115
“As it gets closer to the planet,
Earth’s gravitational pull gets stronger.”

17
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:01,363
“They now can’t see what’s headed their way.”

18
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:10,861
Friends, the word ‘Dinosaur’ originated from Greek.

19
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:14,016
From the words Denios and Sauros.

20
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:16,827
Denios means Terrible.
And Sauros means Lizard.

21
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,445
A terrible lizard.

22
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:22,098
This is the literal meaning of the word Dinosaur.

23
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:25,517
The word was used for the first time in 1841.

24
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:29,290
When dinosaur fossil was discovered for the first time.

25
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,492
Richard Owen, a British scientist used the word dinosaur.

26
00:01:34,492 --> 00:01:39,328
Back then, people did not know much about dinosaurs or their appearance.

27
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,706
So the initial drawings of how dinosaurs might have looked

28
00:01:43,706 --> 00:01:46,060
Are vastly different from what we know now.

29
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,616
Megalosaurus was one of the first fossils to be discovered.

30
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:51,886
Look at the initial drawings of it.

31
00:01:51,886 --> 00:01:55,695
Decades later, as the researchers discovered more information about them,

32
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:57,834
The drawings were modified.

33
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,286
Trying to make them more realistic.

34
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,998
So the depictions look like this now.

35
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,749
Today, more than 10,000 dinosaur fossils

36
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:09,195
have been unearthed by palaeontologists worldwide,

37
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:13,457
And more than 900 distinct have been identified.

38
00:02:13,457 --> 00:02:17,674
You might be excited by the prospect of discovering more fossils.

39
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:21,553
But interestingly, from 2003 to 2022,

40
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:26,530
On average, each year, about 45 new species of dinosaurs have been identified.

41
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,211
The work of palaeontologists is far from over.

42
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:34,093
Look at the photos of the new species of dinosaurs discovered last year.

43
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:39,565
Of them, this is a bizarre dinosaur discovered in Chile,

44
00:02:39,565 --> 00:02:42,637
with a weapon that looks like a blade on its tail,

45
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:43,940
And a beak for a mouth,

46
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,838
It was named Stegouros Elengassen.

47
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:50,514
Overall, we know a lot about dinosaurs today.

48
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:52,781
But come, let’s start this story at the beginning.

49
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:55,092
Let’s dive into the past.

50
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,081
Millions of years ago.

51
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,312
Scientists estimate that the first dinosaur

52
00:03:04,312 --> 00:03:09,470
emerged about 230-240 million years.

53
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,519
Because the oldest dinosaur fossils that we have found till now

54
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,451
Is from 231.4 million years ago in Africa.

55
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:21,782
Back then, Earth was much different than it is today.

56
00:03:21,782 --> 00:03:23,490
The continents that you see now,

57
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,437
Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe,

58
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:28,393
All continents were joined together.

59
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:30,697
There was only one supercontinent.

60
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:33,223
That we call Pangaea.

61
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:35,714
Scientists believe that Pangaea looked somewhat like this.

62
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:40,917
You can even see the placement of the continents that we know.

63
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:46,860
Then the climate of Earth was dry and arid with only a little rain.

64
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,298
This time period has been named the Triassic Period.

65
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:54,138
The era when the dinosaurs had started emerging.

66
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:58,201
Dinosaurs were slowly populating the Earth due to evolution.

67
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:02,423
The dinosaurs of this era, aren’t anything like the ones you imagine.

68
00:04:02,423 --> 00:04:04,185
They were quite small in size.

69
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:06,365
The common dinosaurs of the time,

70
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:08,830
Were generally around 2 meters long only.

71
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,788
For example, Eoraptor, was a dinosaur that existed in that period.

72
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:18,666
In fact, this dinosaur is known as the ancestor of other dinosaurs.

73
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:22,202
The dominant animals of the era

74
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:23,874
Were giant reptiles.

75
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,618
Some of these reptiles looked cute

76
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:30,723
Like this one, that’s believed to be the ancestor of all turtles.

77
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:34,610
With time, Earth started changing.

78
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,000
201 million years ago, the Triassic period ended.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,916
When Earth’s climate changed suddenly.

80
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,893
The Pangaea started breaking apart.

81
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:47,083
Although I am using the word ‘suddenly’

82
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,984
It didn’t happen in a day or two,

83
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:51,226
It was relatively sudden.

84
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:53,695
In the time scale of millions of years,

85
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:56,356
It happened gradually over thousands of years.

86
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:58,111
Cracks appeared in the supercontinent.

87
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:01,589
Large-scale volcanic explosions took place on and around the cracks.

88
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:03,376
Due to the numerous volcanic eruptions,

89
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:07,479
a large amount of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide was released into the atmosphere.

90
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:10,082
This caused intense global warming.

91
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:13,596
When the sulphur dioxides and aerosols entered the atmosphere,

92
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:16,074
It blocked the sunlight and caused some cooling.

93
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:18,526
Acidification of the oceans started

94
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,275
When the carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide mixed with the water.

95
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:24,099
The acidity of the ocean water increased.

96
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:26,620
The climate was changing rapidly.

97
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,983
And survival became difficult for the animals that existed.

98
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:34,729
Most reptiles and other species back then were cold-blooded animals.

99
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,650
They couldn’t withstand the temperature changes.

100
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,235
But the dinosaurs were warm-blooded like humans.

101
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:44,984
It was easier for the dinosaurs to tolerate the temperature changes.

102
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:49,380
The volcanic eruptions and climate change continued for about 600,000 years.

103
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,367
Due to this, almost all the other species became extinct.

104
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:58,834
The only animals remaining on Earth were the dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, and early mammals.

105
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:03,413
This event is known as the Triassic-Jurassic Extinction Event.

106
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:06,864
As I said, after this, the Triassic period ended.

107
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:09,027
And the Jurassic period began.

108
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:11,148
If this sounds like a familiar name,

109
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:15,662
This is the inspiration for the name of the Jurassic Park films.

110
00:06:15,662 --> 00:06:18,455
The word Jurassic refers to this Jurassic Period.

111
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:25,256
The Jurassic period lasted from 201 million ago to 145 million years ago.

112
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:29,833
During this time, dinosaurs emerged as the most dominant species on the planet.

113
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,485
Due to evolution, some of them became quite large in size.

114
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:35,839
Like some of the earliest Titanosaurus.

115
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,791
They lived around 160 million years ago.

116
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,737
Each of them weighed up to 15,000 kg.

117
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:45,003
And could be up to 15 metres long.

118
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:47,194
Some other iconic dinosaurs of the time were

119
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,352
During the Jurassic period, some dinosaurs evolved to fly.

120
00:06:57,352 --> 00:07:01,844
One of the first feathered dinosaurs was Archaeopteryx.

121
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:03,604
It looked somewhat like this.

122
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:06,491
At this time, the Pangaea supercontinent,

123
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:08,341
Was divided into two.

124
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:10,317
Two smaller supercontinents.

125
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:13,474
We named them Laurasia and Gondwanaland.

126
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,052
Friends, due to the Jurassic Park films,

127
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:18,213
The Jurassic period is the most widely known.

128
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:24,573
But it was the next period when dinosaurs truly flourished.

129
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,371
The Cretaceous period.

130
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:30,848
Because at this time, we saw an explosion in the diversity of dinosaurs.

131
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:34,157
Several new species of dinosaurs evolved.

132
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:38,374
T-Rex, perhaps, the most famous dinosaur to be shown in films.

133
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,997
Existed in the Cretaceous period.

134
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,519
It reached peak dominance only at the end of the Cretaceous period.

135
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:48,165
Around 65-68 million years ago.

136
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:50,530
Though this is debated among researchers,

137
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,754
Most scientists believe that T-Rex didn’t exist in the Jurassic period.

138
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:59,554
It’s quite ironic that in the film ‘Jurassic’ Park,

139
00:07:59,554 --> 00:08:02,103
T-Rex is used for their logo.

140
00:08:02,103 --> 00:08:06,049
The Cretaceous period was the longest time in the era of dinosaurs.

141
00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:08,611
Starting around 145 million years ago

142
00:08:08,611 --> 00:08:11,528
It lasted til 65 million years ago.

143
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:14,857
The 2 supercontinents, Laurasia and Gondwanaland,

144
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:17,022
Started breaking up,

145
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:18,782
And the structure of the continents,

146
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:21,467
Looked similar to what we see today.
Several flowering plants evolved at this time.

147
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,903
Several flowering plants evolved around this time.

148
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:29,112
And the average temperature of the Earth was warmer than it was in the past.

149
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:30,904
Sea levels were quite high,

150
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:34,404
And almost all kinds of dinosaurs that you can imagine,

151
00:08:34,404 --> 00:08:36,703
Existed during this period.

152
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:38,879
Raptors, Armored Dinosaurs,

153
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,981
Giant herbivorous dinosaurs,

154
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:43,573
Dangerous carnivorous dinosaurs.

155
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:47,441
Titanosaurus, one of the largest land animals.

156
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:50,889
Argentinosaurus, which could weigh up to 77 tonnes.

157
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,727
And T-Rex that could be up to 40 feet long

158
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:56,688
Believed to be the apex predator of its time.

159
00:08:56,688 --> 00:09:02,278
It had the strongest and most powerful jaws compared to any other animal.

160
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:05,982
A fun fact, the evolution of grass

161
00:09:05,982 --> 00:09:08,049
began only 70 million years ago.

162
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,439
In the story that I have been telling you,

163
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:13,230
Don’t imagine a grass-filled Earth.

164
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,872
There were other kinds of plants.

165
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:21,666
T-Rex and Triceratops evolved 68 million years ago,

166
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,247
Do you know what this means?

167
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:27,140
We are closer to the dinosaur T-Rex

168
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,496
Than it was to the Jurassic Period.

169
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:34,060
Since there's 80 million years between the Jurassic period and the T-Rex evolution.

170
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,326
But only 68 million years between us and T-Rex.

171
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:41,503
Another interesting dinosaur that existed then

172
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:42,851
Were the Ornithomimids.

173
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:44,787
They looked like ostriches,

174
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:46,928
They were among the fastest dinosaurs.

175
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:49,353
They could run at the speed of 80 km/hr.

176
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:51,616
And in terms of flying, instead of running,

177
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:55,011
The largest flying dinosaur was Quetzalcoatlus,

178
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,913
Had a wingspan of 10-11 meters.

179
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:01,312
As you can see, this was the most prosperous period for dinosaurs.

180
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:05,140
The climate was favouring them, new species were evolving,

181
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,901
And there were no other animal species to compete with them.

182
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,863
They were simply ruling over Earth.

183
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:13,682
Everything was going well,

184
00:10:13,682 --> 00:10:20,656
Until one day, something happened that completely wiped off dinosaurs from Earth forever.

185
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:25,299
A large asteroid, with a diameter of roughly 10-15 km,

186
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:29,808
Came hurling towards Earth and crashed into it.

187
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:33,445
This happened 66 million years ago.

188
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:37,609
And this asteroid strike ended the Cretaceous period.

189
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,779
The speed of the asteroid was 30 km per second.

190
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,593
150 times faster than a jet airliner.

191
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:55,163
Specifically speaking, it hit the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.

192
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:59,719
The same place where millions of years later, the Mayan tribe emerged.

193
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:03,074
And built historical wonders like Chichen Itza.

194
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:06,281
I explored the Yucatan Peninsula in my vlogs as well.

195
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:08,936
You can watch the vlogs of this place if you want to.

196
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:11,024
The link will be in the description.

197
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:13,981
When the asteroid hit Earth,

198
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,873
It created a large crater.

199
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:18,330
With a diameter of 180 km,

200
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,854
Due to its impact, energy was released at such a speed,

201
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:27,115
That could be released with 100 teratonnes of TNT.
[100 trillion tonne or 100,000 trillion kg]

202
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:30,894
If you compare this with the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

203
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:34,843
The asteroid produced 1 billion times their energy.

204
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:36,821
This was such a big impact,

205
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,638
That everything around it disintegrated in the blink of an eye.

206
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:43,544
The impact threw a lot of soil into the air,

207
00:11:43,544 --> 00:11:45,766
The land heated up,

208
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:49,988
And the hot dust rained over the other areas.

209
00:11:49,988 --> 00:11:55,268
The global temperatures rose by several degrees for hours.

210
00:11:55,268 --> 00:11:58,511
All animals within thousands of kilometres of range from here,

211
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,528
Were cooked alive by the sheer heat.

212
00:12:00,528 --> 00:12:06,150
It’s believed that only small animals could survive the impact of this initial blast.

213
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,483
Because they found underground shelter.

214
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:14,420
Or they hid underwater, in caves, or in large tree trunks.

215
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,087
But this was only the initial impact.

216
00:12:17,087 --> 00:12:20,564
This was followed by shock waves, heat pulses,

217
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:23,726
Wildfires in the forests for thousands of kilometres.

218
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:25,869
And big tsunamis.

219
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:29,403
It’s speculated that there would have been an immediate tsunami with a 2 km tall wave.

220
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:32,018
Can you even imagine a 2 km tall tsunami wave?

221
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,474
Volcanic eruptions started once again.

222
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:38,021
Acid rain fell and earthquakes occurred.

223
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:40,305
The short-term effects were quite deadly.

224
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:41,720
But you would think that,

225
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,858
on the other side of the Earth, that wasn’t hit,

226
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:46,608
Animals could have perhaps survived there.

227
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:50,874
But the long-term consequences were even deadlier.

228
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:52,952
The dust particles in the air

229
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:57,861
Blocked sunlight for the next year all around the planet.

230
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,264
The planet went into a nuclear winter.

231
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:02,532
The temperature dropped drastically.

232
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,170
It’s estimated that for the next 3 years,

233
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,872
The earth was at freezing temperatures.

234
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:10,119
It killed many plants and animals.

235
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:12,562
Since the sunlight was blocked for 1 year,

236
00:13:12,562 --> 00:13:15,834
It was impossible for plants to use photosynthesis.

237
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:17,389
The plants died.

238
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:21,686
With dying plants, the herbivorous animals had nothing to eat and they died out.

239
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:26,065
Even the carnivorous animals were left with nothing to eat, and they too died out.

240
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:28,374
A chain reaction was caused.

241
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,338
The only animals safe of these consequences,

242
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:34,110
Were small omnivorous animals.

243
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,047
Such as mammals, lizards, turtles, and some birds.

244
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:40,423
These animals could survive because

245
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:42,839
They could survive as scavengers as well.

246
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:48,658
The dead dinosaurs, fungus, decaying plant matter,

247
00:13:48,658 --> 00:13:50,505
These were the food that kept them alive.

248
00:13:50,505 --> 00:13:54,515
These small creatures could survive for a significant amount of time.

249
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:58,197
The impact of the asteroid had destroyed carbonate rocks too.

250
00:13:58,197 --> 00:14:02,042
This caused carbon and sulphur to be released into the atmosphere once again,

251
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,674
And for the next several thousand years,

252
00:14:04,674 --> 00:14:07,477
The sunlight was significantly reduced.

253
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:09,348
That was not at the normal levels.

254
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,900
Apart from this, acid rain continued for thousands of years.

255
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,778
When the nuclear winter ended,

256
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:19,380
The dust in the atmosphere settled down,

257
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,031
Sunlight reached the planet once again.

258
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:25,764
But the problem was that a large quantity of carbon dioxide was already released into the atmosphere.

259
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,989
This caused intense global warming.

260
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:30,427
Think about this friends,

261
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:35,083
One asteroid changed earth’s history for the next thousands of years.

262
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,257
If we ignore a few exceptions,

263
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:42,113
No 4-legged creature weighing more than 25 kg,

264
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:44,906
Could survive this event.

265
00:14:44,906 --> 00:14:48,064
All terrestrial dinosaurs went extinct.

266
00:14:48,064 --> 00:14:52,177
And with them, the plant and animal species once thriving on Earth,

267
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:55,385
More than 75% of it went extinct.

268
00:14:55,385 --> 00:14:58,851
Friends, at this point, the Cretaceous period ended.

269
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:00,841
And the next era began.

270
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:03,805
The Paleogene period.

271
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:05,930
Friends, it wasn’t as if everything had ended.

272
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,942
This event was like an opportunity for the rest of the animal species.

273
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:17,363
The rulers of the planet, Dinosaurs, were no more.

274
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:22,774
So it was an opportunity for the other animals to come up and rule.

275
00:15:22,774 --> 00:15:26,316
Humans should be thankful for this asteroid

276
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:29,484
Because this awarded a good opportunity for the evolution of mammals,

277
00:15:29,484 --> 00:15:31,179
After the extinction of dinosaurs.

278
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:34,016
The gap in the food chain left by the dinosaurs,

279
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,454
Was filled in by several mammals.

280
00:15:36,454 --> 00:15:42,536
It was in this period that we saw the evolution of horses, whales, bats, and primates.

281
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:46,948
Several snakes and smaller lizards started emerging in this period.

282
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:50,067
The only group of dinosaurs that could survive,

283
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:51,976
were the flying dinosaurs.

284
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:56,246
Gradually they evolved and became the birds that we now know.

285
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,724
Yup, you read that right.

286
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,349
The birds that you see flying around today,

287
00:16:00,349 --> 00:16:03,296
The flying dinosaurs are their ancestors.

288
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,403
Most studies have confirmed that,

289
00:16:05,403 --> 00:16:08,890
Birds belong to the same family as dinosaurs.

290
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,134
Specifically speaking, ancestry is shared most closely by

291
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:14,302
Chickens and ostriches.

292
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:16,745
This is why people might say that

293
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:22,384
The closest living relative of T-Rex, a dangerous dinosaur,

294
00:16:22,384 --> 00:16:25,033
Is a chicken.

295
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:28,328
You might have a question about the asteroid.

296
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:29,967
How did we find out,

297
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:32,176
The spot where the asteroid crashed?

298
00:16:32,176 --> 00:16:34,754
And that it crashed 66 million years ago?

299
00:16:34,754 --> 00:16:36,177
How did we figure out the date?

300
00:16:36,177 --> 00:16:39,097
This is evidenced by a rare mineral.

301
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:40,380
Iridium.

302
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,762
Scientists found that at a few places on Earth,

303
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:48,591
We have a high concentration of iridium on the ground.

304
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,946
But when the geologists analysed Earth,

305
00:16:50,946 --> 00:16:54,544
they found that it is a very rare mineral on Earth.

306
00:16:54,544 --> 00:16:58,447
Despite that, it is so abundant on our ground.

307
00:16:58,447 --> 00:16:59,990
How could this be?

308
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,932
This could happen because comets and asteroids,

309
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:06,485
Have a high concentration of iridium.

310
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:09,567
And when scientists put the iridium into carbon dating,

311
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:12,526
They found that the iridium layer that we find,

312
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:14,804
Is 66 million years old.

313
00:17:14,804 --> 00:17:18,211
This could happen only when the asteroid hit the planet

314
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:24,220
And in the pursuing blast, this mineral spread all around.

315
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,803
You might also wonder that since the asteroid had an impact this big,

316
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:32,024
We should be able to see the crater it left on Earth.

317
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:35,142
Well, you are not wrong.

318
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:38,600
But an event that occurred so long ago,
66 million years ago,

319
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,319
Might not look like you’d imagine it to be.

320
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:45,534
Because since then, the continents have been relentlessly shifting.

321
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:50,925
The crater of this asteroid is hidden in the Yucatan Peninsula.

322
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:54,107
But several digging expeditions were conducted,

323
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:57,390
That proved that it had actually happened,

324
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,199
And the exact location it happened.

325
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:02,356
If you look at the map, this is the exact location.

326
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:04,236
Half of it is submerged under the sea,

327
00:18:04,236 --> 00:18:05,627
And the other half is on land.

328
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,753
A real-world impact that we can still see

329
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:12,039
Are the cenotes in this Mexican area.

330
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:18,660
These beautiful sinkholes show a pattern.

331
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,810
The crater formed by the asteroid,

332
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:25,280
The cenotes can be found in a ring formation around the crater.

333
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,670
Nowadays they are famous tourist attractions.

334
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,061
You can go swimming in these cenotes.

335
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:36,574
And overall, these cenotes, form the world’s largest underground cave system.

336
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,619
After hearing this astounding story of this asteroid strike,

337
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,934
You might be thinking about what would happen

338
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:46,134
If such an asteroid comes and hits the planet now?

339
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:48,682
Will humans go extinct?

340
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:51,973
This is definitely a threat.

341
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:55,150
The asteroids that might hit Earth in the foreseeable future,

342
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,922
Are known as Near Earth Asteroids,

343
00:18:57,922 --> 00:19:00,273
NASA and other space agencies are

344
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,472
continuously tracking all near-earth asteroids

345
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:05,952
To compute their path and if and when they will collide with Earth.

346
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:11,843
As of April 2022, more than 28,000 near earth asteroids have been identified.

347
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:15,896
Of which more than 800 have a diameter of 1 km or more.

348
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:17,613
This is a scary number.

349
00:19:17,613 --> 00:19:21,181
So many asteroids that may potentially collide with Earth.

350
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:24,355
But today, you don’t need to be scared about this.

351
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:26,918
Because scientific calculations are so advanced that

352
00:19:26,918 --> 00:19:29,509
We can clearly predict their path,

353
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:32,777
And can calculate the exact location of the impact.

354
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:37,659
We can even estimate the chances of it actually colliding with Earth.

355
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:39,682
And if they are indeed on a path of collision,

356
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:42,019
What can we do to stop it?

357
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:46,315
This was the idea behind NASA’s DART space mission launched in 2021.

358
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:48,348
Double Asteroid Redirection Test.

359
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:52,717
They planned to have a spacecraft collide with an asteroid,

360
00:19:52,717 --> 00:19:54,775
So that the path of the asteroid can be altered.

361
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:58,544
And if, in future, there’s an asteroid about to collide with Earth,

362
00:19:58,544 --> 00:20:00,722
We can alter its path.

363
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:02,758
This might sound like science fiction.

364
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:05,187
But this idea was already successful.

365
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:07,588
In September 2022, a test was launched

366
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:10,688
On an asteroid that was not on the path towards Earth,

367
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:12,420
NASA sent a spacecraft to it,

368
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,213
The spacecraft collided with the asteroid,
and its path was altered.

369
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,635
If they could successfully do it to that asteroid,

370
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:20,992
It can be done to any asteroid on the way to Earth in future.

371
00:20:20,992 --> 00:20:24,027
But that doesn’t mean that there’s no danger at all.

372
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:26,820
Humans are the danger here.

373
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:32,391
The asteroid strike that killed the dinosaurs,
Is known as the 5th extinction event in Earth’s history.

374
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:36,529
After this, scientists believe that the 6th extinction event,

375
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:38,140
Has already begun.

376
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,082
This isn’t due to any volcano or asteroid,

377
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:42,354
It is caused by humans.

378
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:45,432
This is named the Holocene Extinction Event.

379
00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:47,049
Over the last 100-200 years,

380
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:51,358
We have seen the loss of biodiversity at an unprecedented scale.

381
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:57,380
Animals and plant species are rapidly going extinct due to humans,

382
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,401
Biologists agree that it is a mass extinction.

383
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,730
Deforestation by humans

384
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,327
Pollution in oceans and atmosphere,

385
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:13,617
Due to this, the normal rate is more than 100-1,000 times more than the current rate of extinction.

386
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:16,909
Habitats of the animals that exist now,

387
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,636
Are being destroyed.

388
00:21:18,636 --> 00:21:21,591
Thousands of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians,

389
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:24,771
Are now in the endangered category

390
00:21:24,771 --> 00:21:27,283
Or have already gone extinct due to humans.

391
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:28,995
To stop this destruction,

392
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:34,584
a United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity Meeting was held in Japan in 2010.

393
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,449
20 biodiversity targets were set

394
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:38,860
To be achieved by 2020.

395
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,811
Unfortunately, only 6 of those have been partially achieved.

396
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:45,945
In January 2020, a new Paris-style plan was 
set

397
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:49,223
to prevent biodiversity and ecosystem collapse.

398
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:51,657
The deadline was set as 2030.

399
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:54,995
Its purpose is to ensure that 30%

400
00:21:54,995 --> 00:21:58,723
of the land and oceans are given the status of being protected.

401
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:02,845
To reduce pollution by at least 50%.

402
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:06,405
Scientists have proposed that the extinctions taking place,

403
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:10,240
Need to be limited to 20 per year or fewer.

404
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,568
We’ll have to see how many targets can be met.

405
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:14,795
But one thing is certain that

406
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:16,291
it is important to do these,

407
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:20,570
Because if plants and animals species go extinct now

408
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,703
In the same way, it happened in the previous extinction events,

409
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:27,512
Perhaps it wouldn’t be possible for humans to survive.

410
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,315
It’s interesting to note that

411
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:30,966
As per calculations, humans originated

412
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:33,429
merely 300,000 years ago in Africa.

413
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:35,019
As per the data.

414
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:37,104
Compared to the dinosaurs,

415
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:42,673
Who were the dominant species on Earth for 174 million years.

416
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:44,541
We’ve been here for only 300,000 years,

417
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:47,748
While they lived for 174 million years,

418
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:50,426
600 times longer than humans.

419
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:51,536
What do you think?

420
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,956
Can humans beat the record set by dinosaurs?

421
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:59,287
Or will humans go extinct before they’re 1 million years old?

422
00:22:59,287 --> 00:23:02,173
Comment below with your opinion.

423
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,655
Obviously, the right answer will depend on,

424
00:23:04,655 --> 00:23:08,744
Our collective efforts to save this planet.
