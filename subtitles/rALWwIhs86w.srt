1
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:14,669
The almighty has blessed us
with a baby boy.

2
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,357
Great! Didn't I tell you?

3
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:20,494
Priest sir, please prepare the
horoscope of the boy. Note the time.

4
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:25,035
Surely, I will prepare it properly.
First, tell me the right time.

5
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:28,694
Let me tell you. Sharp 5:00 am.

6
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,631
How are you so sure?

7
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,455
When our maid, Parvati comes and
knocks the door at 5am sharp.

8
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:37,236
Look, the bell is ringing.

9
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:39,795
This girl is never late.

10
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,413
Priest sir, please prepare
the horoscope immediately. - Sure.

11
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:47,801
Come, Parvati. You have
come at the right time.

12
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:50,862
What's the matter, ma'am?
All of you are up at 5 am today!

13
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:54,568
The matter is...
- That she has delivered a baby.

14
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:57,023
Hey, how did you learn about it?

15
00:02:57,137 --> 00:03:01,626
Last night, when I was leaving
for home, I saw her face.

16
00:03:01,976 --> 00:03:05,643
I saw the shine on her face and I knew
it that she will deliver the baby.

17
00:03:05,773 --> 00:03:10,767
Oh dear! You aren't even married yet.
How did you know of these things?

18
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:11,991
What are you saying, ma'am?

19
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:16,247
My mom delivered three kids after
me and we didn't have a nanny.

20
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,193
I was always with her.
My mom has given birth to 8 kids.

21
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:24,836
She herself says that no nanny
can help the way I did. - I see.

22
00:03:25,548 --> 00:03:29,406
Listen, Parvati, I won't be able to
come to the kitchen for a few days.

23
00:03:29,554 --> 00:03:32,577
You come at 5 am usually.
Tomorrow onwards come by 4 am.

24
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,359
Take care of all the
household chores properly.

25
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:40,244
Don't worry, ma'am. You take care of
the baby, I'll take care of the house.

26
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:59,665
Parvati, is all the work done?
- Yes, ma'am.

27
00:03:59,796 --> 00:04:02,060
So many people will
be coming to see the baby.

28
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:04,117
We'll have to arrange for snacks.

29
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:09,093
I knew you'd be saying this.
I have already started preparing.

30
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,031
The tea is almost ready.
I have to just pour it in the cups.

31
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,365
Great! You are very smart.

32
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:17,191
Shall I take your leave?
I have to go to two more houses.

33
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:22,772
If you need me then send a message
for me home, I'll come. - Alright, dear.

34
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:46,869
Parvati.
- What is it, sir?

35
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,862
Tell me, sir.

36
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:54,114
It's nothing. My room is very
dirty since so many days.

37
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:58,027
The dust is getting accumulated.
No one is bothered.

38
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:00,955
Won't you clean it?

39
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:03,197
Alright. I'll do it.

40
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:16,093
Parvati.

41
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:25,140
Tell me. - It's been so many days
since you have been working here.

42
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:27,656
But you never talk to me.

43
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:30,423
If I keep talking
then who will work?

44
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:32,976
Work goes on, Parvati.

45
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,637
But if you need anything..

46
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:37,756
..then don't you think you
have the right to ask me?

47
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:42,110
Me? I work here and I take my
salary from ma'am for that.

48
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:46,451
I know you do. But you can take
something from the owner as well.

49
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:50,633
You can money, saris,
clothes, jewellery.

50
00:05:50,714 --> 00:05:52,335
Hey! Listen!

51
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:55,132
What were you telling Parvati?

52
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:59,335
I was saying... I...
- Go ahead. Why are you fumbling?

53
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:03,085
It's nothing, ma'am. Sir is
suddenly worried about me.

54
00:06:03,273 --> 00:06:06,811
He was asking me why I didn't
get married as of yet.

55
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,179
Yes. That's what I was asking.

56
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:13,891
Yes, Parvati. I, too wanted to ask you.
When will you get married?

57
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:15,667
This is the right age.

58
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:20,395
What can I do, ma'am? Destiny can
do nothing in front of poverty.

59
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,457
We are 8 kids in the house.
I am the eldest.

60
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:30,473
You tell me, how can I think about
getting married in such a situation?

61
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:33,346
Dad didn't leave us any money.

62
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,962
He just increased the number
of family members and died.

63
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:40,364
And my mom is there but
she can't do anything.

64
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,848
I have six younger sisters.

65
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:47,296
And one of them is dumb.

66
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,539
What can I do, ma'am?
I just have one brother.

67
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:54,026
I am funding his MBBS education
with great difficulty.

68
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:58,206
"Aa O Meena, Super Seena."

69
00:06:58,309 --> 00:07:02,650
"Big Boys, Lazy girls..."
- Enough, stop shouting.

70
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,499
Come here. Can't you see
Suresh is studying?

71
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:10,191
I have told you so many times, when
he is studying, don't make noise.

72
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:12,293
C'mon! Go out and play.

73
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:13,991
Kamla, come here.

74
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:19,237
They are younger to you. Let them
play outside. Why are you going?

75
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,289
Are you a kid to play with them?

76
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:26,754
Yes, yes... Let it be. Listen,
we need to eat in the afternoon, right?

77
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,398
Then go inside, turn on the
stove and start preparing lunch.

78
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:34,819
Parvati, you asked her
to turn on the stove.

79
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:37,448
But is there anything
to eat at home?

80
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:42,583
Mom, you always say negative
before even checking.

81
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:45,857
Yesterday, I bought 4 kg rice.

82
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:48,998
In the second box on the
third shelf in the kitchen..

83
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:52,083
..I have put all the rice.
Haven't you seen? - No.

84
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,165
Great! Come, I'll show you.

85
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,842
Why, mom? You know Suresh is
sitting there and studying.

86
00:08:00,117 --> 00:08:03,902
I have told you so many
times don't say such things..

87
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:06,440
..so loudly that Suresh can hear.

88
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:09,833
Why wouldn't I do that?
If there's no food at home..

89
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,685
..won't I tell you about it?
- Of course you can.

90
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:15,486
But you can get me in the kitchen
and tell me about it in person.

91
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:20,485
Suresh is studying. We are funding
his studies with such difficulty.

92
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:23,003
If he gets worried about
the requirement of food..

93
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:28,461
..he won't be able to
study at all, mom. You always...

94
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:33,710
Mom, promise me you won't
say anything to him.

95
00:08:33,823 --> 00:08:36,228
No. No, I won't.

96
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,201
Now tell me. What were you saying?

97
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:42,295
There are grains at home, right?
- Where?

98
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:45,166
You just said that you
have a full box of rice.

99
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:49,468
You expect me to loudly speak in front
of Suresh that there are no grains.

100
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:54,152
What do we do now?
- Mom, why do you have to cry?

101
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:56,444
We aren't rich people.

102
00:08:56,715 --> 00:09:00,531
Here, even if people have money
they don't have it for necessities.

103
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:04,583
Don't worry, mom. The stove is turned on
and rice too will be arranged soon.

104
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:08,430
Parvati!
- I think it's arranged.

105
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,143
Please come. What is the matter?

106
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,743
Tomorrow, all of us are
going out for a wedding.

107
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:16,524
Will you be able to stitch four
blouses and petticoat immediately?

108
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:19,594
Yes. You are leaving tomorrow
morning, right? - Yes.

109
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:22,229
I will stitch it today
and send it by tonight.

110
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:26,004
Here you go. Take this money.
Shall I take your leave? - Sure.

111
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:30,420
Go and get it.
- I was saying...

112
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:32,707
That's exactly what I am saying.
Go on, mom.

113
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,460
Yes, dear.

114
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:51,507
Parvati.

115
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:56,067
Only 15 days are left for
the college to reopen. - Oh yes.

116
00:09:57,623 --> 00:09:59,466
You'll need money, right?

117
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:05,394
Hey, Suresh. Why are you worried?

118
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,347
I have arranged for it.

119
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:10,132
That's not the thing, Parvati.
You had said..

120
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,193
..that if there's need
for a large amount..

121
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:14,568
..then I should remind beforehand.
- I do remember.

122
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,691
Now you go and study.

123
00:10:54,855 --> 00:11:02,431
"Who is this who has
shyed the sun's ray!"

124
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:11,208
"Who is this who has
shyed the sun's ray!"

125
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:21,530
"Who is this whose beauty has
fired up the water's bay!"

126
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:28,990
"Who is this whose beauty has
fired up the water's bay!"

127
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:36,656
"Who is this because of whom this
gush of breeze has come our way!"

128
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:43,966
"Who is this because of whom this
gush of breeze has come our way!"

129
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:51,775
"Who is this whose songs have
made the waves to stay!"

130
00:11:51,854 --> 00:12:00,351
"Who is this whose songs have
made the waves to stay!"

131
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:26,521
"Who is this whose intoxicating
tresses have shadowed the waves!"

132
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:36,870
"Who is this whose intoxicating
tresses have shadowed the waves!"

133
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:44,164
"There are no clouds in the sky,
they are all lying on the rivers!"

134
00:12:44,244 --> 00:12:52,252
"There are no clouds in the sky,
they are all lying on the rivers!"

135
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:22,788
"Who is this standing with a
storm of desires in him!"

136
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:32,951
"Who is this standing with a
storm of desires in him!"

137
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:40,302
"I feel so shy, God knows who is
this whom I have come across."

138
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:47,929
"I feel so shy, God knows who is
this whom I have come across."

139
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:55,174
"Who is this whose beauty has
fired up the water's bay!"

140
00:13:55,228 --> 00:14:02,628
"Who is this whose songs have
made the waves to stay!"

141
00:14:02,702 --> 00:14:10,641
"Who is this who has
shyed the sun's ray!"

142
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,430
Parvati, you were praying
so much concentration.

143
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,101
What did you ask from God?

144
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:32,894
My brother, Suresh.
In spite of so many problems..

145
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:35,345
..he has been scoring every year.

146
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:37,622
I was praying..

147
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,589
..that he scores well in
his final year as well..

148
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,688
..and becomes a doctor.
- So that means..

149
00:14:45,048 --> 00:14:48,274
Everything depends on
he becoming a doctor.

150
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,308
Our marriage too. Right.

151
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,906
Isn't it.

152
00:14:54,553 --> 00:14:55,833
Tell me Parvati.

153
00:14:57,986 --> 00:14:59,106
So, it means..

154
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,857
..we will have to wait
for another year.

155
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:04,492
May be more than that.

156
00:15:04,614 --> 00:15:07,277
If you pray to God
the way I ask you to..

157
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:09,403
..then we can get married
within months.

158
00:15:09,514 --> 00:15:13,442
How is that? - You want
your brother to become a doctor.

159
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,766
You want him to take up
all the responsibilities.

160
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:17,378
After that you will marry me.

161
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:22,161
While I think that I want to win
the court case of my wealth.

162
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:23,334
And then I will marry you.

163
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:27,647
That's why, pray to the almighty
that I win the case faster.

164
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:30,922
What if you win?
- I will get wealth of Rs 4,00,000.

165
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:35,684
After that I will take
care of you, your brother..

166
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:39,021
..and all the responsibilities
of your family.

167
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,922
I hope you trust me.

168
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:45,805
Why do you ask that?
- I meant, I hope you don't think..

169
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:48,258
..that when I get the wealth,
I might change my mind.

170
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:52,300
You aren't the kinds whose mind
changes when wealth comes to them.

171
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,485
Parvati.

172
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,215
Hey, what is all this?

173
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:11,233
You had said that you want
to get married again..

174
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:13,213
..and that I must get an
eligible girl for you.

175
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:16,738
I have got these photos and now...
- Rubbish!

176
00:16:16,912 --> 00:16:19,972
Is this all you have? They are all
illiterate girls from the village.

177
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:23,802
They are beautiful.
- You will find everyone beautiful.

178
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,902
I hope you haven't clicked these
photos by wearing the saris yourself.

179
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,775
Why do you think I thought of
getting married again at this age?

180
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:31,798
I am doubtful about it.

181
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,733
Why? My hairs are white.
Is that the reason?

182
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:38,582
I might be 55 but my heart
is still as young as 25.

183
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,257
Sir, I know that but...
- What?

184
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,134
I am not getting married for her
to cook for me or get kids.

185
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,209
I am tired of having 6 kids already.

186
00:16:49,446 --> 00:16:52,586
Then why are you getting married?
- Now you are asking!

187
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,149
Let me tell you. The girl who gets
married now, I will get her right here.

188
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:02,421
I will just stand in front of her
and keep looking at her.

189
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,035
That's it.

190
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:08,650
I want to keep looking at her
for 24 hours 7 days a week.

191
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:11,192
How do you think should she be?
- Why don't you tell me?

192
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:14,774
Useless! You need the eyes for that.

193
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:18,755
Her face should be like
beauty queen Saira Bano. - Okay.

194
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:20,751
How should he waist be?
- How?

195
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,457
Crazy fellow, it should be like Helen.
- Helen.

196
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:26,629
And her walking style...

197
00:17:27,073 --> 00:17:30,895
Just like Vaijanthimala.
I mean to say she should be like..

198
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:33,120
..Padmini. Go and get her.

199
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:37,747
But sir, do you think such a
beauty will get married to you?

200
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,019
Do you think she will marry you?

201
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:46,072
Is there anyone better than me who
can appreciate beauty? - No, sir.

202
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:47,959
Son!

203
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:51,994
Where are you?
- I am right here.

204
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:57,146
But whenever I am doing some work,
why do you come with all of them?

205
00:17:57,256 --> 00:18:02,608
Son, these kids are insisting
on going out for a movie.

206
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:05,620
These kids want to watch a movie!

207
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:08,277
Yes, do you think I am insisting?

208
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:10,137
I understand everything, mom.

209
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:12,696
At this age, you want to
watch movies and theater..

210
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:15,893
..and circus.
- You keep yelling at me.

211
00:18:15,998 --> 00:18:19,313
I thought, they are
kids without a mother.

212
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:22,393
At least they will
go out for a movie.

213
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,726
Well, the idea is good.
Manohar, let them go.

214
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:29,700
The film is really nice. Its
on Tarzan, they will like it.

215
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:33,407
Alright. Go and watch it.
You keep bothering me all the time.

216
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:35,406
Take this. Go.
- Thank you.

217
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:37,573
Go on, mom. You too go.

218
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:42,608
Sir.
- Yes?

219
00:18:42,894 --> 00:18:44,945
This girl is your sister, right?
- Yes.

220
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:47,117
Should I look for a
good boy for her?

221
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:50,375
What a personality! You won't
let go of a client, will you?

222
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,857
I have asked you to
get a girl not a guy.

223
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:57,177
Go. Wear a good spectacles and
take a look all around the city.

224
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,402
And get a girl just the
way I explained you. Go.

225
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:02,144
Alright.
- Listen.

226
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:06,997
No one should know about my marriage
in this house. Neither my mom, sister..

227
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,587
..and nor my brother.

228
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:13,056
If my brother Ratanlal learns
about it, he will break it all.

229
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:16,961
Sir, I have been coming
here since so many days.

230
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:19,324
I have never seen your brother.

231
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:21,421
I have a younger brother.

232
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:24,890
But he is completely opposite
to me in every way possible.

233
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:28,008
He doesn't wish to stay at home,
so he rides a cab.

234
00:19:46,397 --> 00:19:50,229
"My car is a flying machine."

235
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:54,011
"My car is a flying machine."

236
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:57,850
"My car is a flying machine."

237
00:19:57,932 --> 00:20:02,072
"My car is a flying machine."

238
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:09,071
"Some call it a king's chariot and
some call it a bride's palanquin."

239
00:20:09,182 --> 00:20:12,401
"My car is a flying machine."

240
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,177
"My car is a flying machine."

241
00:21:01,524 --> 00:21:08,290
"Why should any traveler
be left behind in this world?"

242
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:11,175
Sir, am I say right?
- You're right.

243
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:18,160
"Why should any traveler
be left behind in this world?"

244
00:21:18,951 --> 00:21:25,973
"Is someone lucky enough to find love?"

245
00:21:26,672 --> 00:21:33,315
"Is someone lucky enough to find love?"

246
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:34,368
Sorry!

247
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:41,580
"The mirror of the heart always
reveals the secrets of love."

248
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,930
"My car is a flying machine."

249
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:49,234
"My car is a flying machine."

250
00:22:28,877 --> 00:22:36,601
"There are a lot of thieves in this
world, some a big and some small."

251
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:44,221
"They roam about as gentlemen
but work as thieves." - What?

252
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:46,446
"That's not for you, sir."

253
00:22:46,544 --> 00:22:53,777
"Their life runs on lies and
they never speak the truth."

254
00:22:53,802 --> 00:22:57,607
"My car is a flying machine."

255
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:01,549
"My car is a flying machine."

256
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:05,458
"My car is a flying machine."

257
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:09,759
"My car is a flying machine."

258
00:23:34,503 --> 00:23:38,215
"My car is a flying machine."

259
00:23:38,262 --> 00:23:42,132
"My car is a flying machine."

260
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:50,236
"My car is a flying machine."

261
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,835
You are back. I was waiting for you.

262
00:23:56,456 --> 00:23:59,151
Tell me clearly.
How much money do you need?

263
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:02,427
I have to pay the college fees.
I have buy books as well.

264
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,248
I was thinking of stitching some
clothes as well. - Okay, for all this..

265
00:24:06,672 --> 00:24:08,474
..Rs 770 is enough, right?

266
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,598
Parvati, the college fees
itself is that much.

267
00:24:11,674 --> 00:24:14,308
Rs 1000 would be enough, right?

268
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:18,653
I will try.
- Listen, I have arranged for the money.

269
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:22,139
I was just asking that how
much do you need now.

270
00:24:22,976 --> 00:24:26,853
Rs 1000 should be enough, Parvati.
- Okay. I'll go and get the money.

271
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:30,065
Stay at home. As soon as I come
back, we'll go to the market.

272
00:24:32,578 --> 00:24:36,990
Please come. - You are inviting me!
First, give me my money back.

273
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:38,918
It's been so many days.
Give it back.

274
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,564
I wanted to give it back myself.

275
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:44,579
How will you give it back?
All you know is taking.

276
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:51,101
You don't know how to refund.
When you need, you always come home.

277
00:24:51,227 --> 00:24:52,650
It is so difficult.

278
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:56,114
Now I am coming to you
to get back my refund.

279
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,905
The Tyre of my car is
messed and so are my shoes.

280
00:24:58,987 --> 00:25:02,440
That's not how it is, Mr. Manoharlal.
I went 5 times to your house.

281
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:04,387
But your mom said
you aren't at home.

282
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:07,635
Whatever she said... I don't
have time for nonsense.

283
00:25:07,703 --> 00:25:09,314
I need my money back.

284
00:25:09,395 --> 00:25:12,375
Mr. Manoharlal, as of now I will
only give you the interest.

285
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,156
I will return the entire
amount next month.

286
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:19,594
That will never happen. I want my
money back right now. - Greetings, sir.

287
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:23,934
Come, dear.
- I need to talk to you.

288
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:27,259
Is it?
- Why don't you come in the evening?

289
00:25:27,301 --> 00:25:28,346
You are a strange man!

290
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:31,208
When the girl has come now then
why call her in the evening?

291
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:34,473
The poor girl must
be in some trouble.

292
00:25:34,614 --> 00:25:37,236
Ask her what she needs.
- Sit down.

293
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:40,907
Let me sort your problem first...
- My problem is not a problem.

294
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:44,044
What's the use if I take
Rs 20,000 from you?

295
00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:47,161
As long as it is with you I
will keep getting my interest.

296
00:25:47,257 --> 00:25:48,413
Ask her what she needs.

297
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:51,436
Alright then... - First, ask her
why she has come to you.

298
00:25:51,595 --> 00:25:55,736
I won't leave until she leaves.
- Sit down.

299
00:25:58,154 --> 00:25:59,716
Come, dear.

300
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:07,274
Just what I wanted.

301
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:09,449
Thanks to you..

302
00:26:09,686 --> 00:26:11,768
..my brother is studying
since so many years.

303
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:14,649
He is in his final year.

304
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:19,584
At this point, I need Rs 1000.
I will be grateful.

305
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:21,259
Why, dear?

306
00:26:21,818 --> 00:26:25,345
As soon as he finishes this year,
will he become a doctor? - Yes.

307
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:28,015
Oh God!

308
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,813
What is the matter? - What can I say?
I don't have money right now.

309
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,934
What? You don't...

310
00:26:36,514 --> 00:26:40,111
I didn't think of it. I came
here with a lot of expectations.

311
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:43,148
You have never refused till date.

312
00:26:43,474 --> 00:26:45,700
You used to give it to me
without me asking for it.

313
00:26:45,832 --> 00:26:47,577
I used to, right?
- Yes.

314
00:26:47,758 --> 00:26:49,665
When I had, I used to give it.

315
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:52,555
Today, I don't have any
then how can I give it?

316
00:26:53,497 --> 00:26:55,741
Sir, why don't you do this?

317
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:59,904
What? - You used to keep our
house in lease and give me money.

318
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:03,309
Yes. - Buy that house
and give me the money.

319
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:07,658
Dear, what do you think I am?
Do you think..

320
00:27:07,845 --> 00:27:10,745
..I gave you money according to the
amount your house is worth of?

321
00:27:10,827 --> 00:27:13,285
You aren't married yet.

322
00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:16,331
You work as a maid in other's house.

323
00:27:16,611 --> 00:27:19,696
You somehow manage to take
care of your mom and sisters.

324
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:21,680
You are making your
brother study MBBS.

325
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:24,709
I had helped you because
I saw your qualities.

326
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,667
Listen, do one thing.

327
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:29,020
You need Rs 1000, right?
- Yes.

328
00:27:29,073 --> 00:27:31,895
I am giving you a
guarantee of Rs 2000.

329
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:34,355
Try somewhere else.
- What are you saying?

330
00:27:34,557 --> 00:27:35,583
I am telling the right thing.

331
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:39,046
Nowadays, money is a
huge problem, dear.

332
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:59,994
What is this, mom?
- Kamla's menstrual cycle has started.

333
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:08,297
What happened, dear?
- Nothing, mom.

334
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:10,925
We have faced so many problems.

335
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:13,360
But I never got scared.

336
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:16,533
But today after learning about
Kamla's menstrual cycle..

337
00:28:16,935 --> 00:28:19,334
..I don't know why I am getting scared.

338
00:28:19,386 --> 00:28:21,126
What are you saying, dear?

339
00:28:21,418 --> 00:28:23,966
Every girl gets her menstrual
cycle after growing up.

340
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:25,482
That's true, mom.

341
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:29,358
Nowadays, a normal girl also
cannot get married easily..

342
00:28:29,555 --> 00:28:31,472
..until a good amount
of dowry is given.

343
00:28:31,892 --> 00:28:35,392
Kamla is poor and dumb as well.

344
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:40,142
From where will we get dowry
for her, whom will we ask...

345
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:45,850
Mom, there are 5 more
girls after her.

346
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,941
Every year one of them will
get their menstrual cycle.

347
00:28:48,406 --> 00:28:51,196
From where will we get...
- Parvati.

348
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:56,635
Shall we go to the market?
- Yes. I was waiting for you. Let's go.

349
00:29:03,164 --> 00:29:06,773
Oh God! The clouds are thundering.

350
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:08,559
I think it will rain heavily today.

351
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,233
Yes, Parvati.
Look, it's getting darker.

352
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,212
Suresh, you need to buy new
clothes and books, right?

353
00:29:16,358 --> 00:29:18,921
If it starts raining,
everything will be wet.

354
00:29:19,073 --> 00:29:22,665
Yes, that's true.
- Let's go tomorrow.

355
00:29:23,097 --> 00:29:25,299
Okay. We'll go tomorrow.

356
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:16,927
Parvati, it's you.
I can't believe it.

357
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,978
Come inside, Parvati.
Mom isn't at home.

358
00:30:20,135 --> 00:30:21,543
She has gone to meet her sister.

359
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:27,636
You are completely drenched.

360
00:30:28,335 --> 00:30:29,558
Here, dry your hair.

361
00:30:30,357 --> 00:30:33,507
What was the need to come alone at
this hour when it's raining outside?

362
00:30:33,723 --> 00:30:35,582
You should've called me,
I would've come.

363
00:30:36,049 --> 00:30:37,542
I don't understand.

364
00:30:37,686 --> 00:30:40,254
What is so important that you
couldn't tell me before?

365
00:30:40,402 --> 00:30:43,214
Or tomorrow morning.
- I was about to come in the evening.

366
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:46,655
But I was thinking whether
I should come or not.

367
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,177
Then I decided that come what may..

368
00:30:49,555 --> 00:30:51,665
..I must meet you.
That's why I am here.

369
00:30:51,747 --> 00:30:53,643
Anyway, what is the matter?

370
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:55,465
Tell me.

371
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:58,700
Don't worry.
Tell me, what is the matter?

372
00:30:59,187 --> 00:31:01,624
Suresh is in his final year.
- Yes.

373
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:04,181
I was supposed to get
money from somewhere.

374
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,917
But I didn't get anything there.

375
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,852
I need Rs 1000 right now.

376
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,260
Can you give me?
- Parvati.

377
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:21,843
What happened?
- I am stone-hearted person.

378
00:31:22,335 --> 00:31:25,855
What are you saying?
- Yes, Parvati. Had that not been true..

379
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,595
..then I would've died
by now for not being..

380
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:31,488
..able to fulfill such a
small demand of yours.

381
00:31:32,035 --> 00:31:33,893
Why are you worried?

382
00:31:34,372 --> 00:31:37,800
It's just me who is asking for it.
No one else.

383
00:31:37,877 --> 00:31:39,561
That's what I feel bad about.

384
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:42,536
The one who never asked
for anything till date..

385
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,187
..she asked me for something
so small out of helplessness..

386
00:31:46,449 --> 00:31:48,004
..and I couldn't fulfill that.

387
00:31:48,215 --> 00:31:52,490
Listen, I knew that you
wouldn't have money.

388
00:31:53,057 --> 00:31:54,427
Yet, I asked you for it.

389
00:31:55,124 --> 00:31:56,259
Do you know why?

390
00:31:57,056 --> 00:32:00,300
If I am unable to fund
Suresh's studies this year..

391
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:03,887
..I won't be sad later..

392
00:32:04,147 --> 00:32:05,801
..that I didn't ask
for money from you.

393
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:08,848
Now I am happy that..

394
00:32:09,151 --> 00:32:11,910
..I tried as much as I could.

395
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,342
That's why I came to you.

396
00:32:15,242 --> 00:32:16,267
Oh my God!

397
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:18,915
You are suddenly asking
for such a huge amount.

398
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:21,361
We have a lot of spending ourselves.

399
00:32:21,864 --> 00:32:26,591
You know that ever since a baby is
born, the doctors, the medicines..

400
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,969
..cost so much and people keep coming.

401
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:31,104
Money is just getting spend.

402
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:33,027
What do I hide from you?

403
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,918
I was worried as to how to pay
your salary of this month.

404
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:41,157
Okay, ma'am. I'll take your leave.

405
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:48,174
I have found such a good groom
that your fate will shine.

406
00:32:48,344 --> 00:32:51,781
His wealth is worth Rs 20,00,000
and hard cash is separate.

407
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:52,999
I am telling the truth.

408
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,608
The thing is that..

409
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,780
..ever since he has seen your
daughter, he wants to marry her.

410
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,807
That's okay.
But didn't a wealthy groom..

411
00:33:01,966 --> 00:33:05,627
..get a girl from a wealthy family?
- You have asked the right question.

412
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,709
This is his second marriage.
- Second marriage?

413
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:12,057
Kids?
- He has 6 of them.

414
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:14,712
What is his age?
- Not much.

415
00:33:14,788 --> 00:33:16,685
He is about 50 years old.

416
00:33:17,113 --> 00:33:19,743
Get up! Get up and leave.

417
00:33:19,795 --> 00:33:23,280
Listen, the person I am
talking to you about..

418
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,894
..at least meet him once.

419
00:33:24,991 --> 00:33:26,161
Enough. I don't want to meet him.

420
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:29,352
Please leave from here.
- I will ask him to come and meet you.

421
00:33:29,403 --> 00:33:30,566
At least meet him once.

422
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:33,356
I have told you that
we aren't interested.

423
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,188
Then why are you insisting?

424
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:36,889
I said, leave right now. Or else...

425
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:38,469
Alright. As you wish.

426
00:33:42,193 --> 00:33:45,139
Please wait. Please come here.

427
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:49,405
The person you were talking about..

428
00:33:49,723 --> 00:33:52,733
..can you help us meet?
- Yes, why not?

429
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:54,927
He is waiting to meet you.

430
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,648
Not to see him.

431
00:33:57,164 --> 00:33:59,423
It is for me to talk to him clearly.

432
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:01,976
Go and tell him and ask him to come.

433
00:34:02,185 --> 00:34:05,430
Don't send him here.
Ask him to come to the temple at 5pm.

434
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:08,049
Parvati, why are you calling him?

435
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:11,720
Why? What's the problem?
- We don't agree to this.

436
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:15,310
Do you think I do?
- Then why are you calling him?

437
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,289
Am I calling him with
a wedding procession?

438
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,557
First, we'll meet and talk.

439
00:34:20,048 --> 00:34:22,110
I'll talk to him about
whatever possible.

440
00:34:22,506 --> 00:34:26,194
If it works and everyone likes him..

441
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,376
..then we'll think about marriage.

442
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:31,489
Parvati, there's nothing
to think about in this.

443
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:32,847
You took the decision!

444
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:35,642
Please go and ask him to come.
- You won't do that.

445
00:34:35,665 --> 00:34:37,989
I am asking you to do so.
- You go inside.

446
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,350
Parvati.
- Go inside.

447
00:34:39,372 --> 00:34:41,093
Parvati, as long as I am alive...
- Enough...

448
00:34:41,406 --> 00:34:43,763
We are outside the house.
Why are you fighting here?

449
00:34:44,043 --> 00:34:46,046
Let's go inside and talk.
- Parvati, even if I die...

450
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:47,431
Suresh!

451
00:34:47,656 --> 00:34:50,465
Are you going inside
or should I leave?

452
00:35:01,992 --> 00:35:05,934
What is it, Parvati? What do
you want to talk to him about?

453
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:07,883
Ask me about it, mom.

454
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,173
I'll tell you what she wants
to talk to him about.

455
00:35:10,196 --> 00:35:13,580
Tell me. - You will be asking
him to help me in my studies.

456
00:35:13,734 --> 00:35:16,786
You will ask him to take care
of your family. Right? - Yes.

457
00:35:17,077 --> 00:35:20,207
That means you are pushing
yourself in to hell.

458
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:23,592
Am I in heaven living
a peaceful life now?

459
00:35:24,828 --> 00:35:26,424
You are right, dear.

460
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:30,333
You never got peace in the
house you were born in.

461
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:34,088
I wish you get peace in your
husband's house at least.

462
00:35:34,553 --> 00:35:37,485
That is what I am saying, mom.
Did you hear?

463
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:41,956
He is a rich man.
- Whatever it is. I won't let this happen.

464
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:44,125
Reason?
- What's his age?

465
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,454
What is your age?
Tell me, what is your age?

466
00:35:49,402 --> 00:35:52,246
Had you got married
at the right time..

467
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,784
..then you would've been a
father of three kids.

468
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:56,880
And I am your elder sister.

469
00:35:57,202 --> 00:35:59,726
Go and get a man of my age.

470
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:01,499
Alright, I will get.

471
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,619
Why are you yelling
without knowing anything?

472
00:36:03,742 --> 00:36:07,137
I am not yelling. I am telling
the truth. I swear I will do it.

473
00:36:07,213 --> 00:36:09,397
First, do it then I will see.

474
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:13,118
Stupid. You are studying in college.

475
00:36:13,448 --> 00:36:18,007
Nowadays, when a 40-year old man
looks at a 20-year old girl, he says..

476
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,221
..that she is way too old.

477
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:22,814
And he thinks he will
get a man of my age.

478
00:36:22,997 --> 00:36:25,465
I am 28 years old right now.

479
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:28,480
Parvati, I am saying
this out of sadness.

480
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:31,630
You are trying to shut
me by saying all this.

481
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:34,960
I beg of you.
This marriage shouldn't happen.

482
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,631
I won't let it happen.

483
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:40,971
Yes, dear. It would be better to stay
alone then get married like this.

484
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:43,887
That's right. Suresh?

485
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,976
Mom is right.
- I see.

486
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,000
I'll stay unmarried then.

487
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:51,142
Let's decide right now.

488
00:36:51,697 --> 00:36:55,129
That means if I get married and go..

489
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:57,288
..then none of you
will be able to eat.

490
00:36:57,734 --> 00:37:01,546
For your comfort, I should keep
working as a maid all my life.

491
00:37:01,731 --> 00:37:04,533
And then one day I will die.

492
00:37:04,882 --> 00:37:08,741
This is what you want.
Fine, I will do this.

493
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,521
What are you saying, Parvati?

494
00:37:10,573 --> 00:37:13,677
When I said that I should leave
my studies and work somewhere..

495
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:17,177
..you refused. You asked me
to study and become a doctor.

496
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:21,487
Now you are accusing me.
- I am making you study. Is it for me?

497
00:37:21,576 --> 00:37:22,601
Then for whom?

498
00:37:23,503 --> 00:37:27,814
Kamla is dumb.
There are more 5 sisters you have.

499
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:31,139
I am making you study so
that they get married..

500
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:35,177
..in a better place.
- But Parvati, even you are my sister.

501
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,840
Do you think I won't
take care of you?

502
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:39,981
God knows whether I
will be alive by then.

503
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:41,921
What are you saying, Parvati?
- Keep quiet.

504
00:37:42,465 --> 00:37:46,805
You think after your studies, people
will come running to you with money.

505
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:51,016
After that you will have to work
hard and make a name for yourself.

506
00:37:51,113 --> 00:37:53,048
Only after that will
your earnings begin.

507
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:55,069
Once you start earning,

508
00:37:55,452 --> 00:37:57,730
God knows if you will
take care of us.

509
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:00,336
Parvati.
- I know there are barely any brothers..

510
00:38:00,485 --> 00:38:02,484
..who take care of their sisters.

511
00:38:02,646 --> 00:38:06,738
After marriage, they take
care of their wife and kids.

512
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,843
Who takes care of their
parents or sisters?

513
00:38:08,865 --> 00:38:11,465
Parvati, I know there
are brothers like that.

514
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:16,169
But their sisters are
not goddesses like you.

515
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:19,552
I just know you and
your sacrifices.

516
00:38:19,746 --> 00:38:22,256
Parvati, after all
I am your brother.

517
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,383
Your feeling of sacrifices
can be in me as well.

518
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:30,791
I see. That's great. So you are
also ready to make sacrifices.

519
00:38:30,843 --> 00:38:32,783
Why not?
- Do you promise?

520
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:38,919
I promise. - Then promise me that
unless you get all your sisters married..

521
00:38:39,155 --> 00:38:40,998
..you won't get married.

522
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,629
I won't promise that
I won't get married.

523
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:47,681
I promise that unless I get
all my sisters married..

524
00:38:47,718 --> 00:38:49,891
..I won't think about getting married.

525
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,917
So, to get these 6 sisters
married in a good family..

526
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:55,879
..you will have to become a doctor
first. - Yes, Parvati.

527
00:38:56,243 --> 00:38:58,998
Then to make you a doctor,
I will have to get married.

528
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:02,052
Parvati. Parvati, we will
find another way for that.

529
00:39:02,168 --> 00:39:03,840
I will complete my studies somehow.

530
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,816
You won't be able to do it, Suresh.
You won't be able to.

531
00:39:05,898 --> 00:39:07,211
Let me try it.

532
00:39:07,293 --> 00:39:10,467
Suresh, you don't understand the
world. This is not possible.

533
00:39:10,538 --> 00:39:13,184
Parvati, what are you talking about?

534
00:39:13,235 --> 00:39:15,185
Alright, forget about the world.

535
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:18,224
Do you know what's the
condition in our house? - What?

536
00:39:18,448 --> 00:39:20,440
The entire house is mortgaged.

537
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:26,201
Suresh, the day you
started studying MBBS..

538
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:28,820
..I had to keep this house mortgage.

539
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:31,904
Did I ever tell you about it?

540
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:35,493
We have faced so many problems.

541
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:38,810
But did I ever show it to you?

542
00:39:39,405 --> 00:39:41,426
Today, I am saying it. Why?

543
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:44,006
Because I have nothing today.

544
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,677
I am completely helpless.

545
00:39:46,957 --> 00:39:49,770
The money lender might
just come someday..

546
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:52,692
..and throw us out of the house.

547
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,349
I think of it and get so afraid.

548
00:39:55,749 --> 00:39:58,022
I met everyone possible.

549
00:39:58,328 --> 00:40:00,957
I asked for money from
everyone possible.

550
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:03,857
I begged everyone I could.

551
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:09,955
But when I saw that there is no other way,
there's nothing we can do..

552
00:40:10,044 --> 00:40:12,668
..that's when I decided to do this.

553
00:40:12,957 --> 00:40:16,778
Go away. Let me be in my situation.

554
00:40:20,536 --> 00:40:21,724
Greetings, sir.

555
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:26,214
Come. I thought you forgot that
there's a case you are fighting.

556
00:40:26,348 --> 00:40:28,494
Why? I keep coming.

557
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:31,737
How will that help? Sit down.

558
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:37,611
Look, your case is very complicated.
Opponent is very strong.

559
00:40:37,845 --> 00:40:42,224
I have left all my work aside and
I am concentrating on your case.

560
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:45,252
You come every time but you
need to pay the fees as well.

561
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:48,283
Last week, I had given you Rs 300.

562
00:40:48,483 --> 00:40:50,609
That's it! Is the case over?

563
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:54,111
Right. I will try to give you more.

564
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:57,519
But please tell me about
the progress of the case.

565
00:40:57,602 --> 00:41:00,825
I have already told you, the
opponent is very strong.

566
00:41:00,985 --> 00:41:02,698
Your side is weak.

567
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:07,027
I will make points and
present it in court.

568
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,448
Whether you win or lose,
it is dependent on that.

569
00:41:09,664 --> 00:41:11,580
Go and arrange for the fees.

570
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:17,183
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

571
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,131
Sir, is his case really weak?

572
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:25,490
Who said?
- You said.

573
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:30,836
Stupid fellow, our case is very strong.
We will surely win.

574
00:41:31,295 --> 00:41:33,392
But after winning the case,

575
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:36,410
I don't want to file a case
on anyone to get my fees.

576
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:37,704
Understood?

577
00:41:45,326 --> 00:41:50,381
So, we have been waiting for the girl since
such a long time. Where is the girl?

578
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:56,558
I had told you that the
girl has called you at 5pm.

579
00:41:56,637 --> 00:41:59,962
But you left home at 3pm
and have been sitting here..

580
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:02,515
..then what can she do
and what can I do.

581
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:05,932
When the girl has a house of her own..

582
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:08,166
..then why did she call
us in the temple?

583
00:42:08,218 --> 00:42:13,779
I think that her brother and mother
don't want this marriage to happen.

584
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,104
Forget about them.
What about the girl?

585
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:20,721
Sir, had she not been interested
why would she call you?

586
00:42:20,773 --> 00:42:22,316
Yes, that's right.

587
00:42:22,552 --> 00:42:24,999
There she is. She has come.
- Go. Go from here.

588
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,126
Wait a moment.

589
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,198
Let me introduce you.
- Come, dear.

590
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:31,736
He is the one who
wants to marry you.

591
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:33,863
I have seen him.
- Right.

592
00:42:33,982 --> 00:42:37,004
We have met each other.
You can leave.

593
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,009
Tell me, what is the matter?

594
00:42:39,662 --> 00:42:42,437
Come. We will speak in
front of God's idol.

595
00:42:42,487 --> 00:42:45,302
Yes, let's go. We will talk here.

596
00:42:48,575 --> 00:42:52,777
What I wish to say is a big thing.
- Surely, tell me.

597
00:42:52,973 --> 00:42:55,927
That's why I wish to keep
someone has witness.

598
00:42:56,005 --> 00:42:59,916
Is it? If you wish, I can get the
richest people of the town here.

599
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,412
That's not needed.

600
00:43:02,268 --> 00:43:08,026
It is better to keep God
as the witness and talk.

601
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:12,642
Of course it is. I am a huge devotee.
I see God in everything.

602
00:43:12,847 --> 00:43:16,882
In the stone, in the wall,
in the pillar, in you and me.

603
00:43:17,075 --> 00:43:19,676
Anyway, forget that.
Tell me, what were you about to say.

604
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:21,527
Tell me, what your demands are.

605
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:25,537
I wish that my brother completes his
final year of studies. - MBBS, right?

606
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:28,453
Yes. He is in his final year.

607
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:34,739
No problem. Even he fails, I will
use my contacts and get him passed.

608
00:43:34,887 --> 00:43:38,500
No. That's not needed.
He is very intelligent.

609
00:43:38,892 --> 00:43:41,421
You can just help with money.

610
00:43:41,805 --> 00:43:43,578
He will surely pass.

611
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:47,495
Alright. I will do it. But he
should be at my house to study.

612
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:49,288
Demand No. 2.

613
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,119
Until he becomes a doctor
and starts earning..

614
00:43:52,613 --> 00:43:56,391
..the responsibility of my
family will be on you.

615
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:58,252
This is what I am sad about.

616
00:43:58,338 --> 00:44:00,579
You are still differentiating.

617
00:44:00,598 --> 00:44:04,328
Both of us are one.
They are my family too.

618
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:08,769
Okay, you will take the
responsibility of our family right?

619
00:44:08,976 --> 00:44:13,616
I swear on God,
on myself and on you.

620
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,439
I will take care of our family.

621
00:44:16,542 --> 00:44:18,918
I too swear on God..

622
00:44:19,379 --> 00:44:23,079
..that I am happily
ready to marry you.

623
00:44:23,378 --> 00:44:26,894
That's great. Take this.

624
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:28,347
Why do I need so much?

625
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:30,124
Rs 1000 is enough.

626
00:44:30,256 --> 00:44:33,129
Keep it. Why are you
counting unnecessarily?

627
00:44:33,365 --> 00:44:34,337
All this is yours.

628
00:44:34,474 --> 00:44:38,141
The keys of the house will be with
you then you can do what you want.

629
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:42,294
One important thing. No one should
know that we are getting married.

630
00:44:43,258 --> 00:44:45,515
Why?
- Well, my mom..

631
00:44:45,615 --> 00:44:49,766
..wants me to get married to someone
else and I don't like those girls.

632
00:44:49,824 --> 00:44:53,142
I really like you. So this
shouldn't be revealed.

633
00:44:53,204 --> 00:44:55,559
If my brother learns about it then..

634
00:44:55,649 --> 00:44:57,816
..he will put a stay
order on the marriage.

635
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,602
We will get married next
Friday here itself.

636
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,933
Okay. I'll take your leave.
- Go on.

637
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:08,211
Parvati.

638
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:22,714
Parvati, you have taken
the right decision.

639
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,746
The ones who have a heart..

640
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,925
..will surely appreciate
your decision.

641
00:45:28,469 --> 00:45:31,925
This is a decision which
tells the whole world..

642
00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:36,455
..that a poor person's heart
doesn't belong to him.

643
00:45:37,582 --> 00:45:39,384
But the poverty belongs to them.

644
00:45:40,268 --> 00:45:44,073
Yes, Parvati.
Today, I have come to the temple.

645
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,220
I have heard your conversation.

646
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:52,084
What do you have to say about it?

647
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:55,639
What can I say? I am sure..

648
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:59,364
..that you do love me..

649
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:02,814
..but you love your family more.

650
00:46:03,902 --> 00:46:05,593
I am telling the truth, Parvati.

651
00:46:06,172 --> 00:46:07,813
I decided yesterday..

652
00:46:08,443 --> 00:46:10,810
..that the two of us can
never get married.

653
00:46:11,389 --> 00:46:14,723
Don't think that I am saying this..

654
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:16,879
..because you are away from me.

655
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,501
I was expecting that I
will get the wealth back.

656
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:26,415
Over this expectation I wanted to take
care of you, your family and Suresh.

657
00:46:26,686 --> 00:46:29,695
But yesterday my lawyer told me..

658
00:46:30,182 --> 00:46:31,936
..that my case is very weak.

659
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,769
I feel I will lose this case.

660
00:46:35,816 --> 00:46:38,012
If I get married to you
in such a situation..

661
00:46:38,344 --> 00:46:40,419
..then it will be a disaster.

662
00:46:41,414 --> 00:46:46,374
Parvati, the sacrifice you made
for your brother and sisters..

663
00:46:46,628 --> 00:46:47,971
..it's a huge sacrifice.

664
00:46:48,536 --> 00:46:51,633
I hope this sacrifice of yours
keeps you in peace always.

665
00:46:52,155 --> 00:46:53,275
I'll take your leave.

666
00:46:54,049 --> 00:46:55,382
Listen.

667
00:46:57,009 --> 00:46:58,611
Will you agree to something I say?

668
00:46:59,087 --> 00:47:04,014
Tell me, Parvati. - You want me
to be happy and in peace.

669
00:47:04,553 --> 00:47:06,163
Then do one thing for me.

670
00:47:07,196 --> 00:47:09,285
You should get married..

671
00:47:09,897 --> 00:47:12,880
..and bring your bride
to visit my house.

672
00:47:14,712 --> 00:47:15,816
I will try.

673
00:47:18,093 --> 00:47:19,499
I will try, Parvati.

674
00:47:37,324 --> 00:47:41,377
Alright. I am married now.
Go and inform my family about it.

675
00:47:43,158 --> 00:47:45,301
Give it to him.
- No, I won't.

676
00:47:45,353 --> 00:47:48,035
You won't! You are very stubborn.
Give it!

677
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:50,802
Take it. Monsters!
- You called me a monster!

678
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,931
Why? Why? Why? Why?

679
00:47:52,983 --> 00:47:54,791
Oh God! The kids are impossible!

680
00:47:54,814 --> 00:47:57,266
Ratan, you are here
at the right time.

681
00:47:57,429 --> 00:47:58,967
Please talk to them.

682
00:47:59,031 --> 00:48:02,277
Mom, kids are mischievous.
Why are you getting mad at them?

683
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:03,851
Are they kids? Really?
- Of course.

684
00:48:04,056 --> 00:48:06,787
Ma'am, what's going on?

685
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:08,399
Are you playing with the kids?

686
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:11,384
I am going crazy and you
think I am playing!

687
00:48:11,466 --> 00:48:14,059
Ma'am, you don't have
to worry at all.

688
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:17,384
After your daughter-in-law comes,
everything will be fine. - What?

689
00:48:17,941 --> 00:48:18,804
What are you saying?

690
00:48:18,856 --> 00:48:22,381
Ma'am, your son's wife will be
your daughter-in-law, right?

691
00:48:22,577 --> 00:48:24,593
What do you mean?
- Hey!

692
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,726
What are you talking about?
Tell me clearly.

693
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,580
Sir, don't you know.

694
00:48:28,603 --> 00:48:31,985
Today in the morning,
Manoharlal got married again.

695
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:33,797
What are you saying?
- When did that happen?

696
00:48:33,855 --> 00:48:35,263
What do we do now, Ratan?

697
00:48:35,502 --> 00:48:38,764
He has made such a huge mistake.
- Wait, mom.

698
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:40,990
Hey, you pigeon.
- I am a man, sir.

699
00:48:41,072 --> 00:48:42,098
I know.

700
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:44,419
What nonsense is this?
- I am telling the truth.

701
00:48:44,514 --> 00:48:48,788
I had heard that your elder brother got
married in the temple in the morning.

702
00:48:49,015 --> 00:48:52,478
You have heard!
- You heard! What is this?

703
00:48:53,275 --> 00:48:56,234
A sweet! That means you were
a part of this wedding.

704
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:58,760
Sir, one should be going to
the wedding of the near ones.

705
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:02,196
So, you got them married.
- Only God takes these decision, sir.

706
00:49:02,277 --> 00:49:04,457
I am just a medium.
- Idiot!

707
00:49:04,551 --> 00:49:06,712
You got the girl.
You got him married.

708
00:49:06,794 --> 00:49:08,316
And now you have come
here to inform us.

709
00:49:08,464 --> 00:49:12,230
Idiot, he is a father of 6 kids.
Why did you have mess his life?

710
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:14,410
A person like you shouldn't
be allowed here.

711
00:49:14,588 --> 00:49:16,744
C'mon! Move! Out! Out!

712
00:49:16,796 --> 00:49:20,629
Get out! Get out!
- I am going! I am going!

713
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:25,104
What is all this, Ratan?
- What a mess this is!

714
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:28,445
Why do you ask me, mom? Has he ever
done anything right till date?

715
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:31,081
Oh God! What do I do now?

716
00:49:31,457 --> 00:49:34,955
These kids are without a mother.
I took care of them.

717
00:49:35,068 --> 00:49:37,590
I have taken such good care of them.

718
00:49:37,612 --> 00:49:42,092
The witch that comes, God knows
how she will treat them.

719
00:49:42,185 --> 00:49:43,987
Grandma, who is coming?

720
00:49:44,033 --> 00:49:46,580
Your step mother is coming.

721
00:49:46,662 --> 00:49:48,980
Step-mom! How will she be?

722
00:49:49,092 --> 00:49:50,363
She will be like a cat.

723
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,214
She will punish you all.

724
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:54,891
She will scare all of you.

725
00:49:56,647 --> 00:49:58,371
There he is!

726
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:05,266
Wait! Where are you going?

727
00:50:06,688 --> 00:50:09,453
Are you deaf? I am talking to you!

728
00:50:09,475 --> 00:50:12,232
Mr. Groom!
- Did you see that? He stopped.

729
00:50:12,484 --> 00:50:14,925
He just got married.
- Hey, cabbie, you shut up.

730
00:50:14,952 --> 00:50:19,478
Why are you shouting at him?
- How dare you get married again?

731
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,619
If you wanted to get married, why
didn't you wait till my death?

732
00:50:23,877 --> 00:50:27,884
Mom, people say that I am
already aged to get married.

733
00:50:27,948 --> 00:50:31,175
Had I waited for you to die,
I would've been more late.

734
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,934
Shameless! It is a sin
to see your face!

735
00:50:35,016 --> 00:50:37,783
We know what is a sin and a deed.
What does he know?

736
00:50:37,858 --> 00:50:40,883
Did you see how my younger
brother talks to me?

737
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:44,598
The kind of things you do being
the elder brother is worth that.

738
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,652
You are a father to 6 kids
and you got married again!

739
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:50,147
Yes, I did that. It's my wish.
You shut up or leave from here.

740
00:50:50,268 --> 00:50:53,654
Who wants to come here anyway?
- Why are standing then? Leave!

741
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,379
I am leaving.
I don't live on your money.

742
00:50:56,491 --> 00:50:58,941
I am capable enough to
take care of myself.

743
00:50:59,054 --> 00:51:00,845
Mom, I'll take your leave.

744
00:51:00,897 --> 00:51:03,232
Ratan. Ratan!
- Let him go.

745
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:05,271
What else can he do?

746
00:51:05,294 --> 00:51:07,498
Who would want to stay
in a sinner's house?

747
00:51:07,581 --> 00:51:09,676
Asha, your sister-in-law is
coming tomorrow morning.

748
00:51:09,749 --> 00:51:11,723
She must be welcomed properly.

749
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:15,666
Mom. - What are you telling me?
I have heard everything.

750
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,892
Grandma, why have these people come?

751
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:29,585
Son, your dad has got
married at this age.

752
00:51:29,645 --> 00:51:31,927
Your step-mom is coming.

753
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,182
We have to welcome her properly.

754
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,134
Why, grandma? You were saying
that she will attack us like a cat.

755
00:51:39,207 --> 00:51:41,210
Is she like that?
- Yes.

756
00:51:41,262 --> 00:51:45,428
You said she will scare us out.
Is she like that?

757
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:48,486
Yes. That's right.
That's how step-mom's are.

758
00:51:48,687 --> 00:51:53,047
Listen kids, if you tried to
do be mischievous with her..

759
00:51:53,129 --> 00:51:59,171
..the way you are with me then she
will throw you out within no time.

760
00:51:59,253 --> 00:52:00,666
Be careful.

761
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:03,319
Asha, listen to me carefully.

762
00:52:03,564 --> 00:52:07,518
The second wife is always thinking..

763
00:52:07,831 --> 00:52:10,861
..about her targets to
fight and argue with.

764
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,637
Don't give her a chance.

765
00:52:12,779 --> 00:52:16,954
If the two of you have an
argument then you are loss.

766
00:52:17,873 --> 00:52:19,736
I think she has come. Go on.

767
00:52:46,505 --> 00:52:47,786
Be happy.

768
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,696
Parvati, what are you looking at?

769
00:53:03,023 --> 00:53:05,128
I heard he has 6 kids.

770
00:53:05,689 --> 00:53:07,589
I am unable to see any of them.

771
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,428
Greetings. Do you work her as a maid?
- Yes.

772
00:53:47,694 --> 00:53:50,383
These things are in such a mess.

773
00:53:50,822 --> 00:53:53,388
Don't you think we should clear it?
- Yes.

774
00:53:55,754 --> 00:53:56,937
Please keep it there.

775
00:54:17,511 --> 00:54:18,470
Hey.

776
00:54:20,029 --> 00:54:23,014
She is our step-mom.
She will beat us up.

777
00:54:27,357 --> 00:54:30,091
What's so great about it?
She is smiling!

778
00:54:33,836 --> 00:54:36,365
Oh God! These kids!

779
00:54:53,437 --> 00:54:54,718
Oh no!

780
00:55:10,537 --> 00:55:14,944
Oh! That's not the way you should make
a child drink milk, she might choke.

781
00:55:15,483 --> 00:55:19,957
The head should always be up
while making her drink milk.

782
00:55:29,372 --> 00:55:32,756
Here you go. Make her sleep now.

783
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:34,841
C'mon, let's go and make you sleep.

784
00:55:39,228 --> 00:55:44,805
No. No. Don't cry. Go to sleep.
Sleep. No.

785
00:55:44,827 --> 00:55:47,098
If you make her sleep like this,
she won't sleep.

786
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:49,637
If you sing a lullaby,
she will sleep quickly.

787
00:55:49,675 --> 00:55:52,420
Parvati, I don't know any lullaby.

788
00:55:53,575 --> 00:55:55,975
Do women need to learn a lullaby?

789
00:55:57,327 --> 00:55:58,869
The life of a woman..

790
00:55:59,801 --> 00:56:01,327
..itself is a lullaby.

791
00:56:02,671 --> 00:56:10,118
"Go to sleep, my dear girl."

792
00:56:10,783 --> 00:56:16,645
"Why sacrifice your sleep?"

793
00:56:17,602 --> 00:56:24,457
"After this phase of childhood
is gone.."

794
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:31,018
"..a woman doesn't sleep all her life."

795
00:56:47,209 --> 00:56:57,982
"A woman's life is like a swing,
at this end and at that end."

796
00:56:59,689 --> 00:57:09,366
"A woman's life is like a swing,
at this end and at that end."

797
00:57:09,525 --> 00:57:19,098
"Sometimes there's smile on her face,
sometimes tears rolling down her eyes."

798
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:29,561
"A woman's life is like a swing,
at this end and at that end."

799
00:57:52,408 --> 00:57:57,368
"She gives such a lot
of peace to the world."

800
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:02,582
"She does that being a mother,
a sister and a wife."

801
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:11,213
"She gives such a lot
of peace to the world."

802
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:16,016
"She does that being a mother,
a sister and a wife."

803
00:58:16,115 --> 00:58:20,726
"Her life is a difficult one."

804
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:25,947
"The society has never
understood this."

805
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,142
Parvati.

806
00:59:54,061 --> 00:59:56,614
Look, Grandma said the right thing.

807
00:59:56,851 --> 00:59:59,681
Step-mom is going to
scare us with that.

808
00:59:59,824 --> 01:00:03,989
Oh God! Run! Run!
- Run! Run!

809
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:09,215
Oh God! What is wrong with you!

810
01:00:09,269 --> 01:00:12,735
All of you are such a mess.
You are always troubling me.

811
01:00:12,967 --> 01:00:17,155
Just wait and watch.
I won't spare you.

812
01:00:17,773 --> 01:00:22,543
They have become very mischievous.
I won't spare them today.

813
01:00:24,805 --> 01:00:27,554
Wait! Where are you going?

814
01:00:27,854 --> 01:00:30,547
C'mon! Come here!

815
01:00:30,983 --> 01:00:34,736
Sit down all of you. Sit down!

816
01:00:34,818 --> 01:00:36,407
Mother! Mother!

817
01:00:36,677 --> 01:00:39,862
What are you doing? Leave it.
What is this?

818
01:00:40,622 --> 01:00:42,897
What if they are hurt with this?

819
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:44,931
You come here. Come here.

820
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:49,694
Do you think I will
hurt them with this?

821
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:52,750
I was just trying to scare them.

822
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:56,413
With a burning wood stick!
There are other ways to scare also.

823
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,556
You don't know this
mischievous bunch.

824
01:00:58,667 --> 01:01:00,762
They are so stubborn,
they won't listen.

825
01:01:00,844 --> 01:01:05,418
That's alright, mother. But please
don't show them the burning stick.

826
01:01:05,853 --> 01:01:08,466
They are raw mud.

827
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:11,121
The way we mold them,
they will take that shape.

828
01:01:11,736 --> 01:01:13,421
Is this the right way to scare them?

829
01:01:13,522 --> 01:01:15,158
Well, it isn't right.

830
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,957
Then you take care
of them from now on.

831
01:01:18,032 --> 01:01:20,079
I won't come in between.

832
01:01:20,161 --> 01:01:21,355
I am going.

833
01:01:23,048 --> 01:01:25,093
Go. Go and play.

834
01:01:26,176 --> 01:01:27,384
Munni.

835
01:01:28,663 --> 01:01:32,503
Hey, this step-mom is really nice.
She won't scare us.

836
01:01:32,627 --> 01:01:34,929
Grandma lied to us.

837
01:01:34,981 --> 01:01:38,199
Come. Let's go and ask her.
- Yes, let's go.

838
01:01:39,508 --> 01:01:41,382
Come. Come here.

839
01:01:43,376 --> 01:01:44,776
Why are you standing there?

840
01:01:45,751 --> 01:01:46,892
What do you want?

841
01:01:46,957 --> 01:01:48,954
We'll tell you, step-mom.

842
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,920
Don't call me that. Call me 'mom'.

843
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:55,150
Mom, will you scare us like a cat?

844
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:59,791
What?
- No, son, I will never hurt you.

845
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:02,995
Will you hurt us with
a burning stick?

846
01:02:03,102 --> 01:02:07,817
Why do you say so? When grandma was
showing the stick, I snatched it.

847
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,490
Hey, listen.

848
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:11,947
Alright. Now go and play. Go.

849
01:02:13,714 --> 01:02:15,595
We hate!
- Grandma!

850
01:02:15,677 --> 01:02:17,377
We hate!
- Grandma!

851
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,088
We hate!
- Grandma!

852
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:21,856
Dear Lord! What's wrong
with all of you?

853
01:02:21,979 --> 01:02:23,786
Why do you hate me?

854
01:02:23,884 --> 01:02:27,991
Grandma, you lied to us that
mom is hurt us like a cat.

855
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:31,290
Mom is really nice. She loves us.
You are a witch.

856
01:02:31,384 --> 01:02:35,555
You hurt us like a cat.
You scared us with a burning stick.

857
01:02:35,632 --> 01:02:38,538
Come. Let's beat her up.

858
01:02:40,283 --> 01:02:44,437
Hey! Stop it! - What is all this?
You are beating up your grandma!

859
01:02:44,626 --> 01:02:46,302
This is wrong. Why did you do this?

860
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:51,261
What happened, mother?
- Parvati, before you came..

861
01:02:51,409 --> 01:02:54,588
..I had told them something about you.
- What did you say?

862
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:59,160
Usually, step-moms
are bad in nature.

863
01:02:59,407 --> 01:03:03,599
So I told them that you
will hurt them like cats..

864
01:03:03,705 --> 01:03:05,496
..and scare you with a burning stick.

865
01:03:05,664 --> 01:03:08,782
Ever since you have come,
they are observing you.

866
01:03:08,864 --> 01:03:11,998
They love you a lot.
They were saying..

867
01:03:12,078 --> 01:03:14,864
..that you are really
nice and I am witch.

868
01:03:14,946 --> 01:03:18,848
All of them love you a lot, Parvati.

869
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,229
Mom.
- Mom.

870
01:03:26,943 --> 01:03:29,838
Kamla, how are you? Where is mom?

871
01:03:33,478 --> 01:03:37,451
Suresh. Suresh. It's you.
- Mom.

872
01:03:39,197 --> 01:03:42,434
Is Parvati alright?
- Yes, mom. She is absolutely fine.

873
01:03:42,612 --> 01:03:45,926
The kids, her mother-in-law,
all of them love her a lot.

874
01:03:47,382 --> 01:03:50,117
I want to meet Parvati.

875
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,057
Please get her here once.

876
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:58,160
Yes, mom. I will get her.
She also wants to come.

877
01:03:58,625 --> 01:04:00,943
But Manoharlal's nature
is a bit strange.

878
01:04:01,444 --> 01:04:04,589
He might not like it
if she comes here.

879
01:04:04,702 --> 01:04:06,175
Then let it be, son.

880
01:04:06,526 --> 01:04:09,410
We are happy that
she is happy there.

881
01:04:10,544 --> 01:04:12,999
What about her Asha and Ratanlal?

882
01:04:13,211 --> 01:04:16,304
Asha is good. But I don't
know anything about Ratanlal.

883
01:04:16,455 --> 01:04:19,426
He never comes home and I
haven't seen him either.

884
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:20,916
Kamla, where are others?

885
01:04:23,003 --> 01:04:25,520
Have they gone to school?
Alright, mom. I'll leave.

886
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:27,730
I am getting late for college.
- Yes, son.

887
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:30,223
Go carefully.
- Yes, mom.

888
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:39,497
I will apply first.
- No, I will.

889
01:04:39,753 --> 01:04:42,460
Enough. Don't fight.
Everyone will take a good bath.

890
01:04:56,661 --> 01:04:59,390
Asha, you continue.
I'll be right back.

891
01:05:02,796 --> 01:05:03,961
Did you call me?

892
01:05:04,924 --> 01:05:06,975
What are you doing?
- Oh c'mon!

893
01:05:07,283 --> 01:05:10,268
Leave me. Didn't you see the
kids are shouting there?

894
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:12,454
Soap has entered
their eyes and ears.

895
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:15,674
Let them shout. How are we bothered?
- What is wrong with you?

896
01:05:15,762 --> 01:05:18,350
Your younger sister is
standing there and you...

897
01:05:25,983 --> 01:05:28,909
I won't be able to come tomorrow.
Don't wait for me.

898
01:05:29,378 --> 01:05:32,570
Asha!
- Ratan!

899
01:05:35,491 --> 01:05:38,458
Take a look. I sold that cab and
I have taken a new private cab.

900
01:05:38,548 --> 01:05:41,332
I just have to give Rs 200 every month.
- That's okay, Ratan.

901
01:05:41,451 --> 01:05:42,837
But why don't you come home?

902
01:05:43,246 --> 01:05:46,846
You are having a fight with Manohar.
What have we done?

903
01:05:47,019 --> 01:05:49,813
At least come once in
a week to meet us.

904
01:05:49,893 --> 01:05:52,009
Why should I? First, I saw
Manohar do atrocities.

905
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:54,997
Now you want me to come and see
our sister-in-law do atrocities.

906
01:05:55,047 --> 01:05:57,252
Atrocities! Who told you so?

907
01:05:57,434 --> 01:05:58,712
What's there to say?

908
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:00,975
She is step-mom.
She is bound to do so.

909
01:06:01,074 --> 01:06:03,314
You are saying things
without knowing the truth.

910
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,384
Come home and see. I swear, Ratan.

911
01:06:06,461 --> 01:06:10,034
We have got such a good sister-in-law
that no one can imagine.

912
01:06:10,226 --> 01:06:11,793
Really, Asha?
- Yes, Ratan.

913
01:06:11,921 --> 01:06:14,607
Oh! That means I don't
have to worry anymore.

914
01:06:15,673 --> 01:06:20,156
The bell is ringing. You should go.
I will come in meet soon. - Okay.

915
01:06:25,323 --> 01:06:28,048
Parvati, there is a prayer
session in the temple.

916
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,720
Mom is asking me to
go along with her.

917
01:06:29,934 --> 01:06:31,195
Can I go?
- Of course.

918
01:06:31,647 --> 01:06:34,601
Should I take the car? - But the car
is out since morning, Asha.

919
01:06:34,738 --> 01:06:37,461
Alright, no problem. It's nearby.
We'll go walking.

920
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,530
Come back soon.
- Sure, Parvati.

921
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:49,681
"From the town of sleep, the angels.."

922
01:06:50,181 --> 01:06:55,097
"..have got a bag full of dreams."

923
01:06:56,967 --> 01:07:02,375
"The stars are also feeling sleepy.."

924
01:07:02,979 --> 01:07:09,084
"..when the moon came up the sky."

925
01:07:14,379 --> 01:07:20,523
"As the night has come up.."

926
01:07:21,205 --> 01:07:27,450
"..the entire world is sleeping."

927
01:07:27,964 --> 01:07:34,416
"You too, my dearest daughter.."

928
01:07:34,807 --> 01:07:41,567
"..close your eyes and enter
the land of dreams."

929
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:44,498
I am asking you to come.

930
01:07:46,256 --> 01:07:48,542
Oh c'mon! Just come.

931
01:07:48,601 --> 01:07:52,412
"How do I come.."

932
01:07:52,765 --> 01:07:57,533
"..unless my dearest daughter.."

933
01:07:58,082 --> 01:08:02,869
"..falls fast asleep."

934
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:09,981
"Keep patience and don't be wild."

935
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:16,889
"What is this impatience all about?"

936
01:08:39,038 --> 01:08:40,424
Oh!

937
01:08:43,057 --> 01:08:47,312
What's the hurry? Didn't I tell you,
I am coming after making Munni sleep.

938
01:08:47,353 --> 01:08:50,548
Munni will keep crying all night.
I will go crazy by then.

939
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:52,889
What?
- What are you doing?

940
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,001
Alright. Go out. Get out.
- No.

941
01:09:03,758 --> 01:09:04,899
Why are you turning the lights off?

942
01:09:05,448 --> 01:09:07,988
Is this important?
- Yes, I am scared.

943
01:09:08,087 --> 01:09:09,503
No.
- Go out! Go!

944
01:09:09,549 --> 01:09:10,962
Alright. Let it be.

945
01:09:28,779 --> 01:09:31,725
Look, Munni is crying.

946
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:37,056
I think she is coming
upstairs looking for me.

947
01:09:43,601 --> 01:09:45,520
Leave me! Leave me!
- No.

948
01:09:45,587 --> 01:09:48,110
Leave me! Munni might
fall of the stairs. - No!

949
01:09:48,157 --> 01:09:51,275
Let her fall off!
- How can you do that?

950
01:09:53,421 --> 01:09:56,559
Munni! My daughter! Oh dear!

951
01:09:56,875 --> 01:09:58,698
Oh Munni! My dear!

952
01:09:58,756 --> 01:10:00,201
Were you looking for me?

953
01:10:05,718 --> 01:10:09,321
What can we do? Her fate is such!

954
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:13,388
Oh God! Such a good wife..

955
01:10:13,511 --> 01:10:15,330
..for such a bad man!

956
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:29,821
Hand over Munni to Asha and come
with me. Did you hear me?

957
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,919
Who is the cab driver here?

958
01:10:47,933 --> 01:10:49,641
Driver!
- Yes?

959
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:51,106
I need to go to Hotel Grand.
Will you?

960
01:10:52,273 --> 01:10:55,397
C'mon, sit. Hurry up.

961
01:10:57,434 --> 01:10:58,685
Let's go.

962
01:11:09,437 --> 01:11:12,118
C'mon, get off.
- Where have you got me?

963
01:11:12,195 --> 01:11:16,557
Hotel. - What is this? Why would we
leave the house in stay in a hotel?

964
01:11:16,616 --> 01:11:19,283
The kids have irritated
in the house.

965
01:11:19,452 --> 01:11:22,173
Are we able to sit in peace
at home for a while?

966
01:11:22,324 --> 01:11:24,454
Someone asks for food,
someone for milk.

967
01:11:24,536 --> 01:11:25,702
I don't like all this.

968
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:27,388
Get off.
- What are you saying?

969
01:11:27,919 --> 01:11:32,695
Around those kids, we are able to
see each other, that's enough.

970
01:11:32,994 --> 01:11:36,435
In between their shouts, we are
able to talk to each other.

971
01:11:36,776 --> 01:11:38,115
That's what family is about.

972
01:11:38,198 --> 01:11:39,850
Are you trying to teach
me about family?

973
01:11:39,999 --> 01:11:42,931
Get off right now.
- No. I am scared.

974
01:11:43,013 --> 01:11:45,833
Why are you scared?
Your husband is with you.

975
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:47,167
That's why I am scared.

976
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:50,444
When people see us here, will
they think you are my husband?

977
01:11:50,948 --> 01:11:52,448
Why are you talking about others?

978
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,825
I myself considered
you wrong, Parvati.

979
01:11:55,092 --> 01:11:57,976
You know me?
- Yes, Parvati. I am Ratan.

980
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:02,018
But I am unfortunate to have not
been able to meet you till date.

981
01:12:02,823 --> 01:12:06,889
I am sure you know by now that
my brother is strange man.

982
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:09,909
He has a great wife like
you yet he hasn't changed.

983
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:11,441
Hey, shut up!

984
01:12:11,513 --> 01:12:14,126
Don't shout. You are elder
to me that's why I am quiet.

985
01:12:14,209 --> 01:12:18,119
Else, I would've thrown you out
of the cab within no time.

986
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:19,509
Let's go.
- No, Parvati.

987
01:12:19,591 --> 01:12:23,269
Let's go. - Manohar, if you force her
I will shout and call out to people.

988
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:24,593
Stay there, Parvati.

989
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:39,564
Come, Parvati. Go inside.

990
01:12:41,451 --> 01:12:44,976
Manohar, we are lucky to have her.

991
01:12:45,228 --> 01:12:46,591
Make sure she isn't sad.

992
01:12:46,672 --> 01:12:49,881
Go. Go!
- I am going. But I will keep coming.

993
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:52,620
You will keep coming!
This is such a pain!

994
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:55,119
Kids irritate me at home
and my brother outside.

995
01:12:56,296 --> 01:12:58,820
Parvati.
- Yes?

996
01:12:58,842 --> 01:13:00,562
Tomorrow morning we will
go to Mussorie - Mussorie?

997
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:01,700
Yes, be ready.

998
01:13:01,772 --> 01:13:03,338
But...
- I said, be ready

999
01:13:03,616 --> 01:13:04,642
Okay.

1000
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:13,640
Now will you come?
- I am coming, one minute.

1001
01:13:13,953 --> 01:13:15,545
If you don't come by
one minute then...

1002
01:13:15,771 --> 01:13:20,584
The almighty has granted such a beautiful
face, why do you need make-up?

1003
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:22,899
We have reach Mussorie by night.
But she isn't leaving.

1004
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:26,656
C'mon! Let's go.
- Yes! Yeah! We are going.

1005
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:29,110
All of us are going!
- Yes, all us are going.

1006
01:13:29,185 --> 01:13:30,858
Go and sit in the car.

1007
01:13:33,346 --> 01:13:34,372
Hey.

1008
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:37,105
Come here.

1009
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:38,977
What did I tell you?

1010
01:13:39,534 --> 01:13:41,361
You said, we'll be
going to Mussorie.

1011
01:13:41,429 --> 01:13:43,731
What does that mean?
- What does it mean?

1012
01:13:43,828 --> 01:13:46,833
I meant, we will be able to
leave peacefully for some days.

1013
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:48,678
So, I had said only the
two of us will be going.

1014
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,144
When did I say that the
kids will come along?

1015
01:13:51,197 --> 01:13:52,680
Just the two of us?
- Yes.

1016
01:13:53,403 --> 01:13:56,310
What is so funny?
- Nothing.

1017
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:59,322
But what so interesting in
Mussorie and Shimla at this age?

1018
01:13:59,705 --> 01:14:01,247
Are you coming alone or not?

1019
01:14:01,553 --> 01:14:05,000
Listen, it's my mistake that
I asked them to come along.

1020
01:14:05,214 --> 01:14:08,088
But now I have told them,
let them come along.

1021
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:11,555
Hey!
- Listen, if we leave them alone now..

1022
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:13,280
..then they will be really sad.

1023
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:14,749
Is that so?

1024
01:14:14,771 --> 01:14:18,456
Alright. Then no one will go.
Now no one will go to Mussorie.

1025
01:14:18,603 --> 01:14:22,800
I am married to you and
hence I can't do anywhere.

1026
01:14:22,865 --> 01:14:24,845
But I will surely go
the cremation ground.- Listen.

1027
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:26,007
I don't want to.

1028
01:14:32,850 --> 01:14:34,486
Parvati, please come here.

1029
01:14:34,538 --> 01:14:36,710
What is it, Asha?
- Please come.

1030
01:14:39,844 --> 01:14:43,346
Parvati, listen to me.
Go with him alone.

1031
01:14:43,424 --> 01:14:46,024
What? What are you saying?

1032
01:14:46,136 --> 01:14:48,079
I have a reason to say so.

1033
01:14:49,309 --> 01:14:51,617
Mom, let's go.
- Let's go!

1034
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,393
Wait! I am coming.

1035
01:14:53,934 --> 01:14:56,907
Look at them.
How can I go without them?

1036
01:14:57,005 --> 01:14:59,604
Parvati, don't get me wrong.

1037
01:14:59,906 --> 01:15:02,994
You have come home just now.
Before you came..

1038
01:15:03,092 --> 01:15:05,140
..I took care of them.

1039
01:15:05,904 --> 01:15:08,258
You don't know how Manohar is.

1040
01:15:08,339 --> 01:15:10,836
How will I know?
- I'll tell you.

1041
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:14,984
A sister shouldn't say all
this about her own brother.

1042
01:15:15,078 --> 01:15:17,125
But I have to say this
because of these kids.

1043
01:15:17,865 --> 01:15:19,713
He is very stubborn, Parvati.

1044
01:15:20,081 --> 01:15:24,056
Because of his attitude,
my first sister-in-law died.

1045
01:15:24,891 --> 01:15:26,558
A kid every year.

1046
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:31,013
If my brother doesn't get what
he wants at that very moment..

1047
01:15:31,035 --> 01:15:33,344
..then he creates a ruckus.

1048
01:15:33,496 --> 01:15:35,730
He will start breaking things.

1049
01:15:36,134 --> 01:15:38,905
He picks up things and
throws them on the kids.

1050
01:15:39,629 --> 01:15:44,594
Do you want him to hit the kids?
- No. I didn't know all this.

1051
01:15:44,658 --> 01:15:47,840
I will go right now. But, Asha..

1052
01:15:48,272 --> 01:15:49,825
..take care of the kids.

1053
01:15:50,204 --> 01:15:53,636
If there's a problem then
call them that very moment. - Okay.

1054
01:15:54,795 --> 01:15:57,107
Parvati, go from this side.

1055
01:15:57,234 --> 01:15:59,688
Let me make an excuse and
take the kids upstairs.

1056
01:15:59,998 --> 01:16:01,461
Go with Manohar.

1057
01:16:16,115 --> 01:16:18,459
Listen, I have handled
the situation.

1058
01:16:18,889 --> 01:16:22,325
We'll take the kids some other time.
Today, we'll go together.

1059
01:16:22,754 --> 01:16:25,787
Had you said this before,
I would've been happier.

1060
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:29,147
It's not too late.
Here, wear your coat.

1061
01:16:30,756 --> 01:16:35,459
I asked you to come to Mussorie
with me, there's a reason.

1062
01:16:35,499 --> 01:16:37,636
Unless you come along how
will you understand.

1063
01:16:37,841 --> 01:16:41,696
Now I am coming. I will understand.
- Let's go.

1064
01:16:54,998 --> 01:16:56,512
Yes, Manoharlal speaking.

1065
01:16:56,704 --> 01:16:58,843
Hello, Mr. Malhotra here.

1066
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,921
Hello, Mr. Malhotra. How are you?

1067
01:17:00,968 --> 01:17:03,836
Everyone is waiting
for you at the party.

1068
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:05,099
You haven't come here yet!

1069
01:17:05,239 --> 01:17:07,491
Good very good.
I am leaving in 5 minutes.

1070
01:17:07,576 --> 01:17:09,026
C'mon! Hurry up!

1071
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:12,122
Parvati, hurry up. Quick.

1072
01:17:14,374 --> 01:17:16,843
Let's go.
- How long...

1073
01:17:21,691 --> 01:17:24,428
Hey! What is this you are wearing?

1074
01:17:24,594 --> 01:17:26,552
Are you feeling cold?

1075
01:17:26,617 --> 01:17:29,850
You have covered your
whole body, idiot!

1076
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:31,902
Do you know the kind of
place we are going to?

1077
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:33,876
It is not any ordinary
man who has invited me.

1078
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:37,039
He has a science degree from
England's Oxford University.

1079
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,974
He has traveled all over the world.

1080
01:17:39,049 --> 01:17:41,367
England, France, America.

1081
01:17:41,443 --> 01:17:44,444
He called me as a
gentleman with my wife.

1082
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:49,004
How can you come with these clothes?
You illiterate, woman!

1083
01:17:49,067 --> 01:17:51,229
Go and cut grasses in some field.

1084
01:17:51,355 --> 01:17:55,242
What can I do? I don't know how to
dress up the way you want me to.

1085
01:17:55,457 --> 01:17:58,577
I know you don't know that.
How will you know?

1086
01:17:58,747 --> 01:18:00,503
You are always inside the house.

1087
01:18:00,584 --> 01:18:04,445
You are always with the kids or
in the kitchen. How will you know..

1088
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,564
..about modern fashion like this?

1089
01:18:06,671 --> 01:18:10,225
That's why I used to ask you to come
and watch English films with me.

1090
01:18:10,344 --> 01:18:12,493
They are such amazing movies.

1091
01:18:12,684 --> 01:18:16,175
'Woman By Night', 'Paris By Night',
'World By Night."

1092
01:18:16,216 --> 01:18:18,482
The story is just like
the name of the film.

1093
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:22,903
Had you seen one movie, you would've
transformed by now. Shameless

1094
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:25,366
Why did you wear a sari?

1095
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:27,702
Why didn't you wear the
dress I bought for you?

1096
01:18:28,026 --> 01:18:29,801
What is this? Is this the
way to do your hair?

1097
01:18:30,003 --> 01:18:32,051
I had asked you to dress
your hair properly.

1098
01:18:32,087 --> 01:18:34,494
You applied oil in your
hair and combed it.

1099
01:18:34,689 --> 01:18:37,884
Modern hair dressing
should be like a bee-hive.

1100
01:18:37,967 --> 01:18:40,300
It should be like a Saint Narayana.

1101
01:18:40,409 --> 01:18:44,290
Why didn't you do that? Why didn't
you apply nail polish to the nails?

1102
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:46,743
You won't change.
I will dress hence forth.

1103
01:18:46,782 --> 01:18:50,732
Let it be.
- No way. People will laugh. Let's go.

1104
01:18:53,427 --> 01:18:55,191
Just a minute.

1105
01:18:56,271 --> 01:18:58,944
Don't move. Don't move. That's it.

1106
01:19:01,891 --> 01:19:04,736
Get up. C'mon. Look at you.

1107
01:19:04,804 --> 01:19:07,585
You look like a woman from Paris.

1108
01:19:07,673 --> 01:19:11,279
Oh God! What is this nonsense?
What have I done? This looks horrible.

1109
01:19:11,316 --> 01:19:14,161
Is it bad? You will have to come
like this.- No. I won't.

1110
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:16,450
Why not?
- Let me wear something over it.

1111
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:18,502
No, no. You won't wear
anything over it.

1112
01:19:18,657 --> 01:19:20,173
Then I won't come.

1113
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,289
Oh God! This is such a pain!

1114
01:19:23,094 --> 01:19:25,391
You are messing with the
beauty of this dress. Take it.

1115
01:19:25,559 --> 01:19:27,314
What is this? Is this a cloth?

1116
01:19:27,425 --> 01:19:29,147
Why not?
- This is like a net.

1117
01:19:29,259 --> 01:19:30,526
Give me something else.

1118
01:19:31,077 --> 01:19:34,882
You will have to wear this. Women these
days wear these kind of clothes.

1119
01:19:34,905 --> 01:19:36,223
Let's go. And listen.

1120
01:19:36,423 --> 01:19:38,067
Do you know what you
have to go there and do?

1121
01:19:38,182 --> 01:19:39,645
What?
- We will go there.

1122
01:19:40,021 --> 01:19:41,942
Rich people will be around.
- So what?

1123
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,440
People from high
societies will be there.

1124
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:48,655
As you reach there shake hands
with them and greet them. - What?

1125
01:19:48,879 --> 01:19:50,966
I have to shake hands
with unknown men. No way!

1126
01:19:51,065 --> 01:19:53,307
Dear Lord! You are such an illiterate!

1127
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,047
If you don't do that
they will laugh at me.

1128
01:19:56,141 --> 01:19:59,291
As soon as we reach
there, forget about me.

1129
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,835
Don't look at me.

1130
01:20:01,342 --> 01:20:04,388
Just greet them and shake hands.
Show it to me.

1131
01:20:05,072 --> 01:20:08,493
Hello!
- What is this? Are you crying?

1132
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:10,261
Just say. 'Hello.'
- Hello.

1133
01:20:10,413 --> 01:20:11,933
Now let's go.

1134
01:20:13,248 --> 01:20:14,465
Be careful.

1135
01:20:14,489 --> 01:20:16,738
Nonsense! Get up.

1136
01:20:18,974 --> 01:20:21,319
What sort of shoes are these?
Such big heels.

1137
01:20:21,448 --> 01:20:22,754
Can I hold them in
my hands and walk?

1138
01:20:22,864 --> 01:20:28,119
Why don't you place it on your head?
Walk for a while, you'll get used to it.

1139
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:31,464
Great. C'mon. Good.

1140
01:20:33,342 --> 01:20:34,697
Come, Manoharlal, come.

1141
01:20:35,005 --> 01:20:36,967
You are so late.
- I am sorry.

1142
01:20:37,003 --> 01:20:42,209
That's alright. So you have got your
daughter along. - No. She is my wife.

1143
01:20:42,283 --> 01:20:43,680
Second wife.
- Really?

1144
01:20:43,695 --> 01:20:46,431
Nice meeting you.
- Shake hands with him.

1145
01:20:46,513 --> 01:20:48,227
Hello.
- Waiter!

1146
01:20:49,759 --> 01:20:51,873
Take it.
- Thank you.

1147
01:20:52,127 --> 01:20:53,736
Please take your seat.
- Thank you.

1148
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:58,604
Sit. Sit down.

1149
01:21:00,543 --> 01:21:02,079
Hey, what are you doing?

1150
01:21:04,399 --> 01:21:08,258
Mr. James, sorry for the delay.
- Oh! Don't worry.

1151
01:21:08,466 --> 01:21:10,560
Ladies and gentlemen,
take your partners.

1152
01:21:42,206 --> 01:21:43,987
Come, let's dance.

1153
01:21:44,309 --> 01:21:46,441
Oh God! What is this?
- Why?

1154
01:21:46,623 --> 01:21:48,760
I don't know all this.
- What don't you know?

1155
01:21:48,827 --> 01:21:52,724
Just bend a bit and get up.
It's so easy. Everyone is doing it.

1156
01:21:52,834 --> 01:21:56,991
I don't know how to dance.
- I will kill you. Just dance.

1157
01:21:57,013 --> 01:21:58,296
I beg of you.

1158
01:21:58,318 --> 01:22:01,501
No need. Just shake your legs.
C'mon.

1159
01:23:52,191 --> 01:23:58,843
"I am in love with you.."

1160
01:23:59,449 --> 01:24:05,855
"..but I won't be able to tell you."

1161
01:24:05,897 --> 01:24:15,996
"I am in love with you but I
will not be able to tell you."

1162
01:24:16,029 --> 01:24:20,673
"There is a smile on my lips.."

1163
01:24:20,738 --> 01:24:25,844
"..but I won't be able to tell you."

1164
01:24:25,895 --> 01:24:31,380
"I am in love with you but I
will not be able to tell you."

1165
01:24:53,236 --> 01:25:03,331
"Sometimes I am happy, I have desires,
my heart beats pace and I am confused."

1166
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:13,513
"My heart is in a strange condition
but I am unable to say it."

1167
01:25:13,573 --> 01:25:18,709
"I am in love with you."

1168
01:25:33,581 --> 01:25:43,822
"You are waiting to hear about
the condition of my heart."

1169
01:25:48,552 --> 01:25:58,488
"You are waiting to hear about
the condition of my heart."

1170
01:25:58,601 --> 01:26:08,507
"I have the time to tell you
everything but I unable to say it."

1171
01:26:08,633 --> 01:26:14,336
"I am in love with you."

1172
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:39,918
Mom.

1173
01:26:40,743 --> 01:26:41,960
What is it?

1174
01:26:42,085 --> 01:26:43,848
Well... Well...

1175
01:26:44,062 --> 01:26:46,196
Well... What?

1176
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:50,633
Suresh has gone and sat at the
dining area. Shouldn't you serve him?

1177
01:26:51,048 --> 01:26:55,096
Why you asking me? Go and serve him.

1178
01:26:55,132 --> 01:26:57,394
No, I am really scared.

1179
01:26:57,450 --> 01:27:00,230
You are scared!
You are scared of that boy!

1180
01:27:00,438 --> 01:27:04,182
He quietly comes and leave quietly.

1181
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:06,618
He doesn't even look at anyone.

1182
01:27:06,725 --> 01:27:09,446
Go on. He might feel bad.

1183
01:27:09,497 --> 01:27:13,793
What is this, mom?
- Go. Why are you afraid?

1184
01:27:14,251 --> 01:27:15,965
What nonsense? Go on.

1185
01:27:16,678 --> 01:27:18,622
She thinks he will eat her up.

1186
01:27:31,183 --> 01:27:32,526
Shall I serve you?

1187
01:27:33,905 --> 01:27:35,624
It's you.
- Yes.

1188
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:38,733
Can't I serve you?
- No, that's not what I meant.

1189
01:27:38,761 --> 01:27:40,276
But your mom always...

1190
01:27:40,329 --> 01:27:42,729
Okay. I'll send her then.

1191
01:27:42,852 --> 01:27:44,877
No, that's not what I meant.

1192
01:27:52,024 --> 01:27:55,106
Little bit rice and a bit of yoghurt.
- Is that it?

1193
01:28:05,585 --> 01:28:07,976
That's enough.
- Hey.

1194
01:28:08,461 --> 01:28:12,187
If you eat so less, you will become
a patient instead of a doctor.

1195
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:26,036
Pickle.

1196
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:32,714
Why not? I thought I will
give you if you ask for it. - Is it?

1197
01:29:11,099 --> 01:29:12,672
Oh God! the lights are out.

1198
01:29:12,730 --> 01:29:14,829
So what? I am with you. Don't worry.

1199
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:17,204
Oh God! Asha!

1200
01:29:17,501 --> 01:29:21,703
What happened, mom?
- What is this? The lights are out!

1201
01:29:21,743 --> 01:29:26,060
Yes, mom. - Be careful.
Don't fall off in the dark.

1202
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:28,320
Oh God! It's so dark.

1203
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:30,715
I am unable to find the matchsticks.
What do I do?

1204
01:29:30,737 --> 01:29:33,303
Ask her not to come here.
It's dark, she'll fall off.

1205
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:37,212
Mom, don't come here
else you will fall off.

1206
01:29:38,486 --> 01:29:40,120
The lights are back.

1207
01:29:44,974 --> 01:29:47,735
Asha.
- What is it?

1208
01:29:51,694 --> 01:29:53,612
Come here.
- Asha!

1209
01:29:53,921 --> 01:29:55,717
I am coming.

1210
01:29:57,202 --> 01:29:58,302
What is it?

1211
01:29:59,017 --> 01:30:01,201
This.
- Oh no!

1212
01:30:09,526 --> 01:30:10,613
Listen.

1213
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:15,838
Now what is it?
- I'll tell you. See this.

1214
01:30:19,462 --> 01:30:24,367
Munni is crying. Please go.
I am coming. Please go. - Alright.

1215
01:30:24,582 --> 01:30:26,153
Keep quiet.

1216
01:30:26,261 --> 01:30:29,205
No. No. Don't cry, dear.

1217
01:30:29,362 --> 01:30:32,041
Quiet. Good kids don't cry.

1218
01:30:32,075 --> 01:30:35,322
Mother, why is she crying?
- I don't know, son.

1219
01:30:35,387 --> 01:30:38,666
She suddenly woke up
and started crying.

1220
01:30:38,819 --> 01:30:41,480
Asha, come fast. What are you doing?

1221
01:30:41,589 --> 01:30:44,642
Oh God!
- No, dear Munni. No.

1222
01:30:44,714 --> 01:30:49,185
How hit you? No, dear. Don't cry.

1223
01:30:49,994 --> 01:30:52,327
Give her to me. Let me try.

1224
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,282
No. No.

1225
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:17,752
Quiet, dear. Quiet.

1226
01:31:22,746 --> 01:31:29,639
Quiet, dear. C'mon. Quiet.
- Quiet.

1227
01:31:30,802 --> 01:31:35,027
Take her. - Mother, I don't know if
her stomach is aching or something.

1228
01:31:35,072 --> 01:31:36,455
She is continuously crying.

1229
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:39,612
Should I call the doctor?
- Go, son. Get him.

1230
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:43,619
Get him soon.
- No, dear. No darling. Oh no!

1231
01:31:50,532 --> 01:31:54,288
Suresh! Suresh! Come back. Come here.

1232
01:31:54,816 --> 01:31:58,383
What happened?
- There's no need to get a doctor.

1233
01:31:58,444 --> 01:32:00,778
Look where she is going.

1234
01:32:19,076 --> 01:32:20,669
Did you understand
what the matter is?

1235
01:32:20,897 --> 01:32:22,583
She is missing her mom.

1236
01:32:22,782 --> 01:32:25,657
Oh God! Now we won't be
able to take care of her.

1237
01:32:25,895 --> 01:32:28,535
Send a telegram to Parvati
immediately and ask her to come.

1238
01:32:28,589 --> 01:32:30,942
Send her a telegram in my name.
- Okay.

1239
01:32:32,423 --> 01:32:33,778
Your telegram!

1240
01:32:41,634 --> 01:32:44,611
Nonsense! They will never
let us live peacefully.

1241
01:32:56,384 --> 01:32:58,198
I threw the telegram.
Why did you pick it up?

1242
01:32:58,279 --> 01:32:59,613
Yes, it's my mistake. Now let's go.

1243
01:32:59,756 --> 01:33:00,888
Where?
- Home.

1244
01:33:01,017 --> 01:33:02,850
Why?
- What's written in the telegram.

1245
01:33:02,896 --> 01:33:05,354
That Munni is crying.
- Asha has sent the telegram.

1246
01:33:05,574 --> 01:33:07,177
So what?

1247
01:33:07,919 --> 01:33:09,301
She has asked us to come.

1248
01:33:09,407 --> 01:33:11,857
Had it not been serious, she
wouldn't had sent the telegram.

1249
01:33:11,882 --> 01:33:16,888
Let it be. - If something happens
to her if we don't reach on time.

1250
01:33:16,910 --> 01:33:18,767
There are doctors there.
They will take care.

1251
01:33:18,836 --> 01:33:20,909
I have come to Mussorie,
I won't go back so soon.

1252
01:33:21,116 --> 01:33:24,480
You may do as you want. I won't
stay here anymore. I am going.

1253
01:33:24,583 --> 01:33:26,989
I see. So, this is the situation.

1254
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:28,791
Listen.
- Yes?

1255
01:33:28,943 --> 01:33:31,245
I have a provision.
- Go ahead.

1256
01:33:31,267 --> 01:33:33,097
Our luggage will be here.
- It will.

1257
01:33:33,179 --> 01:33:35,560
We will go and see.
- Alright.

1258
01:33:35,646 --> 01:33:37,260
If Munni is fine...
- If she is fine.

1259
01:33:37,312 --> 01:33:39,373
We will come back soon.
- Yes. We will. Hurry up.

1260
01:33:39,433 --> 01:33:42,604
We will come back soon or else this
beautiful season will pass off.

1261
01:33:43,685 --> 01:33:46,601
God knows what sort of
hill station and what season.

1262
01:33:51,845 --> 01:33:56,374
Okay. Have this, dear.
Have it. Good girl.

1263
01:33:57,486 --> 01:33:58,788
Hey!

1264
01:34:00,006 --> 01:34:03,407
Look at her. She is so irritated.

1265
01:34:03,719 --> 01:34:06,786
Driver, hurry up.

1266
01:34:07,157 --> 01:34:11,426
God knows if Parvati received the
telegram. She hasn't come back yet.

1267
01:34:11,514 --> 01:34:14,462
What do we do? I don't understand.

1268
01:34:14,493 --> 01:34:15,733
Keep quiet, dear.

1269
01:34:17,223 --> 01:34:20,690
Look, Munni. Your mom has come.

1270
01:34:21,368 --> 01:34:24,616
Mom! Mom! Mom!

1271
01:34:31,861 --> 01:34:34,813
Mom is back. C'mon!
- Mom! Mom!

1272
01:34:35,106 --> 01:34:38,510
Mom, you went away without us.

1273
01:35:20,059 --> 01:35:24,398
The cycle is stuck. It's stuck.
Help me.

1274
01:35:36,407 --> 01:35:38,615
Oh no! Sorry!

1275
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:21,006
"You ignited love in me and fire
in my heart, now don't leave me."

1276
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:28,296
"I am always yours but I was quiet
as I was shy, now tell me."

1277
01:36:28,378 --> 01:36:35,647
"You ignited love in me and fire
in my heart, now don't leave me."

1278
01:36:35,681 --> 01:36:42,936
"I am always yours but I was quiet
as I was shy, now tell me."

1279
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:08,104
"A lover has come across your way."

1280
01:37:08,194 --> 01:37:13,554
"I wish to stay in your
arms all my life."

1281
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:20,381
"A lover has come across your way."

1282
01:37:20,463 --> 01:37:25,320
"I wish to stay in your
arms all my life."

1283
01:37:25,384 --> 01:37:30,198
"The days are beautiful,
it is a season of love."

1284
01:37:30,231 --> 01:37:37,715
"Tell me what is the plan of
his majesty... Of his majesty."

1285
01:37:37,820 --> 01:37:45,046
"You ignited love in me and fire
in my heart, now don't leave me."

1286
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:52,283
"I am always yours but I was quiet
as I was shy, now tell me."

1287
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:19,710
"Don't put the pressure
of love on your heart."

1288
01:38:19,744 --> 01:38:25,232
"Your youthfulness is cruel,
take care of yourself."

1289
01:38:27,047 --> 01:38:31,955
"Don't put the pressure
of love on your heart."

1290
01:38:31,977 --> 01:38:36,792
"Your youthfulness is cruel,
take care of yourself."

1291
01:38:36,819 --> 01:38:41,446
"All of this is because
of the fun in love."

1292
01:38:41,487 --> 01:38:48,976
"You are in my eyes, hence I am not in
my senses. I am not in my senses."

1293
01:38:48,998 --> 01:38:56,314
"You ignited love in me and fire
in my heart, now don't leave me."

1294
01:38:56,418 --> 01:39:03,423
"I am always yours but I was quiet
as I was shy, now tell me."

1295
01:39:03,468 --> 01:39:10,885
"You ignited love in me and fire
in my heart, now don't leave me."

1296
01:39:10,915 --> 01:39:18,735
"I am always yours but I was quiet
as I was shy, now tell me."

1297
01:40:05,768 --> 01:40:07,027
Why did you call me?

1298
01:40:09,853 --> 01:40:11,107
Why did you call me?

1299
01:40:12,807 --> 01:40:18,809
Hey, I am asking you why
have you called me here?

1300
01:40:19,021 --> 01:40:20,126
Come with me.

1301
01:40:24,539 --> 01:40:28,775
Asha.
- First, tell me why did you call me?

1302
01:40:29,775 --> 01:40:31,461
Listen.
- Yes?

1303
01:40:31,875 --> 01:40:34,596
I want...
- What do you want?

1304
01:40:34,878 --> 01:40:37,350
I want you to be close to me.
- And?

1305
01:40:37,733 --> 01:40:39,745
I wish to keep seeing
you all the time.

1306
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:42,455
Always?
- Yes, Asha.

1307
01:40:43,216 --> 01:40:47,170
Since some days I feel that if I
don't see you for even a minute,

1308
01:40:47,544 --> 01:40:49,073
I will go crazy.

1309
01:40:50,003 --> 01:40:52,062
You will go crazy if
you don't see me!

1310
01:40:53,852 --> 01:40:57,454
I am going crazy just
thinking about you.

1311
01:40:57,728 --> 01:41:00,087
Really?
- Yes.

1312
01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:01,346
Asha!

1313
01:41:03,194 --> 01:41:04,859
Idiot! How dare you!

1314
01:41:05,381 --> 01:41:06,723
Manohar!
- Move aside!

1315
01:41:07,699 --> 01:41:10,847
How dare you do that?
Get out of here!

1316
01:41:16,199 --> 01:41:18,788
Why are you standing here?
Leave! Leave from here!

1317
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:22,152
I will break your bones!
- Shut up! Go inside!

1318
01:41:22,636 --> 01:41:23,896
You are here already.

1319
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:27,179
Did you get your brother
to study here..

1320
01:41:27,201 --> 01:41:30,944
..or was it for him to fall in love my
sister and capture all my wealth?

1321
01:41:31,293 --> 01:41:35,371
Have you seen his actions?
He is studying with my money!

1322
01:41:35,393 --> 01:41:37,167
And he is having an
affair with my sister!

1323
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:41,377
Idiot! Insolent man! Leave from here!
Go away!

1324
01:41:41,398 --> 01:41:43,713
How dare you! I will kill you!

1325
01:41:43,765 --> 01:41:47,325
Get out! I was helping
you in your studies.

1326
01:41:47,426 --> 01:41:50,752
Now you won't study!
You won't get a single penny.

1327
01:41:50,834 --> 01:41:53,635
If you ever come back,
I will kill you.

1328
01:41:53,701 --> 01:41:54,869
Get out!

1329
01:42:33,118 --> 01:42:37,728
Listen, I am sure something is wrong
because of which he did this.

1330
01:42:37,911 --> 01:42:39,968
I didn't know anything about it.

1331
01:42:40,726 --> 01:42:43,663
I am shocked that he
went to such an extent.

1332
01:42:44,461 --> 01:42:46,648
But now I take the responsibility.

1333
01:42:46,778 --> 01:42:49,059
I promise you.
Nothing will happen in the future.

1334
01:42:50,544 --> 01:42:52,590
Please forgive him this time.

1335
01:42:52,930 --> 01:42:56,140
Hey! What do you think
about yourself?

1336
01:42:56,163 --> 01:42:58,239
You shared your point of view
and now you are leaving.

1337
01:42:58,584 --> 01:43:01,525
What he has done...
- It isn't a small thing.

1338
01:43:01,692 --> 01:43:03,685
I agree he did a very wrong thing.

1339
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:07,625
Is that enough? I am not ready
to listen to anything about it.

1340
01:43:07,678 --> 01:43:09,948
First, I want him out of this house.

1341
01:43:10,045 --> 01:43:11,735
I'll ask him to leave right now.

1342
01:43:11,787 --> 01:43:14,593
Yes, ask him to leave
and then come here.

1343
01:43:14,724 --> 01:43:16,220
I'll throw him out of the house.

1344
01:43:17,435 --> 01:43:19,214
Please don't stop his studies.

1345
01:43:19,297 --> 01:43:20,859
Why? Why not?

1346
01:43:21,265 --> 01:43:22,899
His studies are not for him.

1347
01:43:23,196 --> 01:43:27,299
It's for the betterment
of my other 6 sisters.

1348
01:43:27,434 --> 01:43:29,365
But he never thought of it.

1349
01:43:29,450 --> 01:43:31,767
Had he thought about it, he
wouldn't have done this.

1350
01:43:32,013 --> 01:43:34,663
You won't say a word to
your brother, will you?

1351
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:36,663
Instead you are speaking to me.

1352
01:43:36,685 --> 01:43:38,135
Go from here!

1353
01:43:38,218 --> 01:43:43,488
I completely agree.
What my brother did was wrong.

1354
01:43:43,687 --> 01:43:47,750
He deserved more punishment
than what you gave him.

1355
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,183
I'll get him to you right now.

1356
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:52,656
Beat him up black and blue.

1357
01:43:52,755 --> 01:43:54,775
But please don't stop his studies.

1358
01:43:55,112 --> 01:43:56,742
I beg of you.

1359
01:43:56,802 --> 01:44:01,030
You know my attitude.
I will do what I say.

1360
01:44:01,127 --> 01:44:03,345
I am not used to go
back on my words.

1361
01:44:03,927 --> 01:44:07,380
Even I know that you won't
go back on your words.

1362
01:44:08,018 --> 01:44:10,550
You promised me that you will
fund his final year studies.

1363
01:44:10,677 --> 01:44:14,013
That too inside a temple.
Not just an ordinary place.

1364
01:44:14,095 --> 01:44:18,205
Yes, I did what I said. I have
been funding his studies.

1365
01:44:18,286 --> 01:44:20,075
I have taken care of
your family members.

1366
01:44:20,186 --> 01:44:24,056
But are you treating me the
way you are supposed to?

1367
01:44:25,165 --> 01:44:27,212
What are you saying?

1368
01:44:27,415 --> 01:44:29,327
What haven't I done?
- What have you done?

1369
01:44:29,487 --> 01:44:32,683
What haven't I done?
- Don't you know how to treat me?

1370
01:44:32,705 --> 01:44:35,913
What are you saying? First, tell me..

1371
01:44:35,985 --> 01:44:37,659
..what is my fault?

1372
01:44:37,952 --> 01:44:39,873
So that I don't repeat my mistakes.

1373
01:44:39,966 --> 01:44:42,078
Hey! You are my wife. Right?

1374
01:44:42,930 --> 01:44:47,387
Have you ever told me that its 10 pm..

1375
01:44:47,482 --> 01:44:49,800
..and I am standing
outside in the cold.

1376
01:44:49,852 --> 01:44:53,118
Have you asked me to come inside,
have some milk and fruits.

1377
01:44:53,157 --> 01:44:55,031
I feel like choking you to death.

1378
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:58,643
I keep coming to you.

1379
01:44:58,668 --> 01:45:01,748
But you always go back in the reverse
gear thinking about the kids.

1380
01:45:01,826 --> 01:45:03,764
I know everything.

1381
01:45:04,135 --> 01:45:07,618
What do you mean?
- I know that you don't like me.

1382
01:45:07,823 --> 01:45:10,014
Wow! You are a great actor!

1383
01:45:10,237 --> 01:45:12,590
Did you get married
because you liked me?

1384
01:45:12,703 --> 01:45:16,358
I am a rich man. You married
me because of my wealth.

1385
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:18,472
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have touched me either.

1386
01:45:18,627 --> 01:45:21,845
You are always with the kids
because you think you love them.

1387
01:45:21,952 --> 01:45:24,823
Do you really love them?
No need to cheat us.

1388
01:45:25,618 --> 01:45:29,403
Today, you came close to me but
this never happened before.

1389
01:45:29,471 --> 01:45:31,138
Today, you want to make sure
your brother keeps studying..

1390
01:45:31,221 --> 01:45:34,165
..that's why you are touching me.
Get lost!

1391
01:45:36,146 --> 01:45:40,999
Listen, you said that I
don't treat you the way..

1392
01:45:41,185 --> 01:45:45,378
you expect me to do.
I agree this might be true.

1393
01:45:45,844 --> 01:45:49,667
But this is because of my innocence.
Nothing else.

1394
01:45:50,307 --> 01:45:53,912
But when you say that I
don't love your kids.

1395
01:45:54,173 --> 01:45:55,896
That's not true. It's wrong.

1396
01:45:55,977 --> 01:45:59,155
What is wrong?
Do you really love these kids?

1397
01:45:59,177 --> 01:46:01,058
You are being pretentious.

1398
01:46:01,893 --> 01:46:04,294
No point in acting like crying. Go!

1399
01:46:04,365 --> 01:46:08,040
What about this studies?
- Don't talk to me about it. Go!

1400
01:46:08,063 --> 01:46:10,742
I have 6 helpless sisters.
One of them is dumb.

1401
01:46:10,763 --> 01:46:13,329
I don't care. Go! Get out!

1402
01:46:35,983 --> 01:46:40,570
Why did you do this? Do you remember,
you had promised me something?

1403
01:46:40,893 --> 01:46:43,921
Unless you get all
your sisters married..

1404
01:46:44,222 --> 01:46:47,060
..you won't think about your marriage.

1405
01:46:47,406 --> 01:46:50,579
Today, you forgot everything
because of a girl.

1406
01:46:50,857 --> 01:46:53,394
You forgot your promise!

1407
01:46:53,897 --> 01:46:57,224
Had I not got married to him
after listening to you..

1408
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:00,558
..do you know what we might
have to go through?

1409
01:47:00,895 --> 01:47:04,663
We would've been out of our house,
the entire city would laugh at us.

1410
01:47:04,801 --> 01:47:05,827
Look at me.

1411
01:47:06,267 --> 01:47:09,106
Had you been concerned
about you dumb sister..

1412
01:47:09,409 --> 01:47:12,306
..would you be able to look at Asha?

1413
01:47:13,744 --> 01:47:17,667
What's the point of crying now?
He has asked you to leave.

1414
01:47:18,146 --> 01:47:21,540
I cannot keep you here
against his wishes.

1415
01:47:21,736 --> 01:47:23,039
Go away.

1416
01:47:26,228 --> 01:47:27,484
Listen.

1417
01:47:30,243 --> 01:47:35,125
If you have a bit of shame
then fulfill your promise.

1418
01:47:35,349 --> 01:47:38,190
Go and arrange for the money yourself.

1419
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:41,449
Somehow, complete your
studies and become a doctor.

1420
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:45,686
Until then if she
remains single for you..

1421
01:47:46,013 --> 01:47:48,969
..then come back as a
doctor in this house..

1422
01:47:49,399 --> 01:47:52,740
..and ask her from him officially.

1423
01:47:53,288 --> 01:47:57,204
Even then if he doesn't agree,
I will take care of everything else.

1424
01:47:57,431 --> 01:47:58,952
Now go away.

1425
01:48:43,866 --> 01:48:53,770
"A woman's life is like a swing,
at this end and at that end."

1426
01:48:53,836 --> 01:49:03,322
"A woman's life is like a swing,
at this end and at that end."

1427
01:49:03,372 --> 01:49:12,713
"Sometimes there's smile on her face,
sometimes tears rolling down her eyes."

1428
01:49:12,907 --> 01:49:23,604
"A woman's life is like a swing,
at this end and at that end."

1429
01:49:29,087 --> 01:49:33,496
Suresh! Come, son.
Didn't you go to college today?

1430
01:49:33,797 --> 01:49:37,530
No, mom. I thought of
meeting all of you.

1431
01:49:37,601 --> 01:49:40,116
Kamla, look Suresh has come.

1432
01:49:41,865 --> 01:49:44,642
Son, wait I'll get some tea for you.

1433
01:50:04,093 --> 01:50:05,692
Take it, son.

1434
01:50:07,853 --> 01:50:11,093
Suresh, may God always
bless Manoharlal.

1435
01:50:11,651 --> 01:50:15,562
He sends money every month,
we manage with it.

1436
01:50:16,532 --> 01:50:19,822
Please ask him to send this
month's money today itself.

1437
01:50:20,654 --> 01:50:23,205
Why, mom?
- There are no grains in the house.

1438
01:50:24,184 --> 01:50:25,967
How do I hide anything from you?

1439
01:50:26,091 --> 01:50:29,934
Your sisters haven't eaten
anything since yesterday.

1440
01:50:34,882 --> 01:50:35,937
What happened, son?

1441
01:50:36,939 --> 01:50:38,064
Nothing, mom.

1442
01:51:17,738 --> 01:51:19,364
There's no one to help me push it.

1443
01:51:19,767 --> 01:51:23,365
I think the government has solved
the problem of unemployment.

1444
01:51:23,816 --> 01:51:26,528
Alright. I think I
will have to push it.

1445
01:51:29,462 --> 01:51:31,431
What are you doing?
- Pushing the car.

1446
01:51:31,498 --> 01:51:33,298
Really? I hope you aren't
trying to steal anything.

1447
01:51:33,397 --> 01:51:35,945
No. I am pushing the car.
- I see that.

1448
01:51:36,196 --> 01:51:38,873
Thank you very much.
The petrol is over.

1449
01:51:38,941 --> 01:51:41,139
We'll have to take it
till the petrol pump.

1450
01:51:41,262 --> 01:51:42,851
You seem to be decent man.

1451
01:51:44,690 --> 01:51:46,268
Alright. Stop.

1452
01:51:48,445 --> 01:51:50,887
Hey, put 10 liter of petrol.

1453
01:51:51,575 --> 01:51:52,658
Come here.

1454
01:51:54,789 --> 01:51:56,178
Take this.
- What's this?

1455
01:51:56,228 --> 01:52:00,387
No one would pay anything for
pushing the car. I paid Rs 2 to you.

1456
01:52:00,650 --> 01:52:03,573
Do you know why? Because
you helped me voluntarily.

1457
01:52:03,627 --> 01:52:06,137
And you want more money.
- That's not what I meant.

1458
01:52:06,523 --> 01:52:09,309
I am desperately roaming around
to earn this Rs 2 since morning.

1459
01:52:09,625 --> 01:52:12,694
But I didn't know that I will
be able to earn it so soon.

1460
01:52:13,010 --> 01:52:14,458
My family is dying of hunger.

1461
01:52:14,486 --> 01:52:16,627
If you roam about in these
clothes all around the city

1462
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:18,397
then the family is bound
to die of hunger.

1463
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:22,532
That's not true. We had
trusted on a rich man's word.

1464
01:52:22,792 --> 01:52:24,239
That's why we are suffering.

1465
01:52:24,428 --> 01:52:25,512
Listen.

1466
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:26,923
If you don't mind,
can I say something?

1467
01:52:26,977 --> 01:52:29,223
If you say something good then
why would I mind. Say it.

1468
01:52:29,716 --> 01:52:32,318
Please help me get a job.
- Job? Me?

1469
01:52:32,534 --> 01:52:34,096
How can I get you a job?

1470
01:52:34,402 --> 01:52:36,495
You seem to be an educated person.

1471
01:52:36,788 --> 01:52:40,760
Until I get a good job,
keep me as a cleaner.

1472
01:52:40,812 --> 01:52:42,034
Cleaner?

1473
01:52:47,996 --> 01:52:49,430
Will you be able to do it?
- Absolutely!

1474
01:52:49,925 --> 01:52:52,558
Alright. You will get Rs 3 everyday.
Agreed? - Agreed.

1475
01:52:52,773 --> 01:52:54,518
Come tomorrow.
- Listen.

1476
01:52:54,618 --> 01:52:56,845
Now what?
- Where's your garage?

1477
01:52:56,905 --> 01:53:00,572
You are strange. Even if you
ask an animal in the city..

1478
01:53:00,655 --> 01:53:03,855
..where the garage of a rich man's
brother, Ratanlal cab driver..

1479
01:53:03,907 --> 01:53:06,000
..they will tell you. Go on.

1480
01:53:06,614 --> 01:53:11,234
Kamla, Vimla, Shanta...
I have got food. - Suresh! Suresh!

1481
01:53:11,291 --> 01:53:12,869
Kamla, take this. Feed them.

1482
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:16,312
Kamla. Kamla.
- You too have some.

1483
01:53:16,394 --> 01:53:18,623
Go slow. Don't shout.

1484
01:53:18,765 --> 01:53:21,157
What is the matter?
- Mom, I have got a job.

1485
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:24,382
Job? What job?
- I will tell that later.

1486
01:53:24,506 --> 01:53:26,625
First, take this money, go and
get some rice and lentils.

1487
01:53:27,387 --> 01:53:29,699
I have had, Kamla. Give it to mom.

1488
01:53:29,885 --> 01:53:31,007
Keep it there, dear.

1489
01:53:31,682 --> 01:53:35,125
Mom, I am telling something.
Always remember it.

1490
01:53:35,621 --> 01:53:37,907
A man is the one who eats whatever
he gets out of hard work.

1491
01:53:38,281 --> 01:53:41,243
The one who wants to live
on someone else's money..

1492
01:53:41,495 --> 01:53:44,436
..suffers just like our
family is suffering.

1493
01:53:44,657 --> 01:53:47,038
This is my experience, mom.
I am telling the truth.

1494
01:53:48,391 --> 01:53:51,715
Take it.
- Right. You used to sit ideal here.

1495
01:53:51,761 --> 01:53:54,318
Now you are earning because
of us, so you are being rude.

1496
01:53:54,417 --> 01:53:57,340
Enough, man. How much will
you clean? Go and rest.

1497
01:53:57,360 --> 01:54:00,730
I don't need to take rest.
- At least my cab needs to rest.

1498
01:54:00,811 --> 01:54:03,613
You are cleaning as if
your washing vessels.

1499
01:54:03,695 --> 01:54:08,211
Elderly people have said, one should
work a bit and rest a bit as well.

1500
01:54:12,856 --> 01:54:15,423
When you start, you
don't seem to stop.

1501
01:54:28,217 --> 01:54:30,450
Hello, who are you?

1502
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:31,788
I am Suresh here.

1503
01:54:31,922 --> 01:54:34,920
Uncle Suresh. I am Vinod.

1504
01:54:35,025 --> 01:54:37,269
Vinod, is dad home?

1505
01:54:37,368 --> 01:54:40,132
Yes, he is.
- Will you help me with something?

1506
01:54:40,291 --> 01:54:41,743
Sure. Tell me.

1507
01:54:42,043 --> 01:54:44,629
Make sure your dad
doesn't know about it.

1508
01:54:44,882 --> 01:54:47,621
Quietly go and get Asha on the line.

1509
01:54:47,927 --> 01:54:52,595
Uncle, if aunt comes here
dad will learn about it.

1510
01:54:52,729 --> 01:54:55,197
She is inside the room studying.

1511
01:54:55,413 --> 01:54:57,360
I'll take the telephone to her room.

1512
01:54:57,383 --> 01:55:00,960
Okay. You are very smart.
Go and give it.

1513
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:14,218
Hey, why are you getting
the telephone here?

1514
01:55:15,778 --> 01:55:18,460
Uncle Suresh, wants to talk to you.

1515
01:55:22,783 --> 01:55:24,835
Hello, Asha here.

1516
01:55:24,962 --> 01:55:27,753
Suresh here. How are you, Asha?

1517
01:55:29,222 --> 01:55:31,315
Asha, why are you crying?

1518
01:55:33,461 --> 01:55:34,689
Tell me.

1519
01:55:35,226 --> 01:55:38,111
Suresh, I hope you won't forget me.

1520
01:55:38,229 --> 01:55:39,634
What are you saying, Asha?

1521
01:55:40,103 --> 01:55:43,205
If you were away from me then
I would've forgotten you.

1522
01:55:43,632 --> 01:55:45,334
But now we are one.

1523
01:55:45,533 --> 01:55:46,953
How can I forget you?

1524
01:55:52,239 --> 01:55:55,749
Is this guy speaking on
the phone or cleaning it?

1525
01:55:56,413 --> 01:55:59,959
Asha, how is Parvati?
- What can I say?

1526
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:02,554
Parvati, keeps crying all day.

1527
01:56:03,449 --> 01:56:06,083
Complete your studies
anyhow, Suresh.

1528
01:56:06,135 --> 01:56:08,468
I came out from there with the
idea of completing my studies.

1529
01:56:08,731 --> 01:56:11,816
But Asha, my family members
are in a bad condition.

1530
01:56:12,001 --> 01:56:13,986
I can't even think about studying.

1531
01:56:14,038 --> 01:56:16,658
No. What are you saying?

1532
01:56:16,782 --> 01:56:20,506
Yes, Asha. Your brother, Manoharlal
is responsible for that.

1533
01:56:22,653 --> 01:56:24,414
Asha. Manoharlal.

1534
01:56:24,748 --> 01:56:26,139
My brother and sister.

1535
01:56:26,946 --> 01:56:27,873
Who is he?

1536
01:56:28,008 --> 01:56:31,593
They used to send money to our house,
now they have stopped it.

1537
01:56:32,470 --> 01:56:34,445
The condition of the
house is very bad Asha..

1538
01:56:34,935 --> 01:56:36,863
..but with effort I got a small job.

1539
01:56:37,706 --> 01:56:41,192
Whatever I earn,
I somehow manage to support my family.

1540
01:56:41,686 --> 01:56:44,676
But Asha I will try to
complete my studies.

1541
01:56:44,973 --> 01:56:48,326
Asha, I will call you
at this time every day.

1542
01:56:48,581 --> 01:56:51,507
And I will wait for your
call every day at this time.

1543
01:56:53,195 --> 01:56:54,938
Hello?
- Hello?

1544
01:56:55,018 --> 01:56:55,850
Who are you? Hello?

1545
01:56:55,974 --> 01:56:58,650
Idiot!
- I am Ratanlal. Not idiot!

1546
01:56:58,685 --> 01:57:01,487
Ratan! Was Asha speaking
to you all this while?

1547
01:57:01,652 --> 01:57:03,702
Yes, she was talking to me.
Who else?

1548
01:57:03,807 --> 01:57:07,090
Donkey! When you have left home,
why do you have to call?

1549
01:57:07,166 --> 01:57:11,588
Donkey's elder brother, if you can
talk properly to me then it's okay.

1550
01:57:11,726 --> 01:57:14,443
If you want me to talk like you..

1551
01:57:14,564 --> 01:57:16,056
..then I will talk to
you when I meet you.

1552
01:57:16,175 --> 01:57:17,465
I am cutting the call.

1553
01:57:21,833 --> 01:57:23,892
So, that's what you are doing.
Come out.

1554
01:57:24,344 --> 01:57:26,392
Look, don't get me wrong.

1555
01:57:26,471 --> 01:57:28,886
The girl I was talking
to is a relative.

1556
01:57:28,974 --> 01:57:30,364
Relative. What do you mean?

1557
01:57:30,417 --> 01:57:31,841
She is my brother-in-law's
younger sister.

1558
01:57:31,952 --> 01:57:33,454
Brother-in-law? What do you mean?

1559
01:57:33,556 --> 01:57:35,893
My sister's husband.
I was talking to his sister.

1560
01:57:36,045 --> 01:57:38,721
Since how many days is
this affair going on?

1561
01:57:38,803 --> 01:57:40,971
Well, I...
- Alright. Don't tell me.

1562
01:57:41,036 --> 01:57:45,833
Tell me one thing. If you face problems
and troubles, will you still be with her?

1563
01:57:45,933 --> 01:57:48,450
Even if I die...
- You will take her along.

1564
01:57:48,473 --> 01:57:49,780
I think so.

1565
01:57:49,911 --> 01:57:52,438
Does the girl feel the same way?
- Both of us feel the same way.

1566
01:57:52,522 --> 01:57:54,165
Now listen to what I have to say.

1567
01:57:54,321 --> 01:57:57,125
Stand here. Don't move.
Put your hands down.

1568
01:57:57,747 --> 01:57:58,868
Wait, I am coming.

1569
01:58:01,148 --> 01:58:04,371
Oh God! I think I will lose my job.

1570
01:58:28,757 --> 01:58:31,898
So, is she the relative you
were talking about. - Yes.

1571
01:58:32,072 --> 01:58:34,209
Is she your brother-in-law's sister?

1572
01:58:35,186 --> 01:58:37,848
Yes. Do you know who
your brother-in-law is?

1573
01:58:38,478 --> 01:58:40,185
Speak up.
- Who is he?

1574
01:58:40,297 --> 01:58:41,718
He is my elder brother.

1575
01:58:42,754 --> 01:58:45,374
Asha.
- Yes, Suresh. He is my brother.

1576
01:58:45,576 --> 01:58:49,079
That's great. You spoke
to her in front of me.

1577
01:58:49,141 --> 01:58:52,762
Ratan. - Quiet. Nowadays,
lovers speak over the phone..

1578
01:58:52,858 --> 01:58:54,261
..for such a long time.

1579
01:58:54,641 --> 01:58:57,812
I am telling the two of you.
If you want to talk to each other..

1580
01:58:57,937 --> 01:58:59,387
..let me know in the future. Got it?

1581
01:58:59,609 --> 01:59:01,046
Now go and talk.

1582
01:59:01,128 --> 01:59:03,706
Ratan, this is not the time to talk.

1583
01:59:03,969 --> 01:59:06,322
There are two very important things
that we need to finish right now.

1584
01:59:06,408 --> 01:59:08,981
Which ones?
- Didn't I tell you while coming here?

1585
01:59:09,584 --> 01:59:13,786
Manohar broke the promise he
made to Parvati during marriage.

1586
01:59:13,843 --> 01:59:17,161
Because of this his studies
and family is destroying.

1587
01:59:17,283 --> 01:59:18,396
What?

1588
01:59:19,267 --> 01:59:21,652
How many people do you
have in your family?

1589
01:59:21,874 --> 01:59:23,249
Eight of them including my mom.

1590
01:59:23,531 --> 01:59:25,729
Eight. How do you manage
your food everyday?

1591
01:59:26,169 --> 01:59:29,345
The Rs 3 you give, we
manage to get something.

1592
01:59:29,528 --> 01:59:30,879
Just Rs 3?

1593
01:59:30,901 --> 01:59:33,583
Nowadays, in Rs 3 not a single
person can eat properly.

1594
01:59:33,635 --> 01:59:35,168
How can eight people eat?

1595
01:59:35,191 --> 01:59:36,509
You are a strange man.

1596
01:59:36,804 --> 01:59:39,439
Anyway, first let's get
some food for the kids.

1597
01:59:39,495 --> 01:59:42,105
Then we will think about your
studies. - Come, Asha.

1598
01:59:54,117 --> 01:59:56,601
What are you looking at?
Help me out.

1599
02:00:06,939 --> 02:00:10,151
Are you asking me the amount?
I am selling anything. Where's your mom?

1600
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:15,359
You might not get anything to
eat but you know to dance.

1601
02:00:15,531 --> 02:00:16,923
I am asking where is your mom.

1602
02:00:18,454 --> 02:00:21,318
You wish to answer this
also using dance moves.

1603
02:00:28,209 --> 02:00:30,855
Ratan, what are you doing here?
- Thank God you are here.

1604
02:00:30,982 --> 02:00:34,894
Why didn't you tell me that a strange
girl roams about in your house?

1605
02:00:35,036 --> 02:00:38,435
She was shouting so much...
- Ratan, don't you know.

1606
02:00:38,533 --> 02:00:40,800
No.
- She is my sister, Kamla.

1607
02:00:41,352 --> 02:00:42,863
She is dumb.
- Dumb?

1608
02:00:43,847 --> 02:00:45,139
Oh!

1609
02:00:47,149 --> 02:00:51,249
I am sorry. Whatever I
said was unknowingly.

1610
02:00:51,495 --> 02:00:53,840
It was my mistake.
I hope you have forgiven me.

1611
02:00:57,263 --> 02:00:58,811
Greetings!
- Greetings!

1612
02:00:59,638 --> 02:01:01,283
Suresh, who are they?

1613
02:01:01,357 --> 02:01:03,487
Ma'am, I am Vibhishan.

1614
02:01:03,619 --> 02:01:07,971
She is my sister. And my
elder brother is Ravana.

1615
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:14,427
Where is this procession going?

1616
02:01:14,593 --> 02:01:17,742
They are my sisters.
- All of them are your sisters?

1617
02:01:18,270 --> 02:01:20,872
Ma'am, there is nothing
to worry about.

1618
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:22,878
You can consider me as
your family member.

1619
02:01:23,015 --> 02:01:24,855
Take a look. We have got
all the grains possible.

1620
02:01:25,169 --> 02:01:27,700
Now no need to suffer.
Please cook something.

1621
02:01:27,788 --> 02:01:29,831
Today, even I will eat here itself.

1622
02:01:29,854 --> 02:01:32,922
Please come. Come. Let's cook fast.

1623
02:01:36,509 --> 02:01:39,369
Parvati's husband's younger sister.

1624
02:01:39,578 --> 02:01:42,416
What is she asking? - You are standing
quietly since you have come.

1625
02:01:42,512 --> 02:01:44,878
She is asking whether
you can talk or not.

1626
02:01:48,036 --> 02:01:49,972
Asha, you had said two things.

1627
02:01:50,029 --> 02:01:52,550
One was the food necessities
of this house. What's next?

1628
02:01:52,883 --> 02:01:53,982
Come here.

1629
02:01:56,587 --> 02:01:58,570
Now come with me and tell Parvati..

1630
02:01:58,621 --> 02:02:01,361
..that you have taken the responsibility
of this family from now on.

1631
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:04,033
And somehow manage to help
Suresh finish his studies.

1632
02:02:04,207 --> 02:02:07,274
She keeps crying all day and
night as she is worried.

1633
02:02:07,555 --> 02:02:09,033
She has stopped eating as well.

1634
02:02:12,203 --> 02:02:14,063
What is this, mother?
- Have it, dear.

1635
02:02:14,637 --> 02:02:17,858
Have some.
- No, mother. I am not hungry.

1636
02:02:17,939 --> 02:02:20,489
You are lying.
You are lying, Parvati.

1637
02:02:20,826 --> 02:02:24,294
You are dealing with a monster.
What better can happen?

1638
02:02:24,543 --> 02:02:26,469
You will have to suffer.

1639
02:02:26,835 --> 02:02:30,470
Look, your kids are sitting with you.

1640
02:02:30,629 --> 02:02:33,997
Look at them.
Have something for them, dear.

1641
02:02:34,215 --> 02:02:36,400
Eat something.
I'll get water for you.

1642
02:02:40,630 --> 02:02:43,441
Mom, why are you sad?

1643
02:02:43,718 --> 02:02:46,202
I am not.
- Don't worry, mom.

1644
02:02:46,224 --> 02:02:48,441
When I grow up, I will earn a lot.

1645
02:02:48,535 --> 02:02:49,688
I will make sure uncle studies.

1646
02:02:49,786 --> 02:02:51,662
I will take care of you as well.

1647
02:02:53,910 --> 02:02:56,362
I'll feed you, mom.
You will eat, won't you?

1648
02:03:14,237 --> 02:03:18,364
Parvati, I thought that I will
feed you with my own hands.

1649
02:03:18,544 --> 02:03:20,434
But these have done it.

1650
02:03:21,162 --> 02:03:23,172
When these kids love you so much..

1651
02:03:23,541 --> 02:03:25,352
..then why are you sad?

1652
02:03:27,747 --> 02:03:30,671
Parvati, don't you
consider us as your own?

1653
02:03:31,381 --> 02:03:32,709
Then wipe your tears.

1654
02:03:33,724 --> 02:03:37,481
So what if Manohar has gone back
on his words? I am still alive.

1655
02:03:38,141 --> 02:03:40,504
Parvati, I visited your family.

1656
02:03:40,878 --> 02:03:44,504
Yes. And I have taken up the
responsibility of your family on me.

1657
02:03:44,785 --> 02:03:49,352
As far as Suresh is concerned, I will
make sure he completes his studies.

1658
02:03:49,578 --> 02:03:50,829
Hey cabbie!

1659
02:03:53,074 --> 02:03:55,583
What did you say?
You will make him a doctor!

1660
02:03:55,622 --> 02:03:56,692
Can you do it?

1661
02:03:57,164 --> 02:03:59,235
What do you have?
- What do you have?

1662
02:03:59,317 --> 02:04:01,301
I have a lot of money in many banks.

1663
02:04:01,379 --> 02:04:04,566
I have wealth. - If you have wealth,
I have determination.

1664
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:08,065
If a man doesn't have anything,
how will determination help?

1665
02:04:08,117 --> 02:04:12,017
C'mon! Anything earned with
determination will remain for ages.

1666
02:04:12,044 --> 02:04:14,603
While the wealth you are talking
about will vanish soon.

1667
02:04:14,796 --> 02:04:16,994
I will make sure he becomes a doctor.
Not just that.

1668
02:04:17,090 --> 02:04:19,267
I will get Asha married
to him as well.

1669
02:04:19,379 --> 02:04:22,084
I see. So this is what
you are thinking.

1670
02:04:22,166 --> 02:04:26,367
I don't just think. Whatever I think
is what I will eventually do.

1671
02:04:26,509 --> 02:04:30,062
I would've done this long back
but Parvati came in between.

1672
02:04:30,087 --> 02:04:34,574
She wants him to become a doctor
first that's why I am not insisting.

1673
02:04:34,651 --> 02:04:37,936
First, let him become a doctor.
Then we'll see.

1674
02:04:37,987 --> 02:04:40,603
Do you money to make him a ward boy?

1675
02:04:40,646 --> 02:04:43,807
Whether I have money or not,
if I fail to help him become a doctor..

1676
02:04:43,900 --> 02:04:45,404
..then I won't ever
show my face to you.

1677
02:04:45,426 --> 02:04:48,594
Get lost! Let's see what you can do.

1678
02:04:52,266 --> 02:04:55,668
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, Ratanlal. How are you?

1679
02:04:55,750 --> 02:04:58,282
I am fine. How are you?
- I am fine.

1680
02:04:58,344 --> 02:05:00,712
Sir, the car you had
given to me..

1681
02:05:00,753 --> 02:05:03,317
..thanks to the almighty
its running well.

1682
02:05:03,602 --> 02:05:06,925
Please keep this month's amount. Rs 200.
- What's the hurry?

1683
02:05:07,023 --> 02:05:08,907
There's a reason, sir.
- What's that?

1684
02:05:09,164 --> 02:05:11,551
Sir, I need Rs 1000 by
10th of this month.

1685
02:05:11,649 --> 02:05:14,581
Will you be able to help?
- You belong to a rich family.

1686
02:05:14,818 --> 02:05:18,453
When I was able to give you a car worth
Rs 15,000, then why not Rs 1000?

1687
02:05:18,578 --> 02:05:20,638
When do you need it?
- Right now if possible.

1688
02:05:20,661 --> 02:05:23,171
Right now? I don't
have any money now.

1689
02:05:23,639 --> 02:05:25,519
Do one thing. Come on the 7th.

1690
02:05:25,598 --> 02:05:27,738
Rs 1000 is nothing.
I can give you more.

1691
02:05:27,778 --> 02:05:31,277
No sir. I don't need
to build a college.

1692
02:05:31,375 --> 02:05:33,214
I needed the money to
get a boy educated.

1693
02:05:33,265 --> 02:05:35,118
Come on the 7th.
I will give it to you.

1694
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:36,348
Sure?
- Absolutely!

1695
02:05:36,431 --> 02:05:37,857
Don't forget.
- I will surely give you.

1696
02:05:37,928 --> 02:05:39,491
Alright. Thank you.

1697
02:05:44,319 --> 02:05:47,143
Whether I have money or not, if I
fail to help him become a doctor..

1698
02:05:47,261 --> 02:05:48,899
..then I won't ever
show my face to you.

1699
02:05:53,963 --> 02:05:55,207
Greetings, sir.

1700
02:05:55,603 --> 02:05:58,752
Greetings.
- Today is 7th. Give me the money.

1701
02:05:59,612 --> 02:06:03,257
I am asking for money and you
are giving me the newspaper.

1702
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:05,582
First read what is written
in the newspaper.

1703
02:06:05,623 --> 02:06:07,902
I don't have time to
read the newspaper, sir.

1704
02:06:07,988 --> 02:06:10,597
Please give me the money, I need to
meet the principal of the college.

1705
02:06:10,774 --> 02:06:13,886
Your brother has given an
advertisement in the newspaper.

1706
02:06:13,986 --> 02:06:16,465
Manohar? Advertisement?
- Yes. Read it.

1707
02:06:16,932 --> 02:06:19,379
'This is to inform
everyone that I have..'

1708
02:06:19,451 --> 02:06:21,679
'..earned all my wealth
through hard work.'

1709
02:06:21,812 --> 02:06:23,281
What a lie!

1710
02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:27,239
'My brother or sister
or any other relative..'

1711
02:06:27,340 --> 02:06:29,862
'..take any kind of loan
from anyone using my name..'

1712
02:06:30,025 --> 02:06:32,370
'..then it won't be
my responsibility.'

1713
02:06:32,449 --> 02:06:33,665
'Manoharlal.'

1714
02:06:33,717 --> 02:06:36,087
Forget about my brother, you
please give me the money.

1715
02:06:36,169 --> 02:06:41,372
Forgive me. I have been lending money
to you because of your brother.

1716
02:06:41,611 --> 02:06:44,076
Get an agreement from
him and take the money.

1717
02:06:44,108 --> 02:06:47,692
Agreement? Neither am I going to
ask and nor will he give it to me.

1718
02:06:47,744 --> 02:06:48,885
Then even I can't give you.

1719
02:06:48,967 --> 02:06:51,750
Don't joke, sir.
Please give me the money.

1720
02:06:51,802 --> 02:06:54,082
I am not joking.
Now listen to me carefully.

1721
02:06:54,324 --> 02:06:58,801
The loan amount that you give me
every month, if you ever become late..

1722
02:06:58,988 --> 02:07:01,045
..I will seize your car.

1723
02:07:01,087 --> 02:07:03,657
If I am unable to give it
then you can seize it.

1724
02:07:03,770 --> 02:07:05,770
But please give me Rs 1000 now.

1725
02:07:06,413 --> 02:07:08,897
Sir, if you don't help
me with this money..

1726
02:07:09,028 --> 02:07:11,224
..then a poor boy will not be
able to complete his studies.

1727
02:07:11,904 --> 02:07:13,278
Please look at me, sir.

1728
02:07:13,550 --> 02:07:17,777
Sir. Really?
Are you promises so fragile?

1729
02:07:17,876 --> 02:07:19,642
You asked me to come on the 7th.

1730
02:07:19,901 --> 02:07:22,131
After all you have
showed your true colors.

1731
02:07:26,597 --> 02:07:29,467
Have you read this?
If I give you a loan..

1732
02:07:29,593 --> 02:07:31,333
..then your brother will
lose his cool on me.

1733
02:07:31,569 --> 02:07:34,052
I am helpless. Forgive me. Bye.

1734
02:07:38,041 --> 02:07:40,911
Where is Ratan, Suresh?
- He said he will come with the money.

1735
02:07:41,112 --> 02:07:43,601
Today is 7th. Hasn't it
arranged for the money yet?

1736
02:07:43,687 --> 02:07:46,329
The money is arranged that's why
he has gone to get the money.

1737
02:07:47,032 --> 02:07:48,127
There he is.

1738
02:07:50,059 --> 02:07:51,470
Did you get the money, Ratan?

1739
02:07:55,975 --> 02:07:59,067
Tell me. Did you get the money?

1740
02:07:59,279 --> 02:08:00,427
Look at this.

1741
02:08:01,103 --> 02:08:05,097
Manohar has posted this on the
newspaper. Who will give us money now?

1742
02:08:05,368 --> 02:08:07,555
The lenders who were
ready to give money..

1743
02:08:07,672 --> 02:08:09,744
..aren't ready to pay a penny
because of this advertisement.

1744
02:08:10,476 --> 02:08:13,698
Whoever I went to ask for money, 
he got me out from there.

1745
02:08:14,317 --> 02:08:17,503
That's fine brother, 
but we should do something.

1746
02:08:17,646 --> 02:08:19,503
Only two days left for college to start.

1747
02:08:19,687 --> 02:08:21,791
So tell him to jump over
the wall and enter the college.

1748
02:08:21,995 --> 02:08:24,280
What nonsense ? 
- Now you tell me what should I do?

1749
02:08:24,630 --> 02:08:26,812
I am very angry on brother.
- Listen!

1750
02:08:27,713 --> 02:08:29,347
It's not your brother's fault.

1751
02:08:30,235 --> 02:08:31,677
My fate is to be blamed.

1752
02:08:31,729 --> 02:08:34,656
Fate on your forehead
not in the newspaper.

1753
02:08:34,712 --> 02:08:36,016
Why drag your fate in it?

1754
02:08:36,392 --> 02:08:37,943
Of course it is.

1755
02:08:38,412 --> 02:08:39,911
I am really unfortunate.

1756
02:08:40,434 --> 02:08:43,005
I think I am destined in
not becoming a doctor.

1757
02:08:43,736 --> 02:08:45,325
It's the final year of my studies.

1758
02:08:45,815 --> 02:08:48,342
My sister had faith on a lender.

1759
02:08:48,741 --> 02:08:50,445
Even he couldn't pay her.

1760
02:08:50,958 --> 02:08:54,589
After that my sister sacrificed
her happiness for my studies.

1761
02:08:55,099 --> 02:08:57,403
Such a huge sacrifice couldn't
help me finish my studies..

1762
02:08:57,508 --> 02:08:59,649
..how will anyone's sacrifice
help me in anyway?

1763
02:08:59,844 --> 02:09:02,061
Forget it. Forget everything.

1764
02:09:02,355 --> 02:09:03,938
Now nothing can happen.

1765
02:09:04,096 --> 02:09:07,632
Whether it is possible or not,
leave that to us.

1766
02:09:08,229 --> 02:09:10,130
Ratan, come here.

1767
02:09:17,980 --> 02:09:21,686
Why, Ratan? Why are you
quiet listening to me?

1768
02:09:23,839 --> 02:09:26,082
We don't have any other way, Ratan.

1769
02:09:27,879 --> 02:09:30,042
If you agree then I'll go.

1770
02:09:30,305 --> 02:09:31,404
Else, I won't.

1771
02:09:33,085 --> 02:09:34,581
What are you thinking, Ratan?

1772
02:09:35,684 --> 02:09:37,521
Okay. Alright.

1773
02:09:38,353 --> 02:09:42,217
After all you are going there with the
idea of helping him in his studies.

1774
02:09:43,492 --> 02:09:46,789
No problem. Go.

1775
02:09:54,535 --> 02:09:56,237
Come, sir. Come.

1776
02:09:56,508 --> 02:09:58,193
Hello!
- Good evening, sir.

1777
02:09:58,260 --> 02:10:00,104
Good morning. Good morning.

1778
02:10:00,184 --> 02:10:02,772
Sir, why don't you come
to our hotel these days?

1779
02:10:03,662 --> 02:10:05,618
What's the use of
coming to your hotel?

1780
02:10:05,956 --> 02:10:08,135
Your hotel doesn't serve drinks.

1781
02:10:08,215 --> 02:10:11,336
What do you want, sir?
Tea, coffee, cold drinks, juices?

1782
02:10:11,409 --> 02:10:14,813
Do human beings drink these things?

1783
02:10:14,859 --> 02:10:17,991
I have already had what I want.

1784
02:10:18,049 --> 02:10:20,497
In fact I have some as well. See.

1785
02:10:21,804 --> 02:10:25,602
Keep it inside. The police might come.
- Why? Are you afraid?

1786
02:10:25,908 --> 02:10:29,809
Idiot! I am a permit holder.
Understood?

1787
02:10:34,017 --> 02:10:35,747
Who is this girl?

1788
02:10:41,732 --> 02:10:42,783
Good.

1789
02:10:42,931 --> 02:10:46,967
Has she come here alone?
- I am seeing her for the first time.

1790
02:10:47,277 --> 02:10:50,795
She is new here.
- Really? Go and find out about her.

1791
02:10:51,017 --> 02:10:52,683
No sir, I can't do this.

1792
02:10:52,804 --> 02:10:55,431
If my manager learns
about, I will lose my job.

1793
02:10:55,567 --> 02:10:59,660
First, listen to what I
want you to find out.

1794
02:10:59,838 --> 02:11:03,194
Find out whether she has
come here to have tea..

1795
02:11:03,298 --> 02:11:06,500
..or have food or to make a call.

1796
02:11:06,611 --> 02:11:09,856
Can't you find that out?
- Yes, I can.

1797
02:11:10,284 --> 02:11:13,721
What do you think?
- I thought something else.

1798
02:11:15,248 --> 02:11:17,874
What's the need of this?
- Go. Hurry up.

1799
02:11:31,199 --> 02:11:34,544
Sir, you were right.
She comes here for money.

1800
02:11:34,570 --> 02:11:36,202
Oh! Very good.

1801
02:11:36,292 --> 02:11:39,353
She has connections with a rich man.
- Didn't I tell you?

1802
02:11:39,575 --> 02:11:41,461
Go and find out more about her.

1803
02:11:42,408 --> 02:11:47,852
She is coming here. Go and find out
about her. - No, sir. I can't.

1804
02:11:47,926 --> 02:11:51,188
I am going.
- He is going! Idiot!

1805
02:11:55,185 --> 02:11:57,154
Can I do anything for you?

1806
02:11:57,694 --> 02:12:01,623
Sorry. Ma'am. Please listen
to me, ma'am. Excuse me.

1807
02:12:01,662 --> 02:12:06,020
Idiot! You came in between.
Get out! Get out! Get out!

1808
02:12:08,785 --> 02:12:10,805
Ratan, why are you worried?
- Keep quiet.

1809
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:12,529
Today is 9th and tomorrow is 10th.

1810
02:12:12,611 --> 02:12:14,577
Asha had gone to get money.
She hasn't come back yet.

1811
02:12:14,651 --> 02:12:16,584
I won't go back on my promise
that I made to Manohar.

1812
02:12:17,802 --> 02:12:21,384
There she is. Asha, have you
got the money? - Yes, Ratan.

1813
02:12:24,418 --> 02:12:25,980
Come. Sit in the car.

1814
02:12:38,683 --> 02:12:41,535
Go. Hurry up and submit your fees.
Some people are still going.

1815
02:12:41,591 --> 02:12:42,691
We have time.

1816
02:12:46,056 --> 02:12:47,876
A huge responsibility
has been taken care of.

1817
02:12:54,718 --> 02:12:55,540
Take it.

1818
02:12:59,875 --> 02:13:01,899
Hey. Come here.

1819
02:13:05,191 --> 02:13:06,807
Is this the way to serve milk?

1820
02:13:07,478 --> 02:13:08,744
Are you showing your anger?

1821
02:13:09,312 --> 02:13:12,074
A waiter from the hotel also
serves it with a smile.

1822
02:13:12,346 --> 02:13:14,986
Beloved wife, is this milk?

1823
02:13:15,469 --> 02:13:18,121
You have made your face as if
you have served poison to me.

1824
02:13:18,488 --> 02:13:22,104
Look, if you want to stay
with me then keep smiling.

1825
02:13:22,187 --> 02:13:26,644
Be happy. Else, I will leave
this house and go. I am serious.

1826
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:30,694
What are you saying? Come here.
Sit down.

1827
02:13:31,871 --> 02:13:36,785
Tell me something. What has happened
that is making you so angry?

1828
02:13:37,281 --> 02:13:40,019
If I have made a mistake then
you should let me know of it.

1829
02:13:40,247 --> 02:13:42,594
You can correct me at any
given point of time.

1830
02:13:43,090 --> 02:13:45,735
Then I will do what
you ask me to do.

1831
02:13:46,072 --> 02:13:50,537
You never do that instead you are
saying that you will leave this house.

1832
02:13:51,081 --> 02:13:55,068
If you leave then
what will we do here?

1833
02:13:55,862 --> 02:13:59,060
If you talk to me like
this just once a day..

1834
02:13:59,090 --> 02:14:00,516
..then I will be so happy.

1835
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:03,440
Here, have some milk.
- You have it.

1836
02:14:03,498 --> 02:14:06,752
You first. If you don't
have it then even I won't.

1837
02:14:08,090 --> 02:14:10,563
Manoharlal!
- Who is it?

1838
02:14:10,644 --> 02:14:12,895
Loser! Gooseberry!

1839
02:14:13,109 --> 02:14:15,998
I can see that you sitting at ease.
I hope you are alright.

1840
02:14:16,039 --> 02:14:19,260
Who are you? Get up! Who are you?
Where are you from? - What?

1841
02:14:21,272 --> 02:14:23,750
What is this, Manoharlal?
- You didn't recognise me?

1842
02:14:23,997 --> 02:14:27,788
5 years ago the two of us
together took big contracts.

1843
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,599
We earned a lot of money.

1844
02:14:29,667 --> 02:14:34,306
We used to be together all the time.
Have you forgotten already?

1845
02:14:34,336 --> 02:14:36,218
Fine. What do you want now?

1846
02:14:36,315 --> 02:14:40,152
Me? I have come to fix the marriage
of my son and your sister.

1847
02:14:40,288 --> 02:14:44,749
I know you son. He keeps roaming
about the city in a drunk state.

1848
02:14:44,780 --> 02:14:47,522
You want my sister to get
married to a drunkard. No way!

1849
02:14:47,750 --> 02:14:51,714
He is young man.
He is bound to do such things.

1850
02:14:51,954 --> 02:14:54,475
Once he gets married, things
will fall in place for him.

1851
02:14:54,507 --> 02:14:57,854
Forget about him. First you tell
me when will you mend your ways?

1852
02:14:57,952 --> 02:15:00,466
What's the point of mending
our ways at this age?

1853
02:15:00,497 --> 02:15:05,243
You enter a gentleman's house, climb the
staircase without informing anyone.

1854
02:15:05,296 --> 02:15:09,268
You enter his bedroom without
even knocking like an illiterate.

1855
02:15:09,383 --> 02:15:13,772
Above it all, you want my
sister to my your son!

1856
02:15:13,784 --> 02:15:15,376
Get lost!
- C'mon!

1857
02:15:15,430 --> 02:15:16,733
Don't sit! Get up!

1858
02:15:17,396 --> 02:15:20,573
Manoharlal, remember one thing.

1859
02:15:20,921 --> 02:15:22,502
Even I am wealthy just like you.

1860
02:15:22,565 --> 02:15:25,689
Go and enjoy with your wealth.
Get out!

1861
02:15:25,952 --> 02:15:27,179
I am going.
- Go!

1862
02:15:27,345 --> 02:15:28,370
I am going.

1863
02:15:40,862 --> 02:15:45,663
Wow! The girl has come again.

1864
02:15:48,033 --> 02:15:53,961
Greetings! I have waiting for you.
Please say something. Listen. Listen!

1865
02:15:54,488 --> 02:15:58,799
Ma'am, please! She's gone. Gone.

1866
02:15:59,097 --> 02:16:02,437
She won't talk to me. Alright.

1867
02:16:04,671 --> 02:16:08,769
Take it, Ratan. - What is this?
Suresh gave his exams a month ago.

1868
02:16:08,848 --> 02:16:11,151
Why have you brought money then?
- How will his family survive?

1869
02:16:11,559 --> 02:16:14,928
Oh! So you are worried
about his family already!

1870
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:17,880
I am right here and so is my cab.

1871
02:16:18,303 --> 02:16:21,967
Alright. No problem. Give.
- How did his exams go?

1872
02:16:22,118 --> 02:16:26,323
How would I know? He is right here.
Ask him yourself. - Go ahead.

1873
02:16:26,538 --> 02:16:29,084
My exams were good, Asha.
I will surely pass.

1874
02:16:29,166 --> 02:16:32,756
Ratan, as soon as his results are out,
I should be the first one to know.

1875
02:16:32,944 --> 02:16:36,212
Surely. But before Manohar
learns that you are here..

1876
02:16:36,391 --> 02:16:39,530
..please leave immediately. Go. Go on.

1877
02:16:41,486 --> 02:16:43,665
Ratan, the results will
be out in some time.

1878
02:16:43,754 --> 02:16:46,227
Why did you send her away then?
- You are very innocent.

1879
02:16:46,537 --> 02:16:48,924
In case, out of ill-fate you fail..

1880
02:16:49,193 --> 02:16:52,895
..then she would've been shattered.
She would've fainted here itself.

1881
02:16:52,943 --> 02:16:55,990
Do you get it?
The newspaper has come.

1882
02:16:57,604 --> 02:16:59,589
Wait! Give it to me!

1883
02:17:04,445 --> 02:17:07,679
Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?

1884
02:17:08,732 --> 02:17:10,070
Here it is!

1885
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:13,196
1st Class! Take a look.
Wow, son. Great!

1886
02:17:14,508 --> 02:17:17,017
You did a fantastic job.
You have passed with first class.

1887
02:17:18,651 --> 02:17:21,885
Ratan, this has been
possible because of you.

1888
02:17:21,933 --> 02:17:24,584
C'mon! I did not write the exams.

1889
02:17:24,636 --> 02:17:28,334
Doctor Suresh, I have just kept
my promise unlike my brother.

1890
02:17:28,536 --> 02:17:30,772
Come. Let's inform Parvati first.
Come.

1891
02:17:31,781 --> 02:17:35,306
Parvati! Parvati! Parvati!
- What is it?

1892
02:17:35,438 --> 02:17:38,976
Parvati!
- Tell me, what is the matter?

1893
02:17:39,045 --> 02:17:41,410
Parvati, you will be so proud today.

1894
02:17:41,457 --> 02:17:43,144
Your wishes have come true.

1895
02:17:43,214 --> 02:17:46,172
Your brother... Come here.
He is a doctor now.

1896
02:17:46,299 --> 02:17:49,337
Take a look. His percentage is given.
Take a look.

1897
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:55,713
Ratan, you helped my brother complete
his studies and not just that..

1898
02:17:56,255 --> 02:18:00,136
..you gave a life to
6 ill-fated girls.

1899
02:18:00,219 --> 02:18:02,239
It's because of your
blessings, Parvati.

1900
02:18:02,610 --> 02:18:05,458
Go and take her blessings. C'mon!

1901
02:18:08,016 --> 02:18:09,517
Suresh.
- Parvati.

1902
02:18:12,650 --> 02:18:15,076
Parvati, I need to talk to you
about something important.

1903
02:18:15,410 --> 02:18:18,949
He is a doctor now and can take care
of all problems, even heart problems.

1904
02:18:19,060 --> 02:18:21,475
Manohar has some
serious heart issues.

1905
02:18:21,537 --> 02:18:24,395
I mean he is stone-hearted.
Don't mind, Parvati.

1906
02:18:24,559 --> 02:18:28,699
Doctor Suresh, why don't you start
your practicing from Manohar. - Quiet.

1907
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,429
If you say such things,
he will lose his cool.

1908
02:18:31,524 --> 02:18:33,210
Yes, I know my brother.

1909
02:18:33,256 --> 02:18:36,264
But today I will say what I have to.
- C'mon, doctor.

1910
02:18:36,838 --> 02:18:40,216
Brother.
- Hey, why are you shouting?

1911
02:18:40,269 --> 02:18:45,621
I am not shouting, my dear brother.
Remember, you had said one day.

1912
02:18:45,737 --> 02:18:49,069
What did you say then? That I won't
be able to fund his studies.

1913
02:18:49,250 --> 02:18:51,808
Take a close look. Today, I have
managed to helped him become a doctor.

1914
02:18:51,881 --> 02:18:54,448
MBBS. His percentage is here.
Take a look.

1915
02:18:54,763 --> 02:18:59,884
Don't be mad, brother. I have
come here with a good news.

1916
02:19:00,004 --> 02:19:03,168
Also, I would like to
request something to you.

1917
02:19:03,234 --> 02:19:05,823
Now get Asha and Suresh married.

1918
02:19:05,945 --> 02:19:08,327
This is so that you
don't feel left out.

1919
02:19:08,381 --> 02:19:10,897
Do you think I am ready
for this association?

1920
02:19:10,945 --> 02:19:13,143
Whether you agree or not, I am ready.

1921
02:19:13,167 --> 02:19:15,947
How will that help?
- Oh really!

1922
02:19:15,999 --> 02:19:18,338
They will become husband & wife.
- Come, doctor.

1923
02:19:29,130 --> 02:19:30,890
Listen. Come here.

1924
02:19:31,641 --> 02:19:36,881
The beggar Manoharlal must have
had food here so many times.

1925
02:19:37,043 --> 02:19:39,001
You must've served him as well.

1926
02:19:39,234 --> 02:19:42,473
Forget about it. For how long
will you keep cribbing about it?

1927
02:19:42,557 --> 02:19:44,631
What did you say? Am I cribbing?

1928
02:19:44,899 --> 02:19:48,330
Do you know what he said to me?
He called me an illiterate man!

1929
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:50,488
Won't I feel bad about it?

1930
02:19:50,617 --> 02:19:52,138
Sir!
- Get lost!

1931
02:19:52,362 --> 02:19:54,064
Mr. Manoharlal has come.
- Who?

1932
02:19:54,128 --> 02:19:55,658
Mr. Manoharlal.
- Oh!

1933
02:19:56,353 --> 02:19:59,497
Mr. Manoharlal! God has sent him.

1934
02:19:59,807 --> 02:20:01,626
I will seek revenge.

1935
02:20:01,730 --> 02:20:05,319
Take these chairs away. Hurry up!

1936
02:20:06,355 --> 02:20:09,085
Listen, sit here.
- What are you doing?

1937
02:20:09,131 --> 02:20:11,559
Leave me.
- I said, sit here.

1938
02:20:13,554 --> 02:20:16,543
Listen! Go and send him inside.

1939
02:20:17,686 --> 02:20:19,889
Hurry up!
Let him come.

1940
02:20:21,778 --> 02:20:28,741
Greetings, Mr. Dinanath! Wow! What a
beautiful pair this is! - Who are you?

1941
02:20:29,145 --> 02:20:32,713
Aren't you able to see that a
husband and wife are sitting alone?

1942
02:20:32,871 --> 02:20:36,404
How dare you enter the room without
knocking like an illiterate?

1943
02:20:36,609 --> 02:20:38,151
Do you have any manners?

1944
02:20:38,289 --> 02:20:43,053
Mr. Dinanath, I know you are seeking
revenge for what I said that day.

1945
02:20:43,126 --> 02:20:47,902
The thing is that I had a small
argument with my wife that day.

1946
02:20:48,010 --> 02:20:49,864
That's why I lost my cool.

1947
02:20:49,928 --> 02:20:54,227
Everyone loses someone's cool but
that doesn't mean you speak rubbish.

1948
02:20:54,412 --> 02:20:58,022
That day it was my mistake.
But you are my friend.

1949
02:20:58,074 --> 02:21:00,263
If you don't forgive me, who will?

1950
02:21:00,402 --> 02:21:03,871
Listen, today I have come with a
suggestion. - What suggestion?

1951
02:21:04,122 --> 02:21:06,959
Get your son and my sister married.

1952
02:21:07,991 --> 02:21:10,588
Forget about the old tiffs.
Don't be mad.

1953
02:21:10,950 --> 02:21:16,139
Manoharlal, I wanted you to realise.
That's done.

1954
02:21:16,370 --> 02:21:17,911
Listen, get a chair.

1955
02:21:17,993 --> 02:21:22,070
There's no need for chair.
I am happy now. Let's go. - Where?

1956
02:21:22,124 --> 02:21:23,739
Let's begin with the preparations.

1957
02:21:23,781 --> 02:21:25,849
You are strange man.
It isn't my marriage

1958
02:21:25,932 --> 02:21:28,966
First, let the girl and boy meet.
- Get the boy along. Let's go.

1959
02:21:29,029 --> 02:21:30,881
My son isn't at home now.

1960
02:21:31,066 --> 02:21:35,068
I will get him to your house on an
auspicious day. - Don't forget.

1961
02:21:35,229 --> 02:21:37,802
Yes. - Ma'am, it seems he
is still a bit mad at me.

1962
02:21:37,884 --> 02:21:40,390
It would be your responsibility
to get him. I'll take your leave.

1963
02:21:41,311 --> 02:21:42,819
Asha!
- Yes, Manohar.

1964
02:21:42,901 --> 02:21:44,693
You will not go out
of house from now on.

1965
02:21:44,746 --> 02:21:46,975
If you do, you will
see the worst of me.

1966
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:55,823
Driver! Where are you?
- I am here, sir. Please come.

1967
02:21:55,873 --> 02:21:59,453
Hey, what's this?
A cab always has 2 colors.

1968
02:21:59,533 --> 02:22:02,310
But yours is just one color.
- This is a private cab, sir.

1969
02:22:02,347 --> 02:22:05,018
This runs inside the city as
well as outside the city.

1970
02:22:05,108 --> 02:22:07,552
I have my license.
Please come and sit.

1971
02:22:07,684 --> 02:22:11,270
I asked you because we are going
to see a potential bride.

1972
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:14,759
Oh! - If someone stops in the middle
of the road and creates a ruckus..

1973
02:22:14,836 --> 02:22:16,173
..we'll get worried unnecessarily.

1974
02:22:16,214 --> 02:22:17,528
There will be no problem, sir.

1975
02:22:17,605 --> 02:22:20,059
Whoever has traveled in it
to visit a potential bride..

1976
02:22:20,093 --> 02:22:23,275
..have got married happily.
Please come. There's nothing to worry.

1977
02:22:23,351 --> 02:22:24,633
That's great.

1978
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:34,190
Gopal, behave yourself in front
of them. - Sir.

1979
02:22:34,414 --> 02:22:36,577
Have you come here to
meet a potential bride?

1980
02:22:36,635 --> 02:22:40,125
Why?
- Had you come in your own car..

1981
02:22:40,232 --> 02:22:41,893
..even then you wouldn't
have received any honor.

1982
02:22:41,931 --> 02:22:43,461
You have come here in a cab!

1983
02:22:43,731 --> 02:22:46,234
This house belongs to
a very rich man, sir.

1984
02:22:46,532 --> 02:22:49,161
Am I a poor man?
- No.

1985
02:22:49,363 --> 02:22:50,944
Both are equal.
- Isn't it?

1986
02:22:50,996 --> 02:22:51,964
Yes. Go on.

1987
02:22:52,261 --> 02:22:53,475
Come.

1988
02:22:55,204 --> 02:22:58,173
Hey, come. Sit down.

1989
02:22:58,896 --> 02:23:02,137
We thought you will be coming in
the morning. Anyway, no problem.

1990
02:23:02,237 --> 02:23:03,846
What would you like? Tea or coffee?

1991
02:23:03,898 --> 02:23:06,127
First, we wish to meet the girl.

1992
02:23:06,166 --> 02:23:08,926
Tea and coffee can be done later.
- Alright.

1993
02:23:09,013 --> 02:23:10,255
Mom!

1994
02:23:11,042 --> 02:23:13,344
Hey! Did he call you? Sit down!

1995
02:23:14,074 --> 02:23:17,343
Parvati, it is late. They are waiting.
Where is Asha?

1996
02:23:17,441 --> 02:23:19,476
Asha is coming.
- Yes, send her soon.

1997
02:23:20,965 --> 02:23:22,695
She is coming in sometime.
- No problem.

1998
02:23:22,794 --> 02:23:24,815
We thought you will be
coming in the morning.

1999
02:23:24,866 --> 02:23:27,445
That's why she got ready
in the morning itself.

2000
02:23:27,490 --> 02:23:30,645
When you didn't come, she changed.
Now she is getting ready again.

2001
02:23:30,727 --> 02:23:33,451
Oh! She is getting ready again.
- Yes, she is coming.

2002
02:23:33,534 --> 02:23:34,705
Okay.

2003
02:23:34,766 --> 02:23:37,056
C'mon. Wipe your tears.

2004
02:23:39,149 --> 02:23:40,321
Go on.

2005
02:23:42,931 --> 02:23:45,720
I would suggest let them get
married as soon as possible.

2006
02:23:45,802 --> 02:23:47,536
Find an auspicious time
in this week itself.

2007
02:23:47,554 --> 02:23:51,537
That's the reason I had come
to meet you the other day.

2008
02:23:51,958 --> 02:23:53,370
Forget about it.

2009
02:24:15,262 --> 02:24:16,873
Dad.
- What is it?

2010
02:24:17,056 --> 02:24:18,765
Is she the one?
- Yes.

2011
02:24:18,943 --> 02:24:20,458
Is she good?
- Yes.

2012
02:24:20,491 --> 02:24:22,413
Then what's the problem.
- Do you know who she is?

2013
02:24:22,448 --> 02:24:24,083
His sister.
- No. I am not saying that.

2014
02:24:24,165 --> 02:24:25,805
We will talk about all this at home.

2015
02:24:25,814 --> 02:24:29,602
So? I hope he likes her.
What is your son saying?

2016
02:24:29,702 --> 02:24:32,359
Nothing. He is asking
is she your sister?

2017
02:24:32,413 --> 02:24:34,929
Yes. Just get the auspicious
time for marriage fixed.

2018
02:24:34,951 --> 02:24:37,022
Let's get it done this week itself.
We'll take your leave...

2019
02:24:37,074 --> 02:24:39,712
Wait. Please have some tea.

2020
02:24:39,764 --> 02:24:42,916
Now we will have a
grand wedding feast.

2021
02:24:42,999 --> 02:24:44,699
Alright. No problem.

2022
02:24:45,181 --> 02:24:46,273
Greetings!
- Greetings!

2023
02:24:46,355 --> 02:24:47,125
Greetings!
- Greetings!

2024
02:24:47,150 --> 02:24:48,118
Let's go.

2025
02:24:52,473 --> 02:24:54,003
Ratan, won't win.

2026
02:24:54,570 --> 02:24:56,283
He was challenging me!

2027
02:24:57,143 --> 02:24:58,905
Dad. Dad, that girl...

2028
02:24:58,970 --> 02:25:01,872
Oh God! Why are you
irritating me so much?

2029
02:25:01,907 --> 02:25:03,672
I have fixed your marriage with her.

2030
02:25:03,695 --> 02:25:06,943
That's not the point. That girl goes
to the hotel and earns money often.

2031
02:25:06,974 --> 02:25:08,188
Shut up, idiot!

2032
02:25:08,269 --> 02:25:10,203
A rich man's sister
will go to the hotel!

2033
02:25:10,255 --> 02:25:13,284
I am telling the truth. I have seen
her in the hotel a lot of times.

2034
02:25:13,326 --> 02:25:15,858
You must have seen some other
girl in a drunk state.

2035
02:25:15,916 --> 02:25:17,702
Crazy fellow!

2036
02:25:17,878 --> 02:25:21,067
He is telling the truth.
- Shut up! What is right?

2037
02:25:21,161 --> 02:25:25,171
Don't be mad, sir.
Nothing is hidden from a cab driver.

2038
02:25:25,489 --> 02:25:28,722
I have seen her go
to the hotel myself.

2039
02:25:28,805 --> 02:25:30,700
What?
- Yes.

2040
02:25:30,949 --> 02:25:35,553
Manoharlal is such a creep.
So this is how he became a rich man!

2041
02:25:35,706 --> 02:25:37,825
Do you still want to get
your son married to her?

2042
02:25:37,877 --> 02:25:40,054
Reverse the cab.
- That's a like a man!

2043
02:25:41,272 --> 02:25:43,975
Manoharlal! Manoharlal!

2044
02:25:43,997 --> 02:25:46,028
Please come. What happened?

2045
02:25:46,109 --> 02:25:49,850
You have come back.
Is the date fixed? - Shut up!

2046
02:25:50,003 --> 02:25:54,444
After seeing what your sister does,
no one would want to marry her.

2047
02:25:54,566 --> 02:25:56,410
What nonsense are you talking about?

2048
02:25:56,493 --> 02:25:58,155
Are you trying to fool us?

2049
02:25:58,237 --> 02:25:59,840
Am I fooling you? Really!

2050
02:25:59,900 --> 02:26:02,407
Yes, you are.
You pretend to be a rich man!

2051
02:26:02,621 --> 02:26:06,776
When I came home to talk about your
sister's marriage with my son..

2052
02:26:06,856 --> 02:26:09,209
..you insulted me and
asked me to leave.

2053
02:26:09,291 --> 02:26:13,004
Then you came to my house asking
to consider the alliance.

2054
02:26:13,074 --> 02:26:16,786
I knew it that moment
that something is wrong.

2055
02:26:16,997 --> 02:26:19,523
What's wrong?
What nonsense are you talking?

2056
02:26:19,635 --> 02:26:24,162
Am I? Your sister goes to the
hotel to earn money. Yes or no?

2057
02:26:24,221 --> 02:26:26,358
What did you say? Get out of here!

2058
02:26:26,396 --> 02:26:30,770
Now that the truth is out,
you are getting wild! - Get out!

2059
02:26:31,076 --> 02:26:33,828
A rich man's sister doesn't
need to do that. - Rubbish!

2060
02:26:33,917 --> 02:26:39,366
Rich man! Not just once, my son has
seen your sister a lot of times there.

2061
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:41,332
Your son is not truthful either.

2062
02:26:41,371 --> 02:26:44,435
Not just him.
Even the cab driver said so.

2063
02:26:44,489 --> 02:26:46,980
Which driver? - He is waiting outside.
Call him and ask.

2064
02:26:47,054 --> 02:26:48,283
Driver!

2065
02:26:56,482 --> 02:26:58,201
Oh! It's you!

2066
02:26:59,797 --> 02:27:03,499
So you are doing this so
that they don't get married!

2067
02:27:05,530 --> 02:27:07,868
Hey!
- It is true.

2068
02:27:08,680 --> 02:27:10,294
Asha used to go to the hotel.

2069
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:13,404
Now what do you have to say?
- Shut up!

2070
02:27:13,705 --> 02:27:16,902
Hey!
- I am telling the truth.

2071
02:27:16,930 --> 02:27:21,315
So, our sister Asha used to go to
the hotel! - Why don't you ask her?

2072
02:27:21,430 --> 02:27:22,967
What if she refuses?

2073
02:27:23,023 --> 02:27:25,462
First, call her and ask.
- What is she refuses?

2074
02:27:25,566 --> 02:27:27,963
Then I will kill myself.
- Asha!

2075
02:27:32,568 --> 02:27:34,280
Did you go to the hotel?
- Yes.

2076
02:27:35,322 --> 02:27:37,133
Why did you go?
- For money.

2077
02:27:37,211 --> 02:27:38,466
For money!

2078
02:27:39,759 --> 02:27:42,325
First, ask her why she needed money.

2079
02:27:42,445 --> 02:27:44,215
Then you can do what you want.
Ask her.

2080
02:27:44,473 --> 02:27:46,125
Why did you need money?

2081
02:27:46,472 --> 02:27:49,265
To help Suresh finish his studies.
- You went to the hotel for that!

2082
02:27:49,327 --> 02:27:51,410
Is it right for a girl to
go to the hotel like that?

2083
02:27:51,505 --> 02:27:54,210
Was it right for you to promise a poor
family and go back on your words?

2084
02:27:54,440 --> 02:27:56,441
Shut up! Else...
- I won't keep quiet!

2085
02:27:56,479 --> 02:27:59,205
Suresh wasn't able to study because
you went back on your words.

2086
02:27:59,274 --> 02:28:01,416
His family couldn't survive.

2087
02:28:01,845 --> 02:28:05,306
Thanks to our sister that Suresh was
able to complete his final year.

2088
02:28:05,364 --> 02:28:08,898
Because of that his family
will be able to survive.

2089
02:28:08,977 --> 02:28:11,848
Ratan, she went to the
hotel for a dumb girl.

2090
02:28:12,020 --> 02:28:13,891
She went there for 6 helpless kids.

2091
02:28:14,350 --> 02:28:18,005
Why? Why will our
sister go to the hotel..

2092
02:28:18,123 --> 02:28:20,059
..to feed an unknown family?

2093
02:28:20,166 --> 02:28:24,517
Not just for that, she completed a
responsibility you had taken up.

2094
02:28:24,678 --> 02:28:27,903
So, it is true that you
went to the hotel.

2095
02:28:28,358 --> 02:28:30,085
That too for money.

2096
02:28:30,267 --> 02:28:33,579
Not for money, Manohar.
For Suresh's studies.

2097
02:28:34,176 --> 02:28:36,509
How dare you do something like that?

2098
02:28:36,597 --> 02:28:38,866
One needs to be courageous
to be able to do good.

2099
02:28:38,927 --> 02:28:41,625
So, you knew that she
went to the hotel!

2100
02:28:41,715 --> 02:28:43,959
What do you mean?
I was the one to send her there.

2101
02:28:44,661 --> 02:28:46,717
Idiotic girl! Go and die!

2102
02:28:48,524 --> 02:28:51,274
Did you really go?
- Yes, I did.

2103
02:28:51,292 --> 02:28:54,146
You did! Idiotic girl!
Shameless woman!

2104
02:28:54,261 --> 02:28:56,699
You have defamed our family.

2105
02:28:56,912 --> 02:29:00,649
Had you died for Suresh's
studies, I would've been happier.

2106
02:29:00,795 --> 02:29:03,014
Shameless! Die!

2107
02:29:03,399 --> 02:29:07,214
How can you be so shameless to say
that you went to a hotel to earn?

2108
02:29:07,305 --> 02:29:10,013
How dare you! How dare you!
How dare you!

2109
02:29:10,121 --> 02:29:11,577
Parvati! Listen to me.

2110
02:29:11,629 --> 02:29:15,444
What is left to be heard?
You were the one who sent her there.

2111
02:29:15,572 --> 02:29:17,297
Yes, I did.

2112
02:29:17,361 --> 02:29:21,086
Shameless! You sent a
girl to the hotel.

2113
02:29:21,176 --> 02:29:24,486
You sent your sister to the hotel!

2114
02:29:24,569 --> 02:29:27,406
Yes, I sent my sister to the hotel.

2115
02:29:27,608 --> 02:29:30,257
You did! You did! You did!
- Parvati!

2116
02:29:30,928 --> 02:29:32,995
Even you had been to the hotel once.
Right?

2117
02:29:40,569 --> 02:29:41,986
Why are you quiet now?

2118
02:29:42,398 --> 02:29:45,162
All the girls who go to the
hotel don't always do wrong.

2119
02:29:45,554 --> 02:29:48,151
Do you really think Asha
will do something like that?

2120
02:29:48,426 --> 02:29:50,014
Had she done anything wrong..

2121
02:29:50,094 --> 02:29:52,026
..do you think I would've been
standing here alive in front of you?

2122
02:29:52,210 --> 02:29:54,312
This great man standing here.
My brother.

2123
02:29:54,390 --> 02:29:56,797
I had to lie so that he
realizes his mistakes.

2124
02:29:57,210 --> 02:29:58,668
Lie!
- Yes, Parvati.

2125
02:29:59,065 --> 02:30:00,734
You just beat us up really quick.

2126
02:30:01,525 --> 02:30:04,662
Parvati, you were in love
with someone, right?

2127
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:09,346
Do you know that he was fighting a
case for the wealth worth Rs 4,00,000?

2128
02:30:10,139 --> 02:30:13,851
Do you know that he had won that
case and he got that money?

2129
02:30:14,492 --> 02:30:17,278
Do you know that he made
a hotel from that money?

2130
02:30:17,617 --> 02:30:19,651
Do you know that this
is the same hotel?

2131
02:30:20,376 --> 02:30:23,463
No. - Then you don't
know us either, Parvati.

2132
02:30:24,083 --> 02:30:29,039
Parvati, he met Asha one day and
asked her about you and Suresh.

2133
02:30:29,096 --> 02:30:33,623
He had asked her to inform him
if we ever needed his help.

2134
02:30:33,702 --> 02:30:37,951
He said if he was able to help,
he would be more than happy.

2135
02:30:38,028 --> 02:30:39,587
Asha told me about it.

2136
02:30:39,878 --> 02:30:44,669
When we desperately needed money,
I asked her to get the money.

2137
02:30:45,061 --> 02:30:47,935
He isn't an unknown person.
We would've returned the money.

2138
02:30:48,153 --> 02:30:50,413
That's when Asha went to the
hotel and got the money.

2139
02:30:50,574 --> 02:30:53,168
Even mom knew about it.
- Mom!

2140
02:30:53,927 --> 02:30:57,807
What is it?
- Mother, what is all this?

2141
02:30:57,817 --> 02:31:00,583
Yes, dear. I agreed to it.

2142
02:31:01,202 --> 02:31:02,938
Nothing is wrong in this.

2143
02:31:03,234 --> 02:31:07,174
I did this to make him
realise that he is wrong.

2144
02:31:07,344 --> 02:31:11,157
I agreed to this so that
this family is happy.

2145
02:31:11,933 --> 02:31:15,112
Parvati, you are so pious and pure.

2146
02:31:15,494 --> 02:31:18,598
A girl from the family that you are in
can never do anything wrong.

2147
02:31:19,236 --> 02:31:21,803
Can Asha do anything wrong?

2148
02:31:28,056 --> 02:31:31,310
Manoharlal, stop!
Stop it, Manoharlal!

2149
02:31:31,449 --> 02:31:33,757
Let me die!
- Stop it! Stop!

2150
02:31:33,848 --> 02:31:37,199
Wait! Stop!
- I have committed a sin.

2151
02:31:37,332 --> 02:31:39,202
I doubted my own sister.

2152
02:31:39,294 --> 02:31:42,206
Not just you, even we
did so, Manoharlal.

2153
02:31:42,273 --> 02:31:45,008
But now that we know the
truth, we have learnt..

2154
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:47,007
..that your sister is a gem.

2155
02:31:47,029 --> 02:31:49,371
I am ashamed of myself.

2156
02:31:50,226 --> 02:31:52,420
If possible, please forgive me.
- What are you doing?

2157
02:31:52,460 --> 02:31:53,933
Let go of me.

2158
02:32:00,861 --> 02:32:03,337
Suresh, please forgive me.

2159
02:32:04,038 --> 02:32:05,640
Come. Come here.

2160
02:32:08,748 --> 02:32:10,748
Always be happy.
- Wow!

2161
02:32:10,912 --> 02:32:14,014
Whatever God does is for the good.

2162
02:32:22,302 --> 02:32:25,399
You are behind all the good
things that happened to me.

2163
02:32:25,928 --> 02:32:30,167
I just learnt that you helped my
brother complete his studies.

2164
02:32:30,766 --> 02:32:33,828
I will always remember your favors.

2165
02:32:33,968 --> 02:32:38,113
Parvati, I am not here to
hear good things about me.

2166
02:32:38,992 --> 02:32:41,736
I have come here to ask
something from you.

2167
02:32:41,849 --> 02:32:44,474
What?
- I hope you won't refuse.

2168
02:32:44,623 --> 02:32:47,431
If I am able to give you,
I definitely will.

2169
02:32:47,599 --> 02:32:50,177
First, tell me that
you have forgiven me.

2170
02:32:50,376 --> 02:32:51,777
Forgiveness? For what?

2171
02:32:52,095 --> 02:32:55,299
I hope you remember,
you had asked me..

2172
02:32:55,828 --> 02:32:59,510
..to get married to someone
and be happy. - Yes.

2173
02:32:59,906 --> 02:33:03,585
After a long time, I really liked
a girl and I got married to her.

2174
02:33:03,669 --> 02:33:07,212
Really? Why did you have
to apologise for that?

2175
02:33:07,313 --> 02:33:10,562
I got married without informing you.
That's why.

2176
02:33:10,846 --> 02:33:12,506
I have got my wife along.

2177
02:33:13,173 --> 02:33:15,022
Where is she?
- Wait.

2178
02:33:16,343 --> 02:33:17,477
I'll get her.

2179
02:33:23,572 --> 02:33:24,829
Kamla!

2180
02:33:31,107 --> 02:33:33,289
Sir, you are great!

2181
02:33:33,358 --> 02:33:35,396
May God always bless you.

2182
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:38,991
Mr. Dinanath, don't you wish to go back?
The cab meter is on.

2183
02:33:39,031 --> 02:33:42,028
Let's go. Let's go.
- I don't sit in cabs much.

2184
02:33:42,068 --> 02:33:44,379
I had to sit today because of him.
