1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,440
I have seen his love story.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,880
Quiet interesting.
- Absolutely.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,240
If we want a twist in it...

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,560
I would need a smart man who...

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,040
who can handle any situation.

6
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,120
There is only one measurement
in Hyderabad...

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,840
like you said.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,040
Battabi!

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,840
Battabi!

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,320
Battabi!

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,920
Battabi!

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,160
He has a brain smarter than wolf.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,000
Battabi!

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,720
He is a champion when it comes
to illegal activities.

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,160
Battabi!

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,800
He is the ideal of every lawyer
in this profession.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,720
Battabi!

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,160
Battabi!

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,680
Battabi!

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,440
Just like earthquake sinks
into the ocean...

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,960
he shifted to Bangalore
after finishing...

22
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,920
all the cases of Hyderabad.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,680
His office will be opened tomorrow.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,240
Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,880
Sir, my name is Ranjit.

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,800
And she is my wife.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,400
Our sign of love...

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,160
our dream palace...

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,040
is Damayanthi Palace
which has been captured.

30
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,320
How to free it?

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,880
You are neither Ranjit
nor she is Damayanthi.

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,360
That means you guys aren't married.

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,240
That means you are acting to
get hold of that palace.

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,880
Hey, how do you know that?

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,080
Wouldn't I get to know
if you are lying?

36
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,880
I am not that dumb.
- Oh!

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,200
I have dealt with thousands
of such cases.

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,480
You know, everyone...

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,880
studies law after all.

40
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,640
I have ready every lines
of the law book.

41
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,280
Come on!

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,160
He is C. V. Rao.

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,480
He was the CEO of Gujarat's...

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,640
Google.

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,600
He can get you the green card
of America from here. - Oh!

46
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,560
He is Mr Murti.

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,320
Expert of false signatures.

48
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,080
He is the smartest when it comes
to preparing illegal documents.

49
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,040
This kid is S. N. Sharma.

50
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,840
It's a cup of tea for him
to find witnesses.

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,080
He is a bitch.

52
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,760
Here are the witnesses.
- Hello!

53
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,160
People believe
their lies to be the truths.

54
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,720
And he is...

55
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,880
Mathura Lal.

56
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,720
He has a beautiful name.

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,360
But works really hard.

58
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,600
Sir, your team is really good.

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,800
You can change injustice into
justice very easily.

60
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,160
Not for free. I charge money.

61
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,640
No matter if you are right,
if you claim she is your wife...

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,480
keep working till...

63
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,760
the operation is completed.

64
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,720
I'll try, sir.
- Please co-operate as well.

65
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,840
Act only if you feel comfortable.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Tell me clearly if...

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,680
you fall in love with me or...

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,560
you have any doubt.

69
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,160
And drop the topic.

70
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,040
There is no need of that.
I can act well.

71
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,600
Thank you, honey.
- Honey?

72
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,720
Who is honey?

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,280
Pet name of Damayanthi.

74
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,520
Honey!

75
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,760
What is this game?

76
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,200
Hmm? - The person
who touches it first, wins it.

77
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,440
Touch me, honey.

78
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,920
Honey! Touch me.
- Honey!

79
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,640
The person
who loses has to give a kiss.

80
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,080
Here it is. Have it.

81
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,080
What is this?' Upma' (Indian
food) made of Cashew.

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,480
Why so?

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,800
For our land, dear.

84
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,760
Have it.

85
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,200
That's nice.

86
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,000
Honey! I touched.

87
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,600
I was the first one.
- No, it was me.

88
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,640
I touched you first.

89
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,080
Honey, the person
who loses has to give a kiss.

90
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,200
Another spoon.

91
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,200
Honey, who is he?
Is he your relative?

92
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,640
Isn't he your relative?

93
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,560
Who are you all? How did you come
in without any permission?

94
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,120
You even came to have
the breakfast? - Sir...

95
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,520
the interior of
the house is perfect.

96
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,120
I became hungry while looking
at the interior...

97
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,960
so I started having the breakfast.

98
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,520
Will you rent this house?
- Hey, Pandit!

99
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,520
If they play like this,
the house will become a mess.

100
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,440
(Cross Talks)

101
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,120
Be careful.
- Get out!

102
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,800
Let's go!
- Careful!

103
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,120
If you have breakfast
at his place...

104
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,560
what else will he do
if not throw you out of the house?

105
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,320
We didn't go there to have
the breakfast. Take a look. - What?

106
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,640
Oh, no, come to the point.

107
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,720
We are legally going to
steal that palace.

108
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,680
Yes, towards right.
- What is this?

109
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,800
We are planning to bring
back the land...

110
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,960
which has been forcefully captured.

111
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,040
Madam will come close to me
along the process.

112
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,080
What if you lose?

113
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,760
I'll have her for
the rest of my life if I win.

114
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,480
If I lose,
I'll live with her memories.

115
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,880
The MLA is coming to meet our sir.

116
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,200
All the arrangements have
been made to welcome him.

117
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,160
MLA should be welcomed just
after he comes down from his car.

118
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,360
He should be praised.

119
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,760
You'll be paid according to
your performances. - Yes!

120
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,800
Let's go, sir.
- Right!

121
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
Sir, are you the MLA?

122
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,520
Yes, MLA.

123
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,960
A man with high ambition.

124
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,880
Victory, MLA!

125
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,680
Victory, MLA!

126
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,080
Victory, MLA!

127
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,560
I can't hear anything from the back!

128
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,760
Say it loudly.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,560
There is no rhythm!

130
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,160
Say it together. In the sync.

131
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,480
Who is this MLA?

132
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,960
He is asking me to speak in sync.

133
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,080
Hey, stop!

134
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,360
Who is this MLA?

135
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,280
Take out the garland.

136
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,360
When is our shooting?

137
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,040
We will shoot tomorrow.
Get out of here.

138
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,480
Such an amazing feeling.
I had goosebumps.

139
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,480
I understood
the fun of politics now.

140
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,600
I hate politicians.

141
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,920
Victory, MLA!

142
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Victory, MLA!

143
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,640
Victory, MLA!

144
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Sorry, sir. I got
the respect that you deserved.

145
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,400
People assumed me to be the MLA.

146
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,200
See you soon.

147
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,120
Both of you are close to
the Damayanthi palace.

148
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,960
If you want to communicate
visually...

149
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,640
you have to kiss Damayanthi.

150
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,200
What?
- I am ready.

151
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,360
Roll camera!

152
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,760
Action!

153
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Get inside!

154
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,360
Cut! Sir, I can't do
these things like this.

155
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,680
I'll kiss the green matt.

156
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,920
You are cheating...

157
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,440
and won't do it properly either.

158
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,560
Are you thinking...

159
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,280
that you will fall in love with him?

160
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,640
Do what has been said.

161
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,320
Cut!

162
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,640
How was the scene?

163
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,360
Oh, no!

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,360
It's really good, sir.

165
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,640
You got attached as if you caught
cold. Will you not leave me?

166
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,640
If you come to my house once...

167
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,560
I haven't grown up enough to go to
your home. Leave me.

168
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,240
I feel so sorry for Kalyan.

169
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,760
He loves you sincerely.

170
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,040
Don't be foolish, Smrita.

171
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,000
I can't love someone
for this sensitivity.

172
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,480
You know my condition.

173
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,920
Hmm.

174
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,880
Sir, stop!

175
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,040
Hello, sir. Please give me the bonus
of 'Diwali' (Indian festival).

176
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,240
Who are you?
- Sir, I sell vegetables.

177
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,360
You are watching it for
the last 4 years.

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,080
Okay, go!

179
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,120
Sir, is Mrs Honey not at home?

180
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,600
Honey is not yours but mine.

181
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,520
Who are you?

182
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,160
I press clothes.

183
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,840
The collar of your shirt was burnt.

184
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,360
That is why you stopped
giving me clothes.

185
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,960
Please talk to ma'am.
- Okay, I will. Leave!

186
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,800
"Every dots have started to match."

187
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:22,240
"All the evidence of
the crime have been found."

188
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,400
"The truth have been revealed."

189
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,960
"Nobody will be spared
in the court."

190
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,760
"The truth will be prevailed.
- It will be."

191
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,160
Your documents are ready.

192
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,600
"Everything will happen."

193
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,080
"The truth will be prevailed."

194
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,400
"The truth will be prevailed."

195
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,840
"The truth will be prevailed."

196
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,200
"It will happen."

197
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,280
"The truth will be prevailed."

198
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,640
Who captured here?

199
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,360
See, this belongs to him.

200
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,720
You and your wife have captured it.

201
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,360
That is why they filed a complaint.

202
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
This is the notice.

203
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,360
Who complained?

204
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,120
Tell me and I'll take care of him.

205
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,800
Honey, this is the sign of our love.

206
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,640
There shouldn't be
any violence in it.

207
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,920
We will win with honesty.

208
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,840
Nothing will happen with
honesty. - Hey!

209
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,960
No matter whatever we have captured.
This is honestly ours.

210
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,120
Everything is legal. We will fight
in the court. - Okay, sir.

211
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,560
How are you both related to each
other? - Wife and husband.

212
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,400
Where did you get married?

213
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,240
I asked where did you get married.

214
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,800
In the temple? In the church?

215
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,800
Or inside your home?

216
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800
Do you have
the marriage certificate?

217
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,760
At least, show us
the wedding photograph.

218
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,160
Even if we didn't get married...

219
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,920
we are going to get married soon.

220
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,600
Did you listen to them, your honor?

221
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,120
They aren't married.

222
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,640
But they are staying together.

223
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,800
Live in relationship.

224
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,960
What do they exactly want
to convey to the society?

225
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,880
Objection, your honor!

226
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,640
Do they have any proof if...

227
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,320
they are married?

228
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,520
What does the marriage
certificate say?

229
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,080
What does the ration card say?

230
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,440
What does the adhaar card
and the passport say?

231
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,400
The government believe that...

232
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,520
they are Mister and Mrs Ranjit
Singh. - It is possible.

233
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,240
But I have all the original
documents of the palace.

234
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,840
We too have the documents.
You can check.

235
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,520
These are the original documents.

236
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,920
Sir, this is my house.

237
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,280
You can ask
the people living in the colony.

238
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,840
The people are here.

239
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,200
Hello, red towel!
- Yes, sir.

240
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,160
Third row!

241
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,040
Not you. Sit down.

242
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,680
The one sitting besides.

243
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,880
Yes, you two. Come here.

244
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,560
Do you know him?
- He lives in my colony.

245
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,280
One of them is a vegetable seller
and the other presses clothes.

246
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,560
How long do you know them?
- Since 4 years.

247
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,680
Oh!

248
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,880
Then tell me...

249
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,280
who owns the Damayanthi palace.

250
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,840
He can never be the one.

251
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,480
But he is the owner of
the Damayanthi palace.

252
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,600
Hey, why are you lying?

253
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,400
It was 'Diwali' (Indian festival)
when you came at my home.

254
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,880
I understood.

255
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,400
They belongs to their team.

256
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,080
Your honor, I never saw them.

257
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,760
Note this point, your honor.

258
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,040
He just claimed that he knows them
since 4 years.

259
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,480
Now he claims that
he doesn't know them.

260
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,600
That means you didn't
see them either.

261
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,360
Honey, if we agree,
we will be trapped.

262
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,720
We will say that we didn't see them.

263
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,240
No, we didn't.

264
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Your honor...

265
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,080
On the 17th day of this month...

266
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,240
check the CCTV footage
of that place.

267
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,760
Did you see, your honor?

268
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,160
When my client was having
'Upma' (Indian food)

269
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,160
he kicked him out of
the palace forcefully.

270
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,600
Everything is a trap. They came
to ask for rent of that palace.

271
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,400
Does the people wanting rent
has 'Upma' (Indian food)?

272
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,640
Who else do you want to trick?

273
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
Your honor...

274
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,080
it is clear that...

275
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,600
every witness has been created
by Mr Bhattabi.

276
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,800
If he is truly
the owner of this house...

277
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,200
he must be having
the footage of the past as well.

278
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,120
Let's check.

279
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,360
Show us.

280
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,520
Huh?

281
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,280
"Justice will be prevailed."

282
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,720
"Justice will be prevailed."

283
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,160
"Justice will be prevailed."

284
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,480
"Justice will be prevailed."

285
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,960
"Justice will be prevailed."

286
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,240
"Justice will be prevailed."

287
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,240
How would you explain that?

288
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,520
Did I shoot them and changed
the CCTV footage of the palace?

289
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,000
Yes, you did everything.

290
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,680
Your honor, let me tell you...

291
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,000
I captured his land.

292
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,440
That is why they are
trying to capture...

293
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,120
my palace by pretending
they are married.

294
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,080
Oh, so, this was the actual plan.

295
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,240
'Now I have to save myself.'

296
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,800
Exactly, your honor.

297
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,440
Ranjit...

298
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,880
capture the property of
their company...

299
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,520
and wounded all
the people who tried to interfere.

300
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,120
Huh?
- Yes.

301
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,520
He wounded them brutally.

302
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,520
To tell them what it costs
to capture the property...

303
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,800
I made the false witnesses
say the truth...

304
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,160
so that my client gets the property.

305
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,960
So that justice is prevailed...

306
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,840
I had to choose the path of lie.

307
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,840
Did you get it?

308
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,080
Thank you, your honor.

309
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,520
Yes!

310
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,440
The criminal has admitted
his mistake.

311
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,600
And he has to return the land...

312
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,800
he captured.

313
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,240
The court decides that
the people involved in the case...

314
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,200
should be imprisoned for 3 years.

315
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,440
Battabi!
