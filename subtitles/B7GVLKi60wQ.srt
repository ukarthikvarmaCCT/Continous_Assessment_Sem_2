1
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,000
This is the story of :
"Mr. Sharma and Mr. Verma"

2
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,560
One is smart while the other is stupid

3
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,360
"Mr. Sharma is careful."

4
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,640
"Mr. Verma falls in
trouble every now and then."

5
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,360
"Mr. Sharma does long term planning."

6
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,480
"Mr. Verma does not
think of too far ahead."

7
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,840
"So what do you think,
who do you want to be?"

8
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,240
"Mr. Sharma or Mr. Verma?"

9
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,720
"Think now, act now."

10
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,080
"Invest in smart savings
plan and secure your future."

11
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,920
"Be a Sharma."

12
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,880
I don't know.

13
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,280
Something is missing in this ad.

14
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,960
We will finalize the logo by tomorrow.

15
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,240
Is it the color..
- I don't know.

16
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,160
I can't put my finger on it.
- Okay.

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,040
Is it the.. design.. - Anyway,
let me think about it on my flight.

18
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,200
And I will let you
know when I get to Delhi.

19
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,880
But Vineet please, we need

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,880
We are already
running behind schedule.

21
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,280

Call Vineet from Trikaya.

43
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,840
Actually, forget it.
I will do it myself.

44
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,960
Ask my driver to bring the
car to the porch. - Yes, ma'am.

45
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,160
Lower the volume

46
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,960
Yes.

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,840
Yes, on the way.

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,160
Airport.

49
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,240
We'll have to cancel the party.

50
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,920
No, I have to go to LA on Sunday.

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,960
Yes, it's preponed.

52
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,160
Yes, you also know how it is.

Okay, we'll talk about
it when we meet. Okay.

54
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,640
Okay, see you.

55
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,800
Love you. Bye.

56
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,320
Aunty, aunty, give me Rs.2.

57
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
I want to eat something.
I'll eat some food.

58
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,880
Please, aunty.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Aunty, what's that on the television?

60
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,360
Aunty, what's that on the television?

61
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,400
Look, remember we saw it back there..

62
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,680
..it is on the TV now.

63
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,960
Sweetheart, may you
get a handsome husband

64
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,200
Give us some money, come on!

65
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,760
Give it.

66
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,040
Cheapskate.

67
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,040
Blow the horn.

68
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,200
Oh, my! I don't believe this.

69
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,320
These are the worst kind of people.

70
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,240
Sorry.

71
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,960
Come on.

72
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,080
Let's go, let's go.

73
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,720
What the..

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Constable.
- What is it?

75
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
What is the problem? The traffic
is jammed from both the ends.

76
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,480
Madam, the traffic jam
is going to get worse.

77
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,720
A huge rally is going to pass by.
- Rally?

78
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,920
Yes.
- But I am getting late.

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,240
I am sorry, madam, but everyone
will have to take a diversion.

80
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,400
Okay.
- What?

81
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,160
Everyone! Take the lane to your left.

82
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,160
Great.

83
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,720
'Welcome to Chhatrapati
Shivaji Airport..' - Your ID, please.

84
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,520
Sorry.

85
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,400
Excuse me, please. Sorry.

86
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,040
Ma'am, please. Do you mind?

87
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,720
Please. Please.
- Are we standing in the line for fun?

88
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,520
Flight to Delhi.
- Ma'am, you have missed your flight.

89
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,720
That's not possible, check it.

90
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,200
Sorry, ma'am, but
the gates are closed.

91
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,400
I can't help you.

92
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,560
You are late.

93
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,160
What do you mean by I am late?

94
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,560
Sorry, ma'am, airline rules.

95
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,040
Airline rules!

96
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,720
Do you know how much
business I give your airline?

97
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,720
Me alone!
- I really can't help you, please.

98
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,640
When is the next flight?
- 11 o'clock at night.

99
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,840
What?

100
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,480
Listen, I need to go right now.

101
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,520
Aren't there any flights before that?

102
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,840
Not before 11 o'clock.

103
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,720
Only if you want to
travel by any budget airlines.

104
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,480
Budget airlines.

105
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,600
One outlook money please

106
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,800
Rs.30, madam.

107
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,840
No change, madam.

108
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,680
You must have. Check again

109
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,800
I really don't have change ma'am

110
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,600
How much?
- For 1000.

111
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,720
Just a minute.

112
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,480
Here is your change, ma'am.

113
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,400
You are welcome.

114
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,040
25.

115
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,960
Do you want a different magazine?

116
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,240
Will they get married?

117
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,480
What do you think?

118
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,760
Saif-Kareena.

119
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,600
How would I know

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,600
Well, If we don't know..
Why waste money on this magazine?

121
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,760
Sir, you should have
checked-in the bags.

122
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,280
But why, they're not that large!

123
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,200
And check-in or cabin, finally
all are going to reach Delhi.

124
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,480
What's the big deal. Relax.

125
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,360
Yes, hello.

126
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,800
I have already boarded.

127
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,200
No, keep talking.

128
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,280
I am only traveling by
the plane, not flying it.

129
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,520
Yes.

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,080
What?

131
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,200
I said 15 and not 12.

132
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,120
How much? Yes.

133
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,120
Tell that boy we are
here to do business..

134
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,320
..and not to waste time.

135
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,320
And we are not scared of him.

136
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,560
Tell him that's the final rate.

137
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,120
And also add that 'no
room for discussion' clause.

138
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,560
Yes.

139
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,040
Useless.

140
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,200
These Mumbaikars think
we Delhilites are fools.

141
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,360
So? Delhi?
- Delhi.

142
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,600
"..and pay attention to us."

143
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,280
"During the flight you.."

144
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,560
That's a nice shirt. Is it readymade?

145
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,000
Must be. Who gets
clothes tailored nowadays?

146
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,760
'Fasten your seat belts.'

147
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,440
'And follow our instructions.'

148
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,760
Forget it.

149
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,640
When our lives are in danger..

150
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
..she will be the first one
to jump out with her tray.

151
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,960
And we'll be searching for
the front door, middle door..

152
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,840
..and back door and
reach the heaven's door

153
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,360
Heaven's door. Front door.. Get it?

154
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,680
'It will come down from the
panel above..' - That's okay.

155
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,240
'..and the effect of oxygen..'

156
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,360
Have you ever tried the oxygen mask?

157
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,920
Gives a nice high.

158
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,720
The mind feels light.

159
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,320
Try it sometime.

160
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,960
So I explained to my wife,
"What are you so concerned about?"

161
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,760
"You mind your own business."

162
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,800
"As far as uncle is concerned,
there is nothing to worry about."

163
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,760
"We will lay a mattress on the
terrace next to the parapet."

164
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,800
Where?
- Parapet

165
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,600
No, on the terrace.

166
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,960
Do you want to get uncle killed..

167
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,640
..by hanging him from
the 30 feet high parapet?

168
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,280
You aren't paying attention

169
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,760
What do you do? You're in a
job or run your own business?

170
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,560
I am at.. the IIT..
- so you're still studying.

171
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,800
That's why you're
not paying attention.

172
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,240
Passengers are requested not
to open their seat-belts..

173
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,560
.. and stay at their seats..

174
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,520
..till the plane comes to a
complete halt. - Hold this.

175
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,880
See you.

176
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,840
Yes, hello.
- Excuse me, sir, please be seated.

177
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,440
What's the big deal.

178
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,560
We've landed after all.
- Yes, Hello.

179
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,960
I have just landed. Where are you?

180
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,760
'Flight IT8..'

181
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Vikram, I can't go on Monday.

182
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,680
But if it's my birthday and
I don't want to do anything..

183
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,400
..then I just don't
seem to understand..

184
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,960
Listen, hold on.
That's my bag. I'll call you.

185
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,760
Okay, I have got my bag.

186
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,240
Yes, I am coming out.

187
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,040
The battery is very low

188
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,680
I will see you there.

189
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,200
Yes, I am coming out. At exit no..

190
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,880
Welcome to Jaipur
International airport.

191
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,360
Welcome to Jaipur
International airport.

192
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,160
I am in Jaipur!

193
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,440
Vikram, I am in Jaipur!

194
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,640
I don't know, let me call you back.

195
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,360
I realized after
I landed at the airport here.

196
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,200
I don't know, there's some
major technical problem..

197
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,720
..or something like that,
at the Delhi airport.

198
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,480
All the flights are landing in Jaipur.

199
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,680
It's freezing here.

200
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,920
They did make the announcement..

201
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,280
..but I was asleep on the flight.

202
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,760
Hang on a minute.

203
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,680
It's freezing.

204
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,960
Listen, don't worry.

205
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,960
I will hire a car and come to Delhi.

206
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,640
Because there is no
other choice, Vikram.

207
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,520
There are no other
flights till morning.

208
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,520
Vikram, don't get
over-protective on me now.

209
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,760
I can't handle it.

210
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,200
I am hanging up now.
My battery is down.

211
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,360
Okay.

212
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,960
What happened?

213
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,160
Madam, the machine has broken down.

214
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,520
The card isn't working.

215
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,760
You will have to pay cash.

216
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,800
The plane is not working.

217
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,240
Your machine isn't working.

218
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,040
Is everyone's mind working?

219
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,440
That's working properly.

220
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,600
How much?
- 4000.

221
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,400
Here.

222
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,080
This is three..
- Wait.

223
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,880
Will do.

224
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,920
Here, the receipt to your car.
- Thank you.

225
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,720
You will find it in the parking
lot behind the second gate. Yes.

226
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,240
Okay.
- Madam. Greetings.

227
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,480
Welcome to my land.

228
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,600
Like there was a choice!

229
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,280
See you.

230
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,520
Excuse me.

231
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,800
I have to go to Delhi.

232
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,360
How long will it take to reach Delhi?

233
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,160
Six hours.
- What?

234
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,200
Six hours.

235
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,160
And if you drive faster?

236
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,720
This is my speed.

237
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,600
For the past 11 years.
- Very good.

238
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,040
Hey, what are you doing?

239
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,360
I haven't slept for
the past 32 hours, madam.

240
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,160
I have been driving non-stop.

241
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,560
What choices do the poor have?

242
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,320
Just keep toiling hard all day long.

243
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,120
Look, will you be
able to drive safely?

244
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,400
Or should I hire another car?

245
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,920
Hire another car.
- What?

246
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,160
Are you crazy?

247
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,000
You cannot do that.

248
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,000
You hire another car..

249
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,000
..and I will take another fare.

250
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,600
Where would you like to go, mister?

251
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,400
How dare you speak to me like this!

252
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,400
Look, I will file
a complain against you, okay?

253
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,920
Start the car.

254
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,080
You took the money, didn't you?

255
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,440
So do I owe you my life!

256
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,160
Madam, its you! Are you okay?
- What okay?

257
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,000
I hired this car to go to Delhi.

258
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,240
And now he's saying he won't go.

259
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,400
He's saying, "Hire another car".

260
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,520
You said so yourself.

261
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,760
Sir, where do you want to go?

262
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,200
Are you drunk?

263
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,040
Come here.

264
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,760
Why don't you take her?

265
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,240
You can't force me to.

266
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,600
It's my car.
I decide who I want to take

267
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,960
Or not take.

268
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,000
It sure is your car,
but I've hired it.

269
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,160
You talk as if you've bought it.

270
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,200
One call can make you rot in jail.

271
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,120
Don't you know how to talk to a lady?

272
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,400
Go ahead.

273
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,000
You too slap me.

274
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,080
The entire world can do
whatever they want with the poor.

275
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,760
I will crush your jaw
with a single punch.

276
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,280
Then you can drive your car in
the reverse gear all your life.

277
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,480
No, please, don't.. don't argue.

278
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,800
Don't worry, I know how
to deal with such rascals.

279
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,360
Why won't you go? Start the car.

280
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,640
I will come along as well.

281
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,160
Don't worry.

282
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,400
Let's go. Delhi.

283
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,760
Don't worry, I am coming along.

284
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,280
Come on. Now just drive the car.

285
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,240
And don't even dare to stop the car..

286
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,800
..or your breathing
till we reach Delhi.

287
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,880
But.. - Actually the Roadways'
bus is running late by two hours.

288
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,320
So I thought he will stay in control..

289
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,880
..if there's a man with you.

290
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,760
But you'll have to pay extra fare.

291
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,680
There you go again!

292
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,040
Should I remove my belt?

293
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,800
You.. you can just drop
me on the way. - Where?

294
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,200
There.. on the way,
near Chandni Chowk. - What?

295
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,240
Are you from Delhi?

296
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,680
Are you from Delhi?

297
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,320
No.

298
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,840
Why?

299
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,760
Does everyone traveling to
Delhi have to be from there?

300
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,920
You're right.

301
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,680
He could be from Kashmir as well.

302
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,960
My husband is.
- From Kashmir?

303
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,840
Delhi.
- I see. Delhi.

304
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,480
Where in Delhi?

305
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,840
Chanakyapuri.
- Chanakyapuri.

306
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,160
Where in Chanakyapuri?

307
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,440
Ninth main.
- Ninth main.

308
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,400
Where in Ninth main?

309
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,720
Bungalow no. 44, have you been there?

310
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,720
Bungalow no. 44, Ninth main,
Chanakyapuri, Delhi. No.

311
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,480
I have never been there.

312
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,720
Do you want to get us
killed at this young age?

313
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,040
Open your eyes. He was dozing off.

314
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,080
Stop the car. Stop the car.

315
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,040
Don't worry, I have travelled
between Delhi and Jaipur many a times.

316
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,960
I can drive on this
road with my eyes shut.

317
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,720
Even he was driving
with his eyes shut.

318
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Sit properly.

319
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,080
You get worried very easily.

320
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,000
It's not your fault.

321
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,320
Those who belong to New Delhi
are the nervous sorts.

322
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,200
I am from Old Delhi myself.

323
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,000
You must have heard of Chandni Chowk.

324
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,640
The 'Gurdwara' (Sikh Temple)
there is very famous.

325
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,880
That's where my home is.

326
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,200
But I work in Karol Baug.

327
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,520
It takes me 11 minutes everyday..

328
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,680
..to reach Karol Baug on my scooter.

329
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,120
I have my own shop.

330
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,920
Ladies' dress material and saris.

331
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,320
I mean American silk, Indian silk,
Dhaka Silk, georgette..

332
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,040
..poplin, you name it!

333
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,040
Retail and wholesale. Both.

334
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,440
It's in the alley in front
of Nathuram Confectioners.

335
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,120
Incase you want to drop by someday

336
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,440
Which alley?
- Nathuram Confectioners.

337
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,800
No, the alley in front of it..
- Please look ahead and drive.

338
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,560
Only if this guy lets me.

339
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,480
Sit properly.

340
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,400
Madam, I was wondering..
if you don't mind..

341
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,320
What do you do?

342
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,560
I'm into banking.

343
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,960
Bank. Which bank?
- What do you mean?

344
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,840
I mean the bank that you work in..

345
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,840
..which bank is it?

346
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,400
It's not like you think.
It's investment banking.

347
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,880
Securities.
- I see. I get it.

348
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,760
You must be posted in
the head office branch.

349
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,680
No.

350
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,280
You know what? Forget it.

351
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,800
I get it.

352
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,720
You must be thinking..

353
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,400
..that how can this
man from Chandni Chowk..

354
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,920
..understand about banking?
- I don't mean it like that.

355
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,360
No, no, it's okay.

356
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,200
By the way, madam,
I am not like I seem to be.

357
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,640
I am more cunning than a 'Lomdi'.

358
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,680
'Lomdi'. Wolf.
- Fox.

359
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,120
Fox, wolf, same family.
They are cousins.

360
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,280
Its okay if you don't want to tell me.

361
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,120
If that's so, then let me tell
you in detail what I do. - Okay.

362
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,320
Basically, we help in the capital
formation of businesses.

363
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,880
By the way of outright
purchase or security sales..

364
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,880
..which the issuer offers.

365
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,000
We do this through
standby or separate selling..

366
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,480
..to the US market
specializing in dollar investments.

367
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,440
Got it.
- I got it.

368
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,520
It means our professions are similar.

369
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,360
Investment banking and poplin?

370
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,640
Look, you sell American dollars..

371
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,960
..and I sell American georgette.

372
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,320
Isn't it?
- Now I have heard it all.

373
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
Music.

374
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,200
Which music do you listen to?

375
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,040
I know, you must
listen to English music.

376
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,240
I can say that just looking at you.

377
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,920
"Moments alive just passing you by"

378
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,880
"And you know that its cupid's time"

379
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,840
"Because its never coming back"

380
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,560
"Just gone a flight"

381
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:21,040
"Last time is beating,
time is beating, time is beating."

382
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,720
How far have we reached?

383
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,760
You woke up.

384
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,320
Seems like you are used to
falling asleep on journeys.

385
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,640
Where are we?
- Actually we just crossed Shahpura.

386
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,920
We'll soon be reaching Behrol.

387
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,720
Then Dharuvera then Gurgaon.

388
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,680
Shahpura?

389
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,240
We are headed to Ajmer!
- Ajmer.

390
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,440
No chance! Why would we go to Ajmer?

391
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,360
Please ask someone.
- Don't worry.

392
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,440
Just relax and sit comfortably.

393
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,720
Two hours later you will be
comfortably sitting on your bed..

394
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,560
..and watching television.

395
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,960
But why haven't we
crossed the Behrol bridge yet?

396
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,640
And where did this
rough patch come from

397
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,920
It says Mumbai 950 kilometers.
Where are we going?

398
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,760
You are driving
in the opposite direction. - No chance.

399
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,160
Why would I drive in
the opposite direction?

400
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,160
I took a diversion 10 kilometers back.

401
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,680
I took a big u-turn and
then two small u-turns.

402
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,280
You are heading in the
opposite direction. - By God!

403
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,520
They've changed all the
roads in the past two years.

404
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,640
Mark my words..

405
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,040
..this government won't
last for long. - Be quiet.

406
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,320
Just shut up.

407
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,240
Excuse me. Hey, you.

408
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,760
Driver.

409
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,720
What is his name?

410
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,040
Shivrattan

411
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,040
Wake him up.

412
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,920
Hey, get up.
Madam is asking something.

413
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,480
Oh honey! why are you getting annoyed?

414
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,360
What happened?
- What are you blabbering? Wake up.

415
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,760
This man is taking us
somewhere else all together!

416
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,960
Where am I taking you? All
of us are going to Delhi.

417
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,440
You just stop the car. Stop it.

418
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,520
What's the big deal.

419
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,880
Where are we? - Just a minute,
madam. I will find out.

420
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,160
God!

421
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,760
This is the worst
car I've traveled in.

422
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,080
What is he doing?

423
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,080
Is he serious?

424
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,560
Seems like he used to
drive a steamroller before.

425
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,880
You be quiet!

426
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,800
What? Where are we?
- I don't know, madam.

427
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,120
He said, "I have been
driving for 11 years".

428
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,480
So? You have been driving for
the past 11 years, haven't you?

429
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,320
I used to drive on the
Shimla-Manali road, madam.

430
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,200
Why am I not surprised?

431
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,840
Why are you asking this fool?

432
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,560
He was sniffing the road.

433
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,120
Get in the car

434
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,600
Don't worry, madam.

435
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,480
We've only lost our way, that's all.

436
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,840
What's the big deal.

437
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,960
It will start right now.

438
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,920
Yes, hello? Vikram, I..

439
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,360
What?

440
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,000
No. Not now.

441
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,720
God, I can't believe this.

442
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,480
What happened?

443
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,000
The battery is dead.

444
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,200
So what's the big deal! Use my phone.

445
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,800
Take it.

446
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,640
Talk. Go on.

447
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,440
I will go take a look.

448
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,440
Bablu, I suggest that
you check the carburetor.

449
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,200
That's where the problem always is.

450
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,440
Your theory would have
been helpful in the 1980s

451
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,640
A car with fuel-injection
system doesn't have a carburetor.

452
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,880
It doesn't!

453
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,040
That's why it broke down.

454
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,320
Our car broke down.

455
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,200
Vikram, don't get hyper.

456
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,640
No, I will be there. You stay put.

457
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,360
I'll call my friend.

458
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,840
He will come and fix it.

459
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,480
He is a mechanic.
- When will he come?

460
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,800
He will be here in 1-11/2 hour.

461
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,400
Want some?

462
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,520
I just called to tell you that..

463
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,640
..it can take a little longer, okay?

464
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,080
Just relax, we are fixing it.

465
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,760
Okay, I am hanging up. See you. Bye.

466
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,280
Thank you.
- Welcome.

467
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,880
Is it fixed? - very soon.
I showed the fool how to do it.

468
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,160
Don't worry, here, take a bite.

469
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,440
This snack clubbed with red
chilly pickle is my specialty.

470
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,680
Ready to eat in two seconds.

471
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,560
Noodles still take
two minutes to prepare.

472
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,680
I am not hungry.

473
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,600
How much longer will it take?

474
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,720
Around 1-11/2 hour.
- What?

475
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,560
For the mechanic to arrive.

476
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,800
Mechanic?
- What's the big deal.

477
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,400
There's a problem with the carburetor.

478
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,880
Bablu has called his friend.

479
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,400
Bablu, our driver.

480
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,120
I named him that.

481
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,600
What are we going to do
for one and a half hours?

482
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,000
Great.

483
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,400
It's been resolved.

484
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,080
Now.. we travel by
truck to Delhi, is it?

485
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,920
Not all the way to Delhi, but at
least Dharampal will drop us..

486
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,760
..to an inn ahead.

487
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,600
It's the truck driver's name.

488
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,200
I don't know.

489
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,640
I swear that's his name.

490
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,640
I asked him. Dharampal.

491
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,760
I don't know whether I
want to go by a truck or not.

492
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,800
I will wait here.

493
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,800
Here? What will you do here
for 11/2 hour in this cold?

494
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,960
And with this fool.

495
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,760
I suggest that you come along.

496
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,440
We will go there and give him a call.

497
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,360
..and tell him where to get the car.

498
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,680
And we can have dinner as well.

499
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,080
Come on. Come along.

500
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,560
Come on, madam. Come.

501
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,480
I've left all my luggage in the car.
You think it'll be safe there?

502
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,160
You are getting worried unnecessarily.

503
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,920
Your luggage will be absolutely safe.

504
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,720
Three of my bags are there as well.

505
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,320
Bablu will bring them along.

506
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Just relax.
- Right.

507
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,480
First time.. in the truck.
- Yes.

508
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,200
It's quite high.
- High and safe.

509
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,400
Isn't that so, Dharampal?

510
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,960
This vehicle has the pride
of a king, isn't that true?

511
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,720
Rules over the roads

512
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,280
There goes a tiny tempo..

513
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,160
And there goes that ant sized scooter

514
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,080
It's been ten minutes.

515
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,120
You are absolutely quiet.

516
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,360
What's wrong?

517
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,840
Are you feeling shy of
the beautiful madam?

518
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,960
No, no, it's not that.
- then what is it?

519
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,560
Why don't you tell a
story of one of your journeys

520
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,200
Like the.. Modi's crazy companion.

521
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,720
It was a show on the radio.

522
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,480
What did it come on?

523
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,960
Radio.
- Yes.

524
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,000
What story should I tell you, sir?

525
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,240
Tell me anything. A story
will make the time fly by.

526
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,360
Once I was driving on
the UP-Patna highway.

527
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,120
And a diesel tanker was lying
toppled in the middle of the highway..

528
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,720
..after ramming into a buffalo.

529
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,160
My truck crushed him.

530
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,360
And his neck came
under my truck's tires.

531
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,760
You mean the entire head.
- Oh, no, the head was gone.

532
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,760
Both his horns sank in his body.

533
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,640
And there were streams of blood.

534
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,040
Just like that.

535
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,040
He died on the spot.

536
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,240
The veins in the neck
must have been severed.

537
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,640
I don't know. - Once I saw an
ovine being slaughtered like that.

538
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,040
You do know what an
ovine is, don't you? Sheep.

539
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,480
Actually the butcher's
knife wasn't sharp enough.

540
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,840
He gave a single blow.

541
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,360
And his head hung like this.

542
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,800
It's okay, you can throw it out.

543
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,480
You think so.

544
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,120
How much?

545
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,400
Let it be, madam.

546
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,480
Why are you embarrassing me?

547
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,160
My wife is pregnant.

548
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,480
Just pray that everything goes well.

549
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,960
You are giving such big news now.

550
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,960
Sly guy.

551
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,120
I..

552
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,960
Let's..
- Dharampal.

553
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,440
Yes. - Do you always listen
to English songs on the radio?

554
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,160
No, madam.

555
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,080
I played it for you.
- For me?

556
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,960
Yes. I thought you must
listen to English songs.

557
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,840
And she thought you listen to them.

558
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,400
Okay, God bless you.

559
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,080
Call me and tell me what happened.

560
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,120
If it's a girl I'll distribute sweets.

561
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,360
Come on, jump.

562
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,680
You must have never jumped
from a truck before today.

563
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,440
All the best. - Thank you.
- Okay, Dharampal, I will call you.

564
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,720
That's so sweet.

565
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,000
And I was wondering..

566
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,600
..since when did truck drivers
start listening to English music?

567
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,440
Careful.

568
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,680
Are you okay?
- Ya.

569
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,560
You're wearing very high heels.

570
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,040
I was wondering..

571
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,520
..why do women wear such high heels?

572
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,640
But these heels are not
meant for walking on these roads.

573
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,160
Don't mistake this road to
be an ordinary one, madam.

574
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,800
I have heard that people
come here in their Mercedes..

575
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,160
..to eat at this inn. Potatoes
with ladyfinger, potatoes with cumin..

576
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,280
..potatoes with egg plant, potatoes
with fenugreek, potatoes with..

577
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,640
..cauliflower, peas
and cottage cheese and..

578
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,040
..they even have cold drinks.

579
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,960
So, madam, what will you have?

580
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,200
Anything.
- Anything?

581
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,800
"Anything" isn't
available in this menu.

582
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,840
You will have something.

583
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,000
Anything will do as
long as its not very oily.

584
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,480
Which I guess is asking
for too much in this place.

585
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,640
Lets see..

586
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,320
Son. Yes. Come here quickly.

587
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,600
Oh, thank you.
- Great.

588
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,760
He brought a blanket for us.

589
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,600
What is your name?
- Sunny.

590
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,240
Sunny.

591
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,720
Great, Sunny.

592
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,040
Do one thing. Do you eat non-veg?
- No, I don't.

593
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,880
Oh no! Do one thing.

594
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,080
We'll have two plates of Dal,
Two plates of potato with cumin,

595
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Two plates of chick pea curry

596
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,520
two plates of yoghurt salad

597
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,080
And four flatbreads to start with.

598
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,040
Smear the breads with lots of butter.

599
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,760
No, do one thing. Butter two nicely,

600
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,040
And just put a dollop of
butter on the other two. Got it?

601
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,240
That's too much. - But I am so
hungry I could eat an elephant!

602
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,360
And listen. Sunny, right?

603
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,840
Do you see the lady?

604
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,720
She is from Mumbai.

605
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,360
She works in movies, she's an actress.

606
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,880
You must have seen her on television,
haven't you?

607
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,600
If she's pleased with your service..

608
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,280
..she will take you to Mumbai.

609
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,800
And cast you as a hero in her
upcoming film "sky full of stars"

610
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,040
In which film?
- She'll cast me as a hero?

611
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,720
What hero? I'm
saying "sky full of stars"

612
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,480
Go, get the food. Yes.

613
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,240
Go quickly.

614
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,760
What was that stupidity?

615
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,800
You wont understand.

616
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,720
Just watch how well they serve us now.

617
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,880
By God!

618
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,080
Next time you want good service..

619
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,200
..don't use my name, okay?

620
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,960
What's the big deal.

621
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,360
Son, turn the fan this way.
- Fan?

622
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,920
Let it be, it's cold.

623
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,760
Wow.

624
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,200
It's delicious.

625
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,640
What are you doing?

626
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,320
Wiping the bread.

627
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,640
You must have an oil-remover cream.

628
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,360
Apply that on the bread.

629
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,760
It's great, just great.

630
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,520
How is the food?
- It's okay.

631
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,240
Thank God.

632
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,480
You didn't taste the Chick pea curry.

633
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,680
It's too oily.

634
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,960
It's locally made butter.

635
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,120
It's very good for health.

636
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,280
Try some.

637
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,640
Eat it.
- Why did you serve it on my plate?

638
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,120
I hate people touching my plate.

639
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,520
Fine, don't eat it.

640
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,120
No one's forcing you.

641
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
What's the big deal

642
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,520
Great.

643
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,880
Great. That was delicious.

644
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,360
Why are you laughing?

645
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,680
Go get water, chilled water.

646
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,360
What happened?

647
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,520
My God.

648
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,280
Looks like armpit hair

649
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,000
I can't do this anymore.
- It's okay.

650
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,480
It's clean now after all the steaming
and boiling it's gone through.

651
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,840
Don't worry, just relax and eat.

652
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,800
Please call that driver.

653
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,120
Bablu.
- Yes.

654
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,800
He must have fallen asleep by now.

655
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,360
Give it to me.

656
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,880
Shankar, see if there's a snake.

657
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,680
Snake.

658
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,480
Cockroach.

659
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,320
Cockroach.

660
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,200
Just a minute.

661
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,120
There you go. It's dead.

662
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,400
Stop laughing everyone.

663
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,160
Madam is scared of cockroaches.

664
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,280
I am not used to all this.

665
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,080
And cockroaches are the worst things.

666
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,720
Shut up, enough of laughing.

667
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,760
You call him.

668
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,560
Your phone?

669
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,160
I gave it to you just now.
- Yes.

670
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,960
It must be right here.

671
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,880
Where did it go?

672
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,440
I am really very sorry.

673
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,720
I didn't realize how this
phone slipped from my hand and..

674
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,080
That's okay, it keeps falling.

675
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,360
It's still within the warranty.

676
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,280
Will it get repaired? I will get
it repaired once I reach Delhi.

677
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,600
Once it fell in the commode.

678
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,040
I thought it's gone for good.

679
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,440
But those people fixed it in two days.

680
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,400
How will we call the driver now?

681
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,880
I was thinking about the same thing.

682
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,200
Jhujhar Singh.
- Yes.

683
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,440
Can we find any transportation here?
Some scooter or anything.

684
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,640
We don't have a scooter,
but there is a bicycle.

685
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,880
Bicycle. Even that will do.

686
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,040
Should I ask him to fetch it?
- Yes.

687
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,400
Go, get the bicycle quickly.

688
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,520
Get it quickly.

689
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,320
Should I come along?

690
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,880
Where will you go? You sit
here comfortably and relax.

691
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,800
I will go find out.

692
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,440
Is it working?
- No, there is no sound.

693
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,560
Uncle.
- Yes.

694
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,400
Should I go along as well?
- Go on, son.

695
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,560
Come, come, climb on. Very good.

696
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,400
Don't you know how
to sit on a bicycle?

697
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,440
Yes, that's correct. Bravo.

698
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,480
Tell me.. why don't you go to school?

699
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,360
Do you want to clean
utensils all your life?

700
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,320
Tell your uncle to get
you out of this inn..

701
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,320
..and send you to school.

702
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,920
Send you where?
- To a school.

703
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,520
You're a smart kid.

704
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,560
"Mr. Sharma does long term planning."

705
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,520
"Mr. Verma does not
think of too far ahead."

706
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,320
"So what do you think,
who do you want to be?"

707
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,240
"Invest in smart savings
plan and secure your future."

708
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
"Be a Mr. Sharma."

709
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,640
It's bad manners.. to
stare at someone like that.

710
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,840
Shankar, you were going
to the loo, weren't you?

711
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,240
Go on. Go inside.

712
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,920
What was that sound?
- It's the wolf.

713
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,240
Wolf?
- Yes.

714
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,400
Wolf. Like a real wolf.
- Yes.

715
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,400
There's a jungle around.

716
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,800
They wander around.

717
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,760
Aren't.. aren't you scared?

718
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,600
There is nothing to be
worried about, madam.

719
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,360
They don't come up
unnecessarily like the snakes.

720
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,240
Snakes?
- Yes, snakes do come here.

721
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,520
And they come in large
numbers in the monsoons.

722
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,240
I saw one just the other day.

723
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,760
It was this long. it passed from here.

724
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,360
But those innocent
creatures don't hurt us.

725
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,640
Instead, they eat up
the mice in our inn.

726
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,000
How was the food madam?

727
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,040
Stop, stop.

728
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I must have lost
10 kilos of weight. I swear.

729
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,200
Jhujhar Singh.

730
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,120
Make some tea.

731
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,600
Where is the car?
- What?

732
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,280
The car?
- The car was towed away.

733
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,760
There was a leakage
in its fuel injection.

734
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,240
So they towed it away.
- Now?

735
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,680
Now what? We will hire another ride.

736
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,760
But.. how can they do that?

737
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,440
They should've sent another car.

738
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,960
That's right. But this is India.

739
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,400
You will have to go to
Delhi and lodge a complaint.

740
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,080
That's why I brought our luggage back.

741
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,080
Where is my bag?
- What?

742
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,920
My bag.
- Which bag?

743
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,160
My black suitcase.

744
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,760
Oh! That's what I kept
wondering on the way..

745
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,320
..what have I missed..

746
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,960
What?

747
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,760
You left my bag in the car.

748
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,960
What's the big deal, we
still have the receipt.

749
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,480
We'll call the car-owners and
they will deliver the luggage.

750
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,600
Receipt?

751
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,760
It was in the car.
- Really?

752
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,280
Did you take it?

753
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,480
But we do know.. the
name of the driver. - Bablu.

754
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,760
Yes.
- Wow.

755
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,960
What will I do with that name?

756
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,720
All my belongings were in that bag.

757
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,520
My clothes, my files, everything.

758
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,520
How can you do this?

759
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,520
You have only lost your belongings.

760
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,920
So what.

761
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,680
Things like these happen sometimes.

762
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,800
You shouldn't let it
bother you so much.

763
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,120
Because I believe
that the only thing..

764
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,240
.. that matters in life,
is life itself!

765
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,680
And we're still alive.

766
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,520
You are rinsing your mouth..

767
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,960
..with my French Alps Spring water?

768
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,400
So what's the big deal.

769
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,280
You're arguing with me
for a bottle of water.

770
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,440
I will buy you
another one. Jhujhar Singh.

771
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,080
Give madam two
litres of mineral water.

772
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,280
What's the big deal.
- What's the big deal!

773
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,800
What's the big deal!

774
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,960
What is a big deal for you?

775
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,640
When wolves come in and
attack us and eat us..

776
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,280
..that will be a big deal for you.

777
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,440
And you, madam.

778
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,800
Everything is bad news for you.

779
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,680
Even your good starts
with not too bad, you know.

780
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,760
That's it, I have had it.

781
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,040
You are the worst person
I have ever met. - Really?

782
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,920
What have I done?

783
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,760
What did you do?
- Yes, tell me, what have I done?

784
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,080
I missed my flight because of you.

785
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,240
Because of me?
- Yes.

786
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,280
You stopped your stupid
rickshaw at that green signal.

787
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,120
And then I had to forcefully
plug my ears on the flight..

788
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,040
..because of your non-stop blabbering.

789
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,960
I never realized when the flight
landed in Jaipur. - That's great.

790
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,160
You are accusing me for the
problems at Delhi airport.

791
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,000
And then he
forcefully barged in my car.

792
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,960
I took a lift for you..
- You drove in the opposite direction.

793
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,120
I took a lift for you.

794
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,280
For me?
- Yes.

795
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,680
So that.. That evil Bablu..

796
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,040
How could I have left a lonely
helpless woman with him alone?

797
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,200
What?

798
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,320
Lonely helpless woman?
- Yes.

799
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,760
Do you have any idea who I am?

800
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,840
This lonely helpless woman..

801
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,480
heads a company worth 200 crores.

802
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,360
635 employees report directly to me.

803
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,760
I wouldn't let fools like you..

804
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:33,200
..wander anywhere close to
my office's building compound.

805
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,800
Who wants to wander in
your office's compound?

806
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,400
And.. and I don't understand..

807
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,880
..how can so many
men work under a woman.

808
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,280
Of course, because for men like you..

809
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,280
..women should stay at home.

810
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,080
So that you can go
out and fool around.

811
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,920
I am fooling around.

812
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,640
Am I fooling around?

813
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,960
By the way, sister, my wife
stays at home the entire day as well.

814
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,720
But I didn't chain
her down, understand?

815
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,320
Do I look like a sister to you?

816
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,440
Oh! Well, now it seems
like it's a crime to call..

817
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,400
..a woman 'sister' in India !

818
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,800
Forget it.

819
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,880
You Mumbaikers won't
understand a Delhilite's feelings.

820
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,760
I know many Delhilites, okay?

821
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,880
But none of them eat
with their mouths open.

822
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,920
And they don't use abusive language.

823
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,920
That, too, in front of women.

824
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,480
Oh yes, if we say it
in Hindi, it's abusive..

825
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,520
..and if she says it in English,
that's acceptable

826
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,520
Just.. shut up.

827
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,360
Okay..

828
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,880
I think.. I yelled too much at you.

829
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,920
I mean I just..

830
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,600
Bablu was saying that Nua
station is 25 kilometers from here.

831
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,560
There's a train that leaves
for Delhi everyday from there.

832
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,760
We'll catch that in the morning.

833
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,960
Okay, thanks.

834
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,800
It's just that my
migraine had become severe.

835
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,760
And..

836
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,400
I just.. I just..

837
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,280
Excuse me.

838
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,520
What's the big deal!
It looks like armpit hair.

839
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,120
You're driving in
the opposite direction.

840
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,240
Ma'am you've missed your flight.

841
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,520
See if there is a snake!

842
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,080
Vikram, I am in Jaipur.

843
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,720
Jhujhar Singh was saying
that he has a camel-cart.

844
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,440
It will give us a lift to
a jeep. And from there..

845
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,040
What are you looking at?

846
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,560
It's so beautiful, right?

847
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,120
I've never seen such a sunrise.

848
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,640
What is so special about this sunrise?

849
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,760
Sunrise happens everyday

850
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,440
But you don't realize how
beautiful it is everyday.

851
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,040
And if I wasn't here with you, then..

852
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,160
..I would have never seen this.

853
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,120
And I am really sorry.

854
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,360
I yelled at you last night.

855
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,320
Actually I had got a bad migraine.

856
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,880
Its okay.

857
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,920
Sometimes, when we lose temper,
we blow our tops off.

858
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,960
Here, toothbrush.

859
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,360
But I have to confess.

860
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,640
Seeing you so worried, I was scared..

861
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,680
..that you might start crying.

862
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,800
I never cry.
- I never cry either.

863
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,600
I make people cry.
- And I make them laugh.

864
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,320
In fact, you know what you
should do when you feel like crying?

865
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,680
What?
- You should laugh out loud.

866
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,800
What rubbish!
- Believe me, it's true.

867
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,440
If you laugh at the sorrows..

868
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,760
..then they never bother you.

869
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,600
That's why whenever I feel
like crying, I laugh out loud.

870
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,960
Interesting.

871
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,200
Yes.
- Thank you.

872
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,920
If I don't get tea in the morning,
then I lose my mind.

873
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,280
Yes.

874
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,920
It reminds me, your headache..
- Migraine.

875
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,600
Yes, that. I have a
guaranteed cure for it.

876
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,760
A saint from the South gave it to me.
- I see.

877
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,640
Look.

878
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,600
Wow. What is this?

879
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,360
It's an ayurvedic ointment.

880
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,360
Flowers of henna are soaked in vinegar

881
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,480
And then mixed with elephant's poop..
- Okay, okay

882
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,640
It's a guaranteed cure.
- It might be.

883
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,520
But my head just got better
hearing of 'elephant poop'.

884
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,240
Thank you.
- As you say.

885
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,200
I am used to having heavy breakfast.

886
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,120
Will I get something here?
- That's more like it.

887
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,560
Shankar.

888
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,760
What's for breakfast?

889
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,760
Fried flatbreads and potatoes.

890
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,920
"He dreams with open eyes."

891
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,960
"our heart
- its crazy"

892
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,240
"the entire world has changed,
but it refuses to budge"

893
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,760
"He has gone crazy."

894
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,360
"He has gone crazy."

895
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,880
"All day long, he has fun"

896
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,760
"He has fun."

897
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,640
"He has fun."

898
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,280
"He has fun."

899
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,080
There's a "Nua" station,
I am taking a train from there.

900
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,080
Okay. Yes, I will be there.

901
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,240
Just meet me at Delhi
station at 2 o'clock.

902
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,160
Okay, fine.

903
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,080
It's the.. camel driver's phone.

904
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,520
Please, I will tell you later.

905
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,720
Okay, bye.

906
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,760
"There's restlessness in the heart."

907
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,200
"and yet its jumping with joy"

908
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,320
"sometimes it behaves itself"

909
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:34,680
At other times, it becomes naughty"

910
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,560
"There's restlessness in the heart."

911
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,040
"and yet its jumping with joy"

912
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,160
"sometimes it behaves itself"

913
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,040
At other times, it becomes naughty"

914
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:50,040
"He plays pranks openly."

915
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,840
"He has fun."

916
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,520
"He has fun."

917
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,960
"He has fun."

918
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,000
"He has fun."

919
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,000
"He wanders around aimlessly."

920
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:33,800
"Like a kite on the loose"

921
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,920
"He wanders around aimlessly."

922
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,200
"Like a kite on the loose"

923
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:50,040
Only God knows how we'll reach Delhi.

924
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,280
"He has fun."

925
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,000
"He has fun."

926
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,840
"He has fun."

927
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,040
"He has fun."

928
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,480
"He has fun."

929
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,960
"He has fun."

930
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,560
We have reached Nua station.
- Yes.

931
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,000
Finally.
- Yes.

932
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,280
I get hungry..
whenever I see a station.

933
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,280
I have already digested
the morning breakfast.

934
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,680
I suggest that we first go
and eat something.

935
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:32,160
No.. you go.. I'll take a leave.
- you're leaving?

936
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,160
Aren't we are
traveling to Delhi together?

937
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,680
No, I will take a first AC..
- First AC.

938
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,560
These first AC fares are too high.

939
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,280
Why are you going in first AC?

940
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,200
I suggest that it's a
three-four hour journey.

941
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,200
Let's travel in the general bogie.
- I know.

942
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,920
That's why I will buy my ticket..

943
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,080
..and you buy yours.

944
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,360
And anyway, my husband is
coming at the Delhi station. - Yes.

945
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,240
But how will you travel alone?

946
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,560
I can manage that much.

947
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,320
Okay.

948
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,840
And, I am really sorry..
for the phone. - That's okay.

949
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,560
What's the big deal.

950
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,280
I should be apologizing
for the water and your bag.

951
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,080
I am very sorry. For all
that I may have said or done..

952
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,040
And if you ever come to Karol Baug..

953
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,280
..then don't forget to drop in.

954
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,800
Do pay me a visit.
- Okay.

955
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,560
Yes.
- Okay. Goodbye.

956
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,720
First AC, Loharu express to Delhi.

957
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,920
One ticket please.

958
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,880
Madam, 324.

959
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,560
My money.

960
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,160
My.. my money.

961
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,280
Where did he go?

962
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,960
Hey, get something to eat.

963
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,240
Get something to eat.

964
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,000
Hey.
- You!

965
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,800
Hey!
- Come on.

966
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,760
Hey.
- You!

967
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,360
Hey.
- You!

968
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,560
Hey.
- You!

969
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,320
Hey!
- Come on.

970
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,480
Hey. My money is stolen.

971
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,720
Come on. Come on, come on.

972
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,520
Come on.

973
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,560
Come on.
- Hey!

974
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,400
Come on, come on.

975
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,560
Come on, come on.

976
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,780
Come on.

977
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,540
Come on, come on.

978
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,060
Someone cut my bag.

979
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,780
All my money has been stolen.

980
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,220
Yes.

981
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,600
Even yours?

982
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,440
Who's the fool?

983
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,040
Oh!

984
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,440
What job am I stuck in?

985
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,760
I should've worked in my
uncle's tractor agency.

986
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,760
I would've done much better with that.

987
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,280
Some fool pulled the chain.

988
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,760
That's only when
I get my hands on him.

989
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,440
See, he delayed the train.

990
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,360
Someone pulled the chain.

991
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,280
You did.

992
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,360
You are a disgusting person.

993
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,120
Don't you know that spitting at
public places is a criminal offence?

994
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,680
It's a bigger offence to pull
the chain and stop a moving train.

995
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,520
But if I hadn't done that you
wouldn't have boarded the train.

996
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,680
What if we are caught?
- No chance!

997
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,880
I pulled the chain from the AC bogie.

998
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,440
Didn't you notice, the TC is
searching for someone else?

999
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,680
Let's go, let's go.

1000
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,040
Will we get a place to sit?

1001
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,040
Where there is a will,
there is a seat.

1002
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,280
Come, come.

1003
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,600
Here, here, right here.

1004
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,520
It's a window seat, 56, sit, sit.

1005
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,200
Sit down.

1006
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,200
I don't have a ticket.
- What?

1007
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,040
I don't have a ticket.
- What?

1008
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,600
You don't have a ticket?

1009
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,200
I was just joking.

1010
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,040
That's alright.

1011
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,680
I have been traveling in
trains since I was 20 years old..

1012
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,040
..and I never bought a ticket.

1013
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,600
Never made any reservations.

1014
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,600
Direct setting with the TC.

1015
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,760
Don't worry, enjoy the view.

1016
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,960
But what if we have to pay a fine?

1017
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,360
You won't have to pay
any fine, I am there.

1018
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,960
Don't worry.

1019
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,680
Are you Bengali?

1020
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,880
How did you know?

1021
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,800
Looking at your
wife's dangling earrings.

1022
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,040
How else?

1023
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,680
Only Bengali ladies wear
such dangling earrings.

1024
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,600
Am I correct, sister?
- Yes, absolutely correct.

1025
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,040
What a beautiful sari!

1026
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,760
Is this a 'Tanth' sari?
- Yes, it's a 'Tanth' sari.

1027
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,520
They did the right thing.

1028
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,360
Changed Calcutta to Kolkata.

1029
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,360
You don't get the same
taste in 'Rasgulla'..

1030
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,760
..that you get in
'Rosogulla' (Bengali sweets).

1031
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,120
Isn't it?
- Yes.

1032
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,800
Now whenever we say Kolkata..

1033
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,760
..it feels like
someone's saying Calcutta..

1034
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,960
..with hot 'Rasgulla' in his mouth.

1035
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,440
Try it. Kol-kata.

1036
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,040
Why don't you try it?

1037
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,440
Hello, are you married?

1038
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,760
Do you.. have children?
- No kids.

1039
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:21,520
Oh, God, it's important to have kids.

1040
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,040
You must have kids.
- Yes, soon.

1041
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,440
Soon will make your life lonesome.

1042
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,440
She has been married for five years.

1043
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,600
I advise you that..

1044
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,880
..don't miss the happiness
of kids for your career.

1045
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:35,680
Because life may not always be kind,

1046
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,600
..but everything good
happens for a child.

1047
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,040
Who told you that I am career-minded?

1048
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,120
Just because I look like
this and I dress like this.

1049
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,520
You are arguing again.

1050
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,040
All okay?
- Yes, everything is okay.

1051
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,600
It's just that children
are a big responsibility.

1052
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,280
And I am not ready for it.

1053
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,600
And can I live my life on my terms?

1054
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,680
If you don't mind?
- I was talking about myself.

1055
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,200
I had two children in
two years of marriage.

1056
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,520
And I had planned for four.
- Four children?

1057
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,880
Oh, God. Your poor wife.

1058
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,280
She isn't poor.

1059
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,760
Vibha could make the
witches look kind!

1060
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,120
you don't know her.

1061
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,600
Aren't you ashamed?

1062
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,440
You are mocking your wife publicly.

1063
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,760
I am mocking my own wife and not his.

1064
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:23,680
Sister, you have two kids.

1065
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,800
Two sons. 'Rosogullas'. Very sweet.

1066
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,880
But don't mind me saying, the
joy of having a daughter is unique.

1067
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,120
Like the saying goes..

1068
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,040
I believe that a son is a
son till he gets a wife.

1069
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,360
But daughter is a daughter
till the end of life, right?

1070
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,200
By the way.

1071
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,360
Your pocket was picked
as well, isn't it? - Yes.

1072
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,440
Then how did you buy the ticket?

1073
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,600
You forgot the secret pocket.

1074
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,440
No thief can get there.

1075
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,040
I have stashed Rs.800 in there.
- What?

1076
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,860
I have stashed Rs.800 in there.

1077
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:05,100
Rs.800 in your secret pocket.

1078
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:15,180
"Let's go to Dilli."

1079
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,580
"Let's go to Dilli."

1080
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:24,100
"Let's go to Dilli."

1081
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:30,780
"Let's go to Dilli."

1082
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:41,780
"Life's so short, wonder
what will happen next moment."

1083
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,940
"Your journey is calling out to you."

1084
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,340
"Stop grieving."

1085
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,580
"Let's learn to be happy."

1086
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:52,660
"Catch this train that's departing."

1087
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:59,340
"Life's so short, wonder
what will happen next moment."

1088
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,580
"Your journey is calling out to you."

1089
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:03,940
"Stop grieving."

1090
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,180
"Let's learn to be happy."

1091
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:10,180
"Catch this train that's departing."

1092
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,860
"This is your world,
no matter how it is."

1093
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:17,020
"Why curse it?"

1094
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,420
"Let's live these golden moments."

1095
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,660
"The dawn has arisen."

1096
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,180
"Let's go to Dilli."

1097
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,260
"Let's go to Dilli."

1098
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,340
"Let's go to Dilli."

1099
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:38,660
"Let's go to Dilli."

1100
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:47,340
"Let's go to Dilli."

1101
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,940
Water. Water. Cold water.

1102
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:06,420
Which station is this?
- It's Jhunjunu.

1103
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,580
The 'Ghewars' (sweets)
from here are very famous.

1104
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:10,020
You must have
certainly eaten 'Ghewar'.

1105
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,860
How would you have eaten 'Ghewar'?

1106
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:17,020
This must be your life's first
train journey. - Of course not.

1107
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:18,700
I have traveled by train..

1108
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,180
..when I was nine years old.

1109
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,260
From Mumbai to Allahabad.
- I see.

1110
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,100
It was my uncle's wedding.

1111
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:29,100
We had a.. What do you call it?

1112
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:31,580
An entire coupe to ourselves.

1113
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:34,260
Fun and mischief all along the way.

1114
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,260
Eating something or
the other all the way.

1115
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,100
Then you will surely
like the 'Ghewars'.

1116
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:41,020
I will get it, do taste it.
- No, thanks.

1117
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,100
Goldie, you will eat it, won't you?

1118
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:44,260
Sister

1119
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,340
You will taste it, won't you?
- Yes, I will.

1120
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:47,780
I will be back soon.

1121
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,260
You taste it, too.
- No thanks.

1122
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,180
Papdi. Kachauri (snacks).
- Tea. Tea.

1123
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:54,340
Vada. Hot vadas (snacks).

1124
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,340
So.. how many did you sell today?

1125
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:00,260
Ticket. Ticket.

1126
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,020
Your Ticket.

1127
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,860
Ticket.

1128
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,420
Are the Jhunjhunwala's from your town?

1129
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,420
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1130
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,260
Madam is calling you.

1131
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,500
Come here. Come on.

1132
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:18,260
A while ago,
when I was praising your 'Ghewars'..

1133
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,500
..she was getting furious.

1134
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,700
Madam, your ticket.

1135
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,340
Now she wants them too.

1136
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:24,500
I suggest that you pack two kilos.
- Listen.

1137
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,500
Your ticket.

1138
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,660
Madam, your ticket.

1139
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:33,100
56 is yours?

1140
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:36,780
No..
- Actually, madam..

1141
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,020
Sir..

1142
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:40,340
Is she with you?
- No.

1143
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:43,340
No, he has gone out?
- Husband.

1144
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,340
No, colleague.

1145
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:48,260
He has the ticket?
- No, he doesn't have the ticket.

1146
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:49,500
That means you don't have a ticket,

1147
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:52,020
I suggest that you get down here,

1148
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,580
Come..
- Panth, sir.

1149
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,340
I was looking for you in S5.

1150
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:56,700
Would you like to have 'Ghewars'?

1151
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,580
Come on. Come on.
- Madam..

1152
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,420
She is with me. Come on.

1153
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,020
Papdi. Kachauri.

1154
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,580
Mr. Panth.
- No.

1155
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:06,860
What's the big deal.
- No.

1156
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,020
Hold this box.
- No. - Hold the box.

1157
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:12,660
Mr. Panth, can we travel by
train taking up enmities with you?

1158
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,180
You don't understand.
- We can never do it, Mr. Panth.

1159
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:16,780
You are our benefactor.
- Okay.

1160
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:19,700
Take.. the 'Ghewars'.

1161
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:21,340
Taste it.

1162
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,860
But I am diabetic.

1163
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,580
I can't eat too many sweets.

1164
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:28,580
It's done?
- Of course.

1165
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,580
He wasn't listening,
he was showing attitude.

1166
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:32,420
Later he took Rs.400.

1167
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,940
I will surely return this money
in Delhi.. - What are you saying?

1168
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,500
Can't I do this much
for my special customer?

1169
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,100
Customer?
- Remember !

1170
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:43,100
My sari shop at Karol Baug.

1171
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,940
Now wont you be buying saris from
my shop on birthdays, marriages..

1172
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,340
..and every special function.

1173
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:49,500
It's all marketing. Marketing.

1174
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:53,340
This is the level of this
corruption in this country. - Yes.

1175
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,940
Anyone can do anything with money.

1176
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:57,860
Nothing good can happen to India.

1177
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:59,340
How can it?

1178
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:00,860
When the train left from Nua station..

1179
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:03,180
..I boldly pulled the chain.

1180
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:05,100
But did anything happen?
Did anyone catch me?

1181
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:06,660
Did anyone harm me in anyway? No.

1182
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:08,340
I bought 'Ghewar'
at Jhunjhunu station..

1183
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,660
..and now I am
distributing it to everyone.

1184
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,500
The system, my friend. The system.

1185
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,020
The problem is with the entire system.

1186
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,500
That's why no one is
afraid of doing anything wrong.

1187
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:16,940
Look, just because
they get a uniform..

1188
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:18,660
..they think they
have got the license.

1189
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:22,340
From the police officials to
the TC, all of them corrupt.

1190
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,420
They have a rate card.

1191
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,180
They won't think twice before
selling their fathers for a bribe.

1192
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,500
Rascals.

1193
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:44,500
Inspector. Mr. Mishra.

1194
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:48,860
I was saying that we only
just pulled the train's chain..

1195
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,860
..and not a chain from a woman's neck.

1196
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:53,420
Don't you agree?
- Just a minute.

1197
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,260
What do you mean by that?

1198
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:01,500
Sir, I have the right
to make one phone call.

1199
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,260
You too will get a
chance to make a call.

1200
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:07,260
Seems like you watch a
lot of English movies.

1201
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,700
How.. is she related to you?

1202
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,940
She.. is a friend. Co-passenger.

1203
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,700
We boarded from Nua station..
- Yes.

1204
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,660
And..
- I see. Co-passengers.

1205
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,020
Yes.

1206
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:22,660
Look, you will have to
pay a hefty penalty.

1207
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,780
Uncle.
- Uncle?

1208
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:36,180
I only have Rs.500 left.

1209
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:40,020
If you could settle
the case with this..

1210
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,780
Rs.500 is no good.

1211
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:46,020
I have to maintain the entire office.

1212
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:49,020
Actually.. - This is no good.
Listen, listen to me.

1213
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,100
Someone picked my
pocket and hers, too.

1214
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:52,860
This won't do any good.

1215
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,940
You will have to pay Rs.5000.

1216
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,340
See, when I offered him he refused.

1217
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:59,860
Hey, shut up.

1218
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,700
There's a huge difference in..

1219
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:04,420
..pulling the chain and
stealing the tracks from the yard.

1220
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,780
Characterless.

1221
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:07,940
Sit there quietly. Look, actually..

1222
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:11,180
Release Pappu or else
I will shoot you right here.

1223
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:13,180
Billu. Billu. Are you here to free us?

1224
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,180
Shut up. Otherwise
we'll be in trouble.

1225
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:17,100
Look, you can't do this.

1226
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:20,660
How dare you arrest my friend?

1227
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,660
Hey. Shut up.

1228
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,020
Sit down.

1229
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:31,780
Release me.

1230
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:34,340
It's office time.

1231
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,580
Excuse me.

1232
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:43,420
Actually.. can we.. get a lift?

1233
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,180
Thank you, brother.

1234
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:58,940
Come on, let's go. Come on.

1235
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:03,580
No one in my family robbed
anything smaller than a goods train.

1236
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:07,100
And you got arrested
for stealing tracks.

1237
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,420
If you wanted to get arrested..

1238
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,180
..then you should have
atleast done something big.

1239
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:13,180
Pappu. Pappu.

1240
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,940
You are like the innocent girl..

1241
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,180
..that every man in the
village takes advantage of.

1242
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,580
Useless.

1243
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:21,340
It's not my fault, brother.

1244
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:24,180
It's that rascal
Shusheel Kumar's fault.

1245
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:27,020
His men must have
given my information.

1246
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:28,940
Who is Shusheel Kumar?

1247
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:32,780
That tailor's son.
- Yes.

1248
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,420
See that.

1249
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,780
That scoundrel, the son of a tailor.

1250
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,180
He has become so bold that
he is trying to challenge me.

1251
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:43,260
Brother, these days
he runs his own gang.

1252
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,580
Rascal.
- Listen to that.

1253
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:49,580
Just out of the womb,
and already making gangs.

1254
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,260
He will learn his lesson..

1255
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:55,020
..when I get my hands on
him and wring his neck.

1256
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,260
Sit in the car.

1257
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:59,340
Bhanwar Lal,
take the car to his village.

1258
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,660
Are you okay?

1259
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:12,660
Let's go there. We will
knock him there itself.

1260
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:16,420
Brother, Asangarh is on
the way to Delhi, isn't it?

1261
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,940
I will shoot that rascal first.

1262
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:21,500
Here, in his chest.

1263
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:24,700
He dared to lock horns with
Bhairon Singh Gujjar, that rascal.

1264
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:25,940
What?

1265
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:28,580
We will skin him alive.
- Two pieces.

1266
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:31,780
And that, too, diagonally.
- Great.

1267
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:35,260
Brother, where are
you going to drop us?

1268
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,500
Who is he?

1269
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:37,860
Brother, he is..

1270
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:39,260
Brother, look.

1271
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:41,180
Shusheel Kumar's uncle's car.

1272
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,580
Bhanwar Lal, follow him.

1273
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,940
Turn, turn, take a u-turn.

1274
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,580
Don't let him go.

1275
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,100
Drive faster.

1276
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:02,940
I was locked in jail because of him.

1277
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,260
Drive faster, Bhanwar Lal. Faster.

1278
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:17,260
Bhanwar Lal, drive carefully.

1279
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,180
Brother, is it
important to go to Asangarh?

1280
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,700
Stop the car.

1281
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,580
I was just saying it's very
important to go to Asangarh..

1282
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,100
..otherwise how will
Shusheel Kumar learn his lesson?

1283
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:39,860
Where did such a big car disappear?

1284
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:41,020
It was right here.

1285
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:42,700
Why don't you keep track?

1286
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,660
Brother, there it is.
There goes the car.

1287
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:49,020
Turn, turn, turn the car, reverse.

1288
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,420
Yes, there it is.

1289
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,660
Hey, it's torn.

1290
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,860
That's okay, it can
be stitched easily.

1291
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,860
First we will thrash the tailor.

1292
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:00,660
Then we will make him stitch it.

1293
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:06,260
Bhanwar Lal, tail him, tail him.
- Yes, bravo.

1294
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,260
Bhanwar Lal, don't let him go.

1295
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:14,420
Even if you have to fly this car.

1296
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:22,500
Oh, no.

1297
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:25,100
That isn't Shusheel
Kumar's uncle's car.

1298
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,580
That car belongs to
Lallan from Teragarh.

1299
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:30,420
Stop.

1300
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,940
Sometimes, the car disappears..

1301
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:36,100
..at other times, we
follow the wrong car.

1302
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,260
You wasted so much of my time.

1303
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:39,940
Take it in reverse.

1304
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:41,660
Take it straight to the local bar.

1305
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:45,180
Hey, tailor, I am going to..

1306
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:48,260
Ok, let's have one strong beer.

1307
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:55,340
Brother.

1308
01:14:55,860 --> 01:15:00,500
I was saying if you
could drop us here..

1309
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:04,180
And anyway, there isn't
much space in the jeep. - Yes.

1310
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:05,860
Please drop us here.

1311
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:07,180
Throw them out.

1312
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:08,340
Get out.

1313
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,420
Thank you, brother.

1314
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,180
Okay, it's alright. Mention not.

1315
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,580
Thank you.

1316
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:18,940
Come on.

1317
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,500
Here's your bag.

1318
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:22,420
Carefully, brother.

1319
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:26,940
Do teach a lesson to
that Shusheel Kumar.

1320
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:34,580
Come, let's go.

1321
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,500
You are just..

1322
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,180
You take a lift from
just about anyone.

1323
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,260
I wonder where they left us.

1324
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:42,100
Keep walking, keep walking.

1325
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,860
Faster. Faster. Don't look that way.

1326
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:50,660
"my heart beats like
the train's engine"

1327
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:54,940
Madam, stop, stop.

1328
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:00,580
You don't have to catch a flight.

1329
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,580
Relax.

1330
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,860
Look, brother, you..

1331
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:13,500
Are you madam?
- Look, this doesn't suit you.

1332
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:17,340
Foreign stuff is really great.

1333
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:19,940
Please.. don't trouble her.. Leave it.

1334
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:22,860
I have contacts in police station.
You don't get it?

1335
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,580
You lost your laptop as well.

1336
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:29,660
Thank God, they only took my laptop.

1337
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,340
Are you okay?

1338
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:38,020
What okay? My shoes are broken,
my clothes are torn.

1339
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,860
I am carrying an empty bag.

1340
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:42,020
And I haven't been to the
bathroom for the past two days.

1341
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,660
So.. what's the big deal

1342
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:51,700
This is a open jungle. You can..
- Really?

1343
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:59,420
We will find a small hotel there.

1344
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:08,180
I was thinking that.. what if they..

1345
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,260
..steal your bank's
information from your laptop?

1346
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,420
They cannot do anything.

1347
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,260
Laptop's specialty.

1348
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:19,780
Face recognition, password protection.

1349
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:22,020
That's good.

1350
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:25,940
Then they won't be
able to sell it either.

1351
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:31,660
You really think I care.

1352
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:34,180
Yes, let's go.

1353
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,180
Just a little further.

1354
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:55,260
Come on.

1355
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,700
We have arrived.

1356
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:12,940
It's a long story, Vikram.

1357
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:18,500
I will tell you when we meet.

1358
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:21,860
Just get me out of here.

1359
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:24,780
Vikram, don't shout..

1360
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:27,780
I am tired, I am fed up
and I just want to go home.

1361
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:34,420
It's some Red Tomato.. Palace.

1362
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:37,700
Jhunjhunu junction. Gol Chowk market.

1363
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,420
Okay.

1364
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:42,020
Just please come soon,
I can't take it anymore.

1365
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:43,580
Okay. Okay.

1366
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,780
Okay, love you. Bye.

1367
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,580
Here, yours is 301.

1368
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:53,340
I will go find out the menu.

1369
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:55,260
It's been so long
since I ate the 'Ghewar'.

1370
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:57,340
hungry? Eat this.

1371
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,500
Would you like anything?

1372
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:08,020
See, she's hungry.

1373
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,860
So tell me what
today's special menu is.

1374
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:14,340
Chilly fritters, onion fritters,
snacks, potato with ladyfinger.

1375
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:17,580
Barbecued chicken. And sweets.
Sweets with cream.

1376
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:20,180
And there is a special
arrangement in the basement.

1377
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:22,940
You mean there's a
buffet in the basement

1378
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,500
Sir..

1379
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,700
Today there is a special program..

1380
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:32,100
..in our honeymoon
hall in the basement.

1381
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,020
Only for gents.

1382
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:37,100
I see.

1383
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:40,180
Greetings, Sir!

1384
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:42,020
Hello.

1385
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,260
This looks like pure
'Pashmina' (Cashmere Wool).

1386
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,660
It must be expensive.

1387
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,780
Chew it.

1388
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:17,100
Chew it.

1389
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,020
It's brother's paan (betel leaf
with tobacco and betel nuts).

1390
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,940
Chew it.

1391
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:26,500
Great. The betel-leaf is really nice.

1392
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:56,260
Come, I will show you some real fun.

1393
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:59,260
Send the bags to the room.

1394
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:01,260
Let's go.
- Come, come, come.

1395
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:03,100
You are our guest.

1396
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:14,260
"Love is my spell."

1397
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:16,940
O enchantress!

1398
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:23,780
"Love is my spell."

1399
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:32,580
"It will knock you out."

1400
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:39,180
"No one can escape..

1401
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:48,940
..my charming eyes."

1402
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:53,980
"Laila, I am Laila."
- Brother, greetings.

1403
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:59,620
"I am such a seductress."

1404
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:12,380
"Everyone wishes to meet me alone."

1405
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:17,220
Wow!
- Great.

1406
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:33,300
"Take care, Laila is here to
knock you off your senses."

1407
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:36,820
"Just my glimpse can
give you sleepless nights."

1408
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:40,140
"My attitude is mesmerizing."

1409
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:43,300
"My name has created uproar around."

1410
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:46,900
"My gait is alluring,
everyone's crazy about it."

1411
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:51,140
"Only the Lord knows who
will dwell in my heart."

1412
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:54,740
"Laila, I am Laila."

1413
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:58,140
"I am such a seductress."

1414
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:04,820
"Everyone wishes to meet me alone."

1415
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:08,540
"Laila, I am Laila."

1416
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:12,140
"I am such a seductress."

1417
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:19,900
"Everyone wishes to meet me alone."

1418
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:39,060
"I am captivating.
Whoever gets a taste of me.."

1419
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:43,140
"..falls head over heels for me,
brings the world at my feet."

1420
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:46,460
"Whoever watches my enchantment,
says.."

1421
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:47,820
"You're charming, Laila."

1422
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:49,740
"You're charming, Laila."

1423
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:53,060
"I am captivating.
Whoever gets a taste of me.."

1424
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:57,060
"..falls head over heels for me,
brings the world at my feet."

1425
01:23:57,140 --> 01:24:00,380
"Whoever watches my enchantment,
says.."

1426
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:01,620
"You're charming, Laila."

1427
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,740
"You're charming, Laila."

1428
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:05,220
Laila!

1429
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:50,060
The programs in these small cities..

1430
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:51,620
..are so unique.

1431
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:55,220
Just play a Hindi
movie song, dance around.

1432
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,700
And it's a full house.

1433
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:00,980
It was fun.

1434
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:08,900
You freshen up. I will wait outside.

1435
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,380
I already freshened up.

1436
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:11,820
Please sit.

1437
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,740
Your husband was
supposed to be here, wasn't he?

1438
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:14,900
I will go take a look.

1439
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,980
Vikram will be
arriving two hours later.

1440
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:19,300
Then I will take a
look two hours later.

1441
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:22,700
Shall I order food?
- How much are you going to eat?

1442
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:25,300
I was talking about you.

1443
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,740
For me.

1444
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,380
No, thank you.

1445
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:39,980
Just imagine, if your wife..

1446
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:45,300
..finds you in a strange hotel,
in a strange place..

1447
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:50,380
..with an unknown girl,
what will she say?

1448
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:53,700
'She won't say anything.

1449
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:56,900
Really?

1450
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:00,540
Yes, my wife is beyond these problems.

1451
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:01,900
It doesn't make a difference to her.

1452
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:05,900
Okay.

1453
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:13,380
What is your residence number?
- 6283314.

1454
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,740
What.. what are you doing?

1455
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:17,980
Calling your home to
tell her you are fine.

1456
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:19,220
It's not a problem, right?

1457
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,540
No, no, there is no need for that.

1458
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:23,620
Yes. Hello, am I speaking with Mrs..

1459
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:26,380
Actually.. - I told you
there is no need for that.

1460
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:31,460
Actually we aren't talking
to each other these days.

1461
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:34,820
If I make the call it
would mean my defeat.

1462
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:37,980
She should apologize.

1463
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:42,740
Your phone

1464
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:52,980
Yes, Gopi.

1465
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:54,540
What?

1466
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:57,620
This matter will go on for long.

1467
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:02,300
Mr. Pandey and Mr. Bhaiyya
won't spare each other.

1468
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:04,140
But what happened here?

1469
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:05,820
And so suddenly?
- Yes.

1470
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:08,220
Madam, it's a long story.

1471
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,060
It's a political matter.

1472
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:14,140
Mr. Pandey's brother-in-law,
Mr. Bhaiyya.

1473
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:15,820
They both are from rival parties.

1474
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:19,300
They have been looking for
an opportunity for a clash.

1475
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:20,900
Today, they got the opportunity.

1476
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:23,700
That too, in my Red Tomato.

1477
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:26,220
Here, in this hotel.
What are you saying?

1478
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:29,980
In the honeymoon hall in the
basement, during the program.

1479
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,900
Someone spat betel-leaf
residue on Mr. Bhaiyya's kurta.

1480
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,740
Oh, no. Then?

1481
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:38,460
"My gait is alluring,
everyone's crazy about it."

1482
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:42,620
"Only the Lord knows who
will dwell in my heart."

1483
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:45,740
"Laila, I am Laila."

1484
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:48,220
Laila's darling.

1485
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:49,820
What's this! Spit.

1486
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,820
Hey, someone spat on you?

1487
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,060
Who could it be!

1488
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,700
There he is. Chewing like a cow.

1489
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:56,380
It must be him. Stop him.

1490
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,540
After that, Mr. Bhaiyya thought that..

1491
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:03,380
..Mr. Pandey's men must have done it.

1492
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:05,380
He slapped him hard.

1493
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:07,900
And after that,
it erupted into a quarrel..

1494
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:11,140
..and from here,
it reached all the way to Gol Chowk.

1495
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:12,820
There is complete chaos.

1496
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:16,300
What now?
- What can happen?

1497
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,820
It has engulfed the
whole of Jhunjhunu.

1498
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:20,700
Gangs are coming from outside.

1499
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,980
And there's a curfew
in the entire city.

1500
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:24,620
Curfew.

1501
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,820
How will Vikram come here now?

1502
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:28,380
That's great.

1503
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:30,380
When people don't know
how to eat betel-leaf..

1504
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:32,300
..why do they eat it? Isn't it?

1505
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:37,900
Sajjan Singh will come
there with the money.

1506
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,620
Keep it in the blue drawer
without letting mother see it.

1507
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,820
Don't start counting
it in front of everyone.

1508
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:45,220
Understood? I will talk to you later.

1509
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:47,220
Stop. Stop.

1510
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:49,300
Are you in a hurry?

1511
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,540
Take a u-turn, sir.

1512
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:55,980
It's closed ahead.

1513
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:57,540
There's a gang-war going
on between Pandey's gang..

1514
01:28:57,620 --> 01:28:59,820
..and Shrivastav's gang in Jhunjhunu.

1515
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:01,820
That's why. Understand?

1516
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,980
Now leave. You can't go
any further than this.

1517
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:05,380
Move.

1518
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:11,540
O God! Why did it all
have to happen today?

1519
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:14,980
I am sure you must have
spat that betel-leaf residue.

1520
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:18,900
Am I the only one who chews
betel-leaf in the whole of Jhunjhunu?

1521
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,820
Tomorrow, if the
government collapses..

1522
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:23,140
..she will blame me for that as well.

1523
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:25,620
Sit down, don't worry,

1524
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:27,620
Why shouldn't I be worried?
There's a riot outside.

1525
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:29,980
What's the big deal.

1526
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:32,700
What's the big deal.

1527
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:35,980
What's the big deal.

1528
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:39,540
You know, ever since I met you..

1529
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:43,140
..I am trying to figure out
what would be a big deal for you.

1530
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,140
When they come in and attack us..

1531
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:46,900
..will that be a big deal for you?

1532
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:54,300
Vikram.

1533
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:56,300
Thank God.

1534
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:58,620
Boyfriend.
- Husband.

1535
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:02,060
Are you okay?
- I am now.

1536
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:04,460
Let's go.
- Sir, there is a riot outside.

1537
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:05,540
How can you go?

1538
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:07,300
The riots have ended a long time ago.

1539
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:08,460
You civilians really are..

1540
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:10,060
We fight the enemies at the border..

1541
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:11,980
..and you fight amongst yourselves.

1542
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:13,380
You civilians should be ashamed.

1543
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:15,740
You don't have any sense. Let's go.

1544
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:17,380
This is my husband.

1545
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,300
Lt. Colonel Vikram Singh Rana.

1546
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,820
And he is the one who brought me here.

1547
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:25,540
Hello.
- Not him. Him.

1548
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:27,140
Hello.

1549
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:29,060
'Hail the youth, hail the farmers.'

1550
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:31,300
Don't fight amongst yourselves,
understand?

1551
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:32,900
Let's go, the riots are over. Come.

1552
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:34,620
Mr. Pandey, Mr. Bhaiyya.. it's okay.

1553
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:38,060
And you know, he fed the
TC Ghevar (a sweet snack).

1554
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:40,820
Hey, you don't know, he was
asking for Gulabjamun (a sweetmeat).

1555
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:49,380
You went through all that.

1556
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:52,060
Oh, God.
- That was great, nice meeting you.

1557
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:54,380
Thank you, nice meeting you too.
- Well done, well done.

1558
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:56,380
Let me tell you one thing.
I wonder what would have happened..

1559
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:57,700
..to my wife if it wasn't for you.

1560
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:58,700
What would have happened?

1561
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:00,900
I would have reached
Delhi on time yesterday.

1562
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:03,220
Isn't that right?
- You are just..

1563
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:05,540
Later.

1564
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:09,300
Well, at least call home now.

1565
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:10,980
They must be so worried.

1566
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:12,620
There is no need for that.

1567
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:14,140
We are almost home.

1568
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:15,620
What kind of a person are you?

1569
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:17,220
Such an ego. And that too, male ego.

1570
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:19,220
It's just not done.
- It's not like that..

1571
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:21,820
She is right. Why
don't you just call home.

1572
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:23,820
I insist. Give him the phone.

1573
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:29,620
What happened?
- My phone.

1574
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:31,380
I can't find my phone.

1575
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:34,300
Did you leave it back at the hotel?

1576
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:35,740
Yes, that's right.

1577
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:39,060
Should I take a u-turn?
- No big deal.

1578
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:41,900
That's a nice attitude.

1579
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:44,700
You have developed a great attitude.

1580
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:48,620
Here.
- No, no, really..

1581
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:49,820
Call her, that's okay.

1582
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:53,060
I insist, call her.
- Okay, if you insist.

1583
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:58,540
Hello.

1584
01:31:58,700 --> 01:31:59,900
Yes, it's me.

1585
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:03,980
The flight was diverted
from Delhi to Jaipur..

1586
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,620
You won't understand.

1587
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:07,300
I am coming.

1588
01:32:07,740 --> 01:32:09,820
I am not making any excuses.

1589
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,380
You are just.. Listen.

1590
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:12,620
This is not my phone.

1591
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:13,820
I can't talk to you for too long.

1592
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:15,460
That's okay, you can talk to her.
- That's okay. - Yes.

1593
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,540
No, no, I am almost there.
I will come see you.

1594
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:20,820
You don't know, once Vibha starts,
she doesn't stop.

1595
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:22,620
Thank you.

1596
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,620
Stop on the left.

1597
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:30,820
Your home is here.
- No, it's in the alley inside.

1598
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,540
Then I will take it inside.
- No, no..

1599
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:34,820
The car won't go inside.
I will walk on foot.

1600
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:36,700
By God, let it be. I mean it.

1601
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:38,820
It's very far inside.

1602
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:40,980
Very far for you, but near for me.

1603
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:43,380
Sure?
- Yes. 100 percent.

1604
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:45,540
Shall I stop here?
- Yes.

1605
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:50,380
Go ahead and take right. That's it.

1606
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:52,700
Stop here, here.

1607
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:55,060
Okay.
- We've reached Delhi, thank you.

1608
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:57,900
Nice meeting you.
- Thanks, sir. Salutations, sir.

1609
01:32:58,380 --> 01:32:59,460
Okay.

1610
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:03,700
I..

1611
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:09,060
Okay, colonel. See you.
- Look after yourself.

1612
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:10,540
Thanks for the lift.

1613
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:17,460
Why is she getting down?
What happened?

1614
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:21,620
So I guess this is it.

1615
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:24,300
Yes, this is my Chandni Chowk.

1616
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:30,380
No, I mean.. the end of our journey.

1617
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:32,980
Yes, the journey has ended.

1618
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:35,460
We have reached Delhi. Who knew..
- Yes.

1619
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:38,820
I was saying..

1620
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:43,740
..I apologize for any..

1621
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:45,380
No, please.

1622
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:50,540
Whatever it was I have to say..
it was very interesting.

1623
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:52,140
Mr..

1624
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:56,140
Brother.

1625
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:59,140
I think you didn't
read my name on the card.

1626
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:02,620
It's okay. My name is Manu Gupta.

1627
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:06,820
Mihika Banerjee.

1628
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:10,140
Nice to meet you.

1629
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:12,300
Very nice to meet you.

1630
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:13,820
Goodbye.

1631
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:40,220
Oh! I am so tired.

1632
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:46,620
What is that?

1633
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:51,700
Flowers of henna are soaked in vinegar

1634
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:54,380
and then mixed with elephants poop..

1635
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:57,140
Headache formula.
- Are you serious?

1636
01:34:57,220 --> 01:35:01,620
Yes, A-one formula for
Head aches and body aches.

1637
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:03,060
It belongs to him.

1638
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,820
And I am going to use it.
- Please use it.

1639
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,380
Oh, no.

1640
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:11,380
Listen, your ad office had called.

1641
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:14,740
Oh, no, I forgot to call them.

1642
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:16,300
Vikram, where is your phone?

1643
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:18,220
There it is.
- That's it.

1644
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:25,460
Hi, Vineet.

1645
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:27,740
Sorry, I couldn't call you back.

1646
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,980
No, I was tied up in something.

1647
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:33,540
Listen, I have figured out
what is missing in that ad.

1648
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:37,060
Whether it's Mr. Sharma or Mr. Verma,
it doesn't make a difference.

1649
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:38,820
I think that should be the end.

1650
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:41,460
Yes, okay.

1651
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:42,980
And listen.

1652
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:44,220
I am in Delhi on Monday..

1653
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:46,620
..so if you want to drop by,
you can come at anytime, okay?

1654
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:49,140
Okay. Bye.

1655
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:54,380
You were supposed to
go to the US on Monday.

1656
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:56,540
What happened?
- I am not going.

1657
01:35:56,740 --> 01:35:58,380
Are you sure?
- Yes.

1658
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:01,300
Why?
- Because you are going to..

1659
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:04,140
..throw my birthday party on Sunday.

1660
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:06,220
And the next day, I will be hung over.

1661
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:08,140
So I will go after that.

1662
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:10,380
You have changed.

1663
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:15,380
Listen..

1664
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:19,300
Look there in the pocket.

1665
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:20,980
I brought something for you.

1666
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:23,820
Take a look, it's in my jacket.
- Really? - Your birthday gift.

1667
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:25,980
Yes. Found it.

1668
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:31,220
Oh, my, God. Vikram, it's beautiful,

1669
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,900
You like it?

1670
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:42,380
I am so lucky.

1671
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:45,300
I have the most
wonderful husband in the world.

1672
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:48,540
And I want to celebrate my birthday..

1673
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:51,700
..with my friends
and family at my home.

1674
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:55,220
There's still time
before we reach home. - Yes.

1675
01:36:55,300 --> 01:36:57,220
Let's make a list.
- Yes. Great.

1676
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,140
Tell me, who do you want to invite?

1677
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:00,740
The usual suspects.
- Okay.

1678
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:02,140
Sangeeta.
- Sangeeta.

1679
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:04,140
Kunal.
- Kunal. - Jeet. - Jeet.

1680
01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:07,540
Why don't we call him..
Your friend from this journey?

1681
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:09,140
Why not invite him?

1682
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:10,900
You have the best ideas.

1683
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:15,900
Where is my phone?
- Yes.

1684
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:17,820
It must be the last dialed number..

1685
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:19,380
Call him back.
- Of course.

1686
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:27,060
The number you have dialed is invalid.

1687
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:29,140
What happened?

1688
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:31,300
They are saying it's
an invalid number.

1689
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:32,540
Show me.

1690
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:37,220
You seem to have
dialed a wrong number.

1691
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:40,060
Please check the number.. - Yes,
its an invalid number you have dialed.

1692
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:41,900
Why would he do that?

1693
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,140
Why would he?

1694
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:50,060
Vikram, turn the car around please.

1695
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:53,060
Are you sure? - Please. - Yes, just..
just turn the car around.

1696
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:06,900
Where are you going?
- I want to find out something.

1697
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:08,380
Should I come along?
- No. I am fine.

1698
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:11,140
Are you sure?
- Yes. - Just two minutes.

1699
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:28,060
Excuse me, do you know
where Manu Gupta lives?

1700
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:29,220
I don't know that.

1701
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:30,700
But please taste these kebabs.

1702
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:32,380
No, thank you.

1703
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:46,620
Excuse me, do you
know where Manu Gupta..

1704
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:49,820
..who has a shop in Karol Baug, lives?

1705
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,460
Mr. Gupta.
- Yes.

1706
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:53,540
Go into the alley right in front.
- Yes.

1707
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:56,460
It's the first house on the left.
- Okay.

1708
01:38:56,540 --> 01:38:58,060
Thank you.
- Okay.

1709
01:39:57,820 --> 01:40:00,820
Manu uncle's home.
- Yes.

1710
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:03,460
It's the last house.
- Okay, thank you.

1711
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:21,460
Hello, does Manu Gupta stay here?

1712
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:23,620
Someone's at the door for you.

1713
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:27,380
Just coming

1714
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:31,900
Its you!

1715
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:36,460
Your wife.

1716
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:40,460
She's still angry?

1717
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:42,460
No, she wasn't my wife.

1718
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:44,300
She is the nurse.

1719
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:46,900
My wife..

1720
01:40:48,980 --> 01:40:51,220
Come in. Come on.

1721
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,220
Come in.

1722
01:40:57,460 --> 01:41:00,820
She is my wife, Vibha.

1723
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:13,300
Vibha, look who is here.

1724
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:14,900
Mihika.

1725
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:17,980
The one I was telling you about.

1726
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:23,220
Two years ago,
she got high fever and..

1727
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,620
..it went up here.

1728
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:31,300
To her brain.

1729
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:34,980
And since then, she is in coma.

1730
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:37,820
Why..

1731
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:42,060
Why didn't you tell me?

1732
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:45,900
I never told anyone anything.

1733
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:49,540
Why are you standing? Sit down.

1734
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:56,220
What's the point in telling anyone?

1735
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:59,460
The more I tell people,
the more they'll sympathize.

1736
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:02,980
And the more they sympathize,
The more it'll hurt me.

1737
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:06,460
And I don't want to live like that.

1738
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:11,540
The truth is that when
something is not in our control..

1739
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:13,980
..its foolish to let it affect you.

1740
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:19,980
I believe.. change what you
can and accept what you cant.

1741
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:23,140
What? I said, accept it.

1742
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:26,980
But your children.

1743
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:28,540
I have two daughters.

1744
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:29,820
Shraddha and Archana.

1745
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:32,220
They live in Meerut
with my elder sister.

1746
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:36,820
I stay out of the house
half the time for work.

1747
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:38,700
So they are better off with her.

1748
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:40,300
They do come here
sometimes on Sundays.

1749
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:43,540
This is my family.

1750
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:46,980
Wife's here, children are there.

1751
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:50,060
And I, from here to there.

1752
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:52,140
A wandering traveler,

1753
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:55,140
And what do the doctors say?

1754
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:56,820
What would the doctors say?

1755
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:01,460
The doctors have..

1756
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:05,820
.. stopped saying anything,
just like her.

1757
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:07,300
All of them are quiet.

1758
01:43:10,820 --> 01:43:17,220
But I am sure that one day my
Vibha will be cured 100 percent?

1759
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:20,540
How sure?

1760
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:23,900
100 percent.

1761
01:43:25,820 --> 01:43:28,140
You are a shameless woman.

1762
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:29,700
There's a guest at Home who
has come for the first time..

1763
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:31,300
..and you didn't
even ask her for water.

1764
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:33,300
She has grown lazy.

1765
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:35,900
I will get water for you.

1766
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:42,300
Now I understand..

1767
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:46,540
What the big deal was.

1768
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:50,620
What did you say?

1769
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:53,700
Just that..

1770
01:43:54,540 --> 01:43:58,820
..when something so devastating
has happened in someone's life..

1771
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:02,980
..then nothing else
seems like a big deal..

1772
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:04,980
It's just a point of view.

1773
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:06,540
See..

1774
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:09,900
No matter in what
condition my wife is in..

1775
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:12,540
..at least she is with me.

1776
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:15,060
And you know.

1777
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:17,820
Vibha isn't an ordinary wife.

1778
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:20,540
She's the only wife in the world..

1779
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:22,820
..who doesn't argue with her husband.

1780
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:27,900
So you too learnt to
laugh at your sorrows.

1781
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,300
Here.
- Thank you.

1782
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:37,140
But there is one thing
I still didn't quite get..

1783
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:41,060
Why did you suddenly.. return

1784
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:45,380
Actually tomorrow, which is a Sunday

1785
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:47,300
There is a party at my home.

1786
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:51,620
And Vikram and
I wanted to invite you for it.

1787
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:57,540
Me? - Look, you tried to
avoid us even earlier.

1788
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:02,380
But I found your home.
- No, I..

1789
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:04,460
No excuses this time.

1790
01:45:04,700 --> 01:45:06,220
Do come.

1791
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:08,300
You do remember the address,
don't you?

1792
01:45:08,380 --> 01:45:11,700
Chanakyapuri, Ninth main,
bungalow no. 44.

1793
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:13,220
Yes, I do.
- Exactly.

1794
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:17,060
No, actually you..
It's such a big party.

1795
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:21,460
And I will look out of
place amongst your friends.

1796
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:24,820
There are very few places..

1797
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:27,220
..where you will be out of place.

1798
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:31,980
And many places where
I will be out of place.

1799
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:34,380
So, do come.

1800
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:38,140
Actually, it's my birthday.

1801
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:42,900
Happy birthday to you. In advance.
- No.

1802
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:44,900
I will shake hands with you tomorrow..

1803
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:47,380
..when you come home and wish me.

1804
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:51,220
And.. you've already
given me my birthday gift.

1805
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:52,700
Birthday gift.

1806
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:54,380
Your favorite ointment,

1807
01:45:54,460 --> 01:45:57,900
I see. Yes, you can keep that.
For your migraine.

1808
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:00,700
So.. I will see you tomorrow.

1809
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:02,900
Please, do come.

1810
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:04,900
Okay, I will take your leave.

1811
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:07,900
But how did you come here?
- Oh, I walked.

1812
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:09,460
But the car is on the road.

1813
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:12,380
They won't let
Vikram park on the road.

1814
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:14,620
He will have to go ahead and park.

1815
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:17,540
Let me drop you.
- No, no. No problem.

1816
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:19,740
I'll go on my own.
- No big deal.

1817
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:22,300
I'll drop you on my scooter

1818
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:26,380
Okay. - And it will be
faster for you as well. - Yes.

1819
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:32,620
Vibha, I will be right
back after I drop her.

1820
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:34,060
Don't get up.

1821
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:35,980
Can she hear us?

1822
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,740
No, she can't.. hear.

1823
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:43,300
But I can talk.

1824
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:46,380
Right?
- Yes. - Come on.

1825
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:55,060
Let's go.

1826
01:46:56,380 --> 01:46:57,900
I hope you can get on it.

1827
01:46:58,220 --> 01:46:59,900
By the way, Happy
Diwali (festival of lights).

1828
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:02,380
Sit tight.
- Yes.

1829
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:06,140
You must not have sat on a
scooter before, have you? - No.

1830
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:11,220
What happened?
- Nothing, it just stopped.

1831
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,060
It will just start.

1832
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:16,820
Are you serious?
- Yes, it's just..

1833
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:18,220
It happens sometimes during winters.

1834
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:23,900
Its okay, what's the big deal!

1835
01:47:25,540 --> 01:47:27,140
Well said.

1836
01:47:27,460 --> 01:47:31,380
It started.
- Look, its started. I told you.

1837
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:34,060
Now let's go to New Delhi.

1838
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:36,620
But seriously, I must admit, guys.

1839
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:38,220
My meeting with Manu Gupta..

1840
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:40,820
..was nothing short
of a big deal for me.

1841
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:44,700
Meanwhile, a small thing
happened at our Dharampal's house.

1842
01:47:44,740 --> 01:47:45,980
A sweet daughter.

1843
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:48,060
Meaning, a daughter stays a daughter,
till the end of life.

1844
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:51,380
Maybe Pappu and gang are
searching for Shusheel Kumar..

1845
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:53,300
..on Google search now.

1846
01:47:53,380 --> 01:47:56,900
Provided, they can
crack my laptop's password.

1847
01:47:56,980 --> 01:47:58,980
Shivratan, who couldn't
blame the rich enough..

1848
01:47:59,060 --> 01:48:03,980
..finally found a shoulder to rest on.

1849
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:09,700
And back at the inn, Jhujhar
Singh began Sunny's lessons.

1850
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:11,300
What did he start?

1851
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:13,540
Lessons.

1852
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:15,220
Speaking about lessons..

1853
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:18,980
If you are traveling by train
without a ticket due to any reason..

1854
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:20,380
..then don't panic.

1855
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:22,380
Talk to the TC traveling on the train.

1856
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:25,700
He has the right to
issue a fresh ticket to you.

1857
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:28,540
Spitting around is a bad habit.

1858
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:32,380
Meanwhile, Gujjar was
fed up of running around..

1859
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:36,700
..and now he is thinking of
finding a nice girl and settling down.

1860
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:42,540
Uncle.. Mishra is still quite
tied up in managing the station.

1861
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:44,540
Mr. Bhaiyya, Laila and Mr. Pandey..

1862
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:46,620
..have literally spit out their enmity

1863
01:48:46,700 --> 01:48:49,220
..become friends and
have come to Mumbai.

1864
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:51,820
To take part in a reality dance show.

1865
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:56,140
Goldie is still happily..
blaming the system.

1866
01:48:56,740 --> 01:49:01,220
And Manu.. is still
laughing at his sorrows..

1867
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:03,220
..and celebrating happiness.

1868
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:08,460
And me.. Well, Vikram and
I have decided to start a family.

1869
01:49:08,540 --> 01:49:11,740
And the best thing is that
Vikram has been transferred to Mumbai.

1870
01:49:11,820 --> 01:49:15,140
So I guess now it's 'Chalo
Mumbai' (Let's go to Mumbai).

1871
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:19,820
"Let's go Delhi."

1872
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:25,060
"Let's go Delhi."

1873
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:27,980
"Let's go Delhi."

1874
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:31,060
"Let's go Delhi."

1875
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:45,980
"Life is short, why criticize?"

1876
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:48,980
"Have fun if you are right."

1877
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:51,740
"Stop thinking so much."

1878
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:54,620
"Loosen up a bit."

1879
01:49:54,980 --> 01:49:57,900
"Life is short."

1880
01:49:57,980 --> 01:50:00,820
"Don't waste it
worrying about problems."

1881
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:03,740
"Stop thinking so much."

1882
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:06,300
"Loosen up a bit."

1883
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:09,460
"Give me a high-five
if you want to rise."

1884
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:12,380
"Because life short."

1885
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:15,460
"Give me a high-five
if you want to rise."

1886
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:18,540
"Because life short."

1887
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:21,460
"Stop worrying too much."

1888
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:23,980
"Stop worrying too much."

1889
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:27,460
"Stop worrying too much."

1890
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:30,740
"Stop worrying too much."

1891
01:50:30,820 --> 01:50:33,980
"Let's go Delhi."

1892
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:36,900
"Let's go Delhi."

1893
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:42,220
"Let's go Delhi."

1894
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:43,980
"Let's go Delhi."

1895
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:45,380
"Let's go Delhi."

1896
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:48,460
"Let's go Delhi."

1897
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:49,900
"Let's go Delhi."

1898
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:51,460
"Let's go Delhi."

1899
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:54,620
"Let's go Delhi."

1900
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:57,460
"Live life to the fullest."

1901
01:50:57,620 --> 01:51:00,820
"Today will be gone forever."

1902
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:03,380
"Why do you worry so much.."

1903
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:06,700
"..when all of us
have to leave one day?"

1904
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:15,300
"Live life to the fullest."

1905
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:18,820
"Today will be gone forever."

1906
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:21,380
"Why do you worry so much.."

1907
01:51:21,380 --> 01:51:24,540
"..when all of us
have to leave one day?"

1908
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:27,700
"Stop crying and be cool."

1909
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:30,540
"Handle yourself or
you may make a mistake."

1910
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:33,700
"Stop crying and be cool."

1911
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:36,140
"Handle yourself or
you may make a mistake."

1912
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:38,140
"Stop worrying too much."
