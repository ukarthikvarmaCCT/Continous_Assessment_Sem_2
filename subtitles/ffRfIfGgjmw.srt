1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,092
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,092 --> 00:00:04,782
Another conflict has broken out 
between Israel and Palestine.

3
00:00:04,782 --> 00:00:07,748
At 6.30 AM on the morning of 7th October,

4
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:10,941
While most of the Israelis were 
sleeping soundly in their homes,

5
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:14,138
suddenly, the air raid sirens began blaring.

6
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:20,321
In a short while, thousands of 
rockets were fired at Israeli cities.

7
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,520
Israeli Defence Forces estimate that

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,418
2,200 rockets were fired.

9
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:26,214
However, the group Ham_s claims that

10
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:28,001
5,000 rockets were fired.

11
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:31,653
Israel has an Iron Dome system.

12
00:00:31,653 --> 00:00:34,144
It is one of the best air defence systems in the world.

13
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:36,496
Whenever rockets are fired on Israel,

14
00:00:36,496 --> 00:00:39,375
it uses the latest military technology

15
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,967
to intercept the rockets 
and destroy them midflight

16
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:45,582
to keep the country protected.

17
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:49,779
But here, 5,000 rockets were fired within 20 minutes.

18
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:51,744
This Iron Dome system failed.

19
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:57,067
Thousands of people were k_lled and injured 
in Israel because of these attacks.

20
00:00:57,067 --> 00:01:00,077
This surprise attack is the biggest 
in the last few decades

21
00:01:00,077 --> 00:01:02,349
that has been seen in 
the Israel-Palestine conflict.

22
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:05,187
And it reminds us of the Yom Kippur War.

23
00:01:05,187 --> 00:01:07,093
Exactly 50 years ago,

24
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:08,826
in October 1973,

25
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:13,800
Egypt and Syria had launched 
a similar surprise attack on Israel.

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,634
After that, a war broke out

27
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:17,817
Known as the Yom Kippur War.

28
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:21,093
And this attack is no less 
than a full-scale war.

29
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:23,010
In addition to the rocket strikes,

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,817
Ham_s launched a multi-pronged attack

31
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:27,217
from the ground, sea, and air.

32
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:30,348
The boundary wall on the Israel-Gaza border

33
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:33,085
was broken down by a bulldozer.

34
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:37,188
Many Palestinians were seen 
entering Israeli territory.

35
00:01:37,188 --> 00:01:38,764
Some on motorcycles,

36
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:41,439
some using motor-powered hang-gliders

37
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,523
to enter Israel through the air.

38
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:48,266
Apart from this, Ham_s also attacked Israel 
from the sea using speedboats.

39
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:50,930
Many events took place within a day.

40
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,995
A military base on the Israel-Gaza border 
was also attacked.

41
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:56,444
An Israeli tank was captured.

42
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:58,831
Many Israeli soldiers were captured

43
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:01,538
and held hostages by the Ham_s group.

44
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,521
And the Israeli villages and cities on the border

45
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:08,834
were infiltrated by arm_d t_rr_rists of Ham_s.

46
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,198
Many innocent civilians have been k_ll_d here, 

47
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,184
many are being held as hostages

48
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:17,307
and Israel has declared a state of war in response.

49
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:20,269
The Israeli military carried out airstrikes in Gaza,

50
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:24,687
In which thousands of Palestinians
were k_lled or injured.

51
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:28,671
Let's take a look at the map 
to understand the context of this situation.

52
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:31,231
Israel and Palestine are located in the Middle East.

53
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,834
In the North is the country of Lebanon.

54
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:34,522
In the Northeast, there is Syria.

55
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:35,827
In the East, there is Jordan.

56
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:36,905
In the South West, there is Egypt.

57
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:38,847
And in the West, is the Mediterranean Sea.

58
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:40,431
If you zoom in on both countries,

59
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:42,596
the area in the middle is the country of Israel.

60
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,989
And the territories of Palestine

61
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:46,710
are divided into two parts.

62
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,900
One is the region of the West Bank,

63
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,574
which is in the west of Jordan

64
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:51,096
and the other is the Gaza Strip

65
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:52,999
which is in the south-west of Israel

66
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:54,394
and borders Egypt.

67
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:58,469
There are many Israeli settlements 
in the Palestinian territory of the West Bank.

68
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,408
They are under Israel’s control.

69
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:02,425
And are considered illegal

70
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:04,492
by the United Nations
and many other countries.

71
00:03:04,492 --> 00:03:06,944
The Palestinian territories in the West Bank

72
00:03:06,944 --> 00:03:09,821
are administered by Palestinian Authorities

73
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,389
under the control of Fatah.

74
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:12,918
A political party.

75
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:14,778
On the other hand, the Gaza Strip

76
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,115
is controlled independently by Ham_s.

77
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:20,835
There has been a separate conflict 
between Fatah and Ham_s historically.

78
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:25,140
Ham_s is an extremist Palestinian organisation

79
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,319
which is considered a t_rr_rist organisation 
by most countries.

80
00:03:29,707 --> 00:03:31,640
Canada, the European Union, Israel,

81
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,908
Japan, Australia, the USA, and the UK

82
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:37,734
designate Ham_s as a t_rr_rist organisation.

83
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:41,012
On the other hand, it is not considered
a t_rr_rist organisation by

84
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,587
Brazil, China, Egypt,

85
00:03:42,587 --> 00:03:43,756
Iran, Norway, Qatar,

86
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,619
Russia, Syria, and Turkey.

87
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:49,707
There are also some countries 
that consider only Ham_s' military wing

88
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,307
as a t_rr_rist organisation.

89
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:53,023
Like New Zealand and Paraguay.

90
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:55,340
This is geopolitically relevant because

91
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,157
you will see how differently these countries 
are reacting to the current situation.

92
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,622
If we look at the map of the current conflict,

93
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:04,193
we can see that

94
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:06,260
the Gaza Strip is shown in red colour.

95
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,126
And the extent to which Israeli territory has 
been infiltrated by the Palestinian milit_nts

96
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:12,060
is shown in blue colour.

97
00:04:14,594 --> 00:04:16,660
Ham_s' military commander Mohammad Al-Deif

98
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,241
has named this attack 
Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.

99
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:22,595
And said that Ham_s is doing this because

100
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,067
Israel has committed atrocities on the Palestinians.

101
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,738
And that this is specifically a response

102
00:04:27,738 --> 00:04:30,080
of what happened in Al Aqsa mosque.

103
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,764
If you want to know about the issue
regarding Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem,

104
00:04:34,764 --> 00:04:37,844
I talked about it in this video 2 years ago.

105
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,008
I will put the link in the description below,

106
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:41,152
you can go and watch it.

107
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:43,829
For the Indian nationals present in Israel

108
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:48,956
the Indian embassy in Israel has issued an advisory

109
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,632
that you can see on the screen.

110
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:52,570
In case of an emergency,

111
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,642
they can call this number

112
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:57,921
or can send an email to this id.

113
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:59,962
Israel launched its own attack in response,

114
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:02,235
which was named Operation Iron Swords.

115
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:06,178
Israeli Defense Forces, 
also known as IDF in short,

116
00:05:06,178 --> 00:05:10,291
have deployed their Navy, Air Force, and Ground Forces.

117
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,337
Along with that, they launched drone strikes in Gaza.

118
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:15,904
Israel's Energy Minister signed an order

119
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:18,917
to cut the electricity supply in Gaza.

120
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:22,985
To a large extent, electricity was
 supplied through Israel to Gaza.

121
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:25,883
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

122
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:28,436
said at a television address,

123
00:05:28,436 --> 00:05:31,274
"Citizens of Israel, we are at war."

124
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:40,320
He said that the en_my will have to 
pay an unprecedented price.

125
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,387
The defence minister stated that

126
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:44,376
Ham_s has made a huge mistake

127
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,841
and Israel will win this war.

128
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:49,773
A big talking point in this conflict is how

129
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:54,335
Mossad, the world-famous Israeli intelligence agency,

130
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:57,278
failed to intercept this attack.

131
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:58,895
It is said that Mossad

132
00:05:58,895 --> 00:06:01,778
is one of the most powerful intelligence agencies.

133
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,314
They have informants even in 
the Palestinian military groups.

134
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:07,206
They are in Lebanon, Syria,

135
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:08,838
and in different parts of the world.

136
00:06:08,838 --> 00:06:11,858
In the past, it has been seen that Mossad agents

137
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:14,901
have carried out precise timed as_as_inations

138
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:16,480
of major military leaders.

139
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,138
Sometimes by placing GPS trackers on vehicles,

140
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:21,136
sometimes by using drone strikes,

141
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:23,100
or sometimes by using mobile phones.

142
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,076
If you want to know more about Mossad,

143
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:27,805
I would suggest this audiobook on Kuku FM.

144
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:30,679
It has been explained in great detail.

145
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,977
If you don't know Kuku FM,

146
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:34,384

156
00:06:56,997 --> 00:07:00,260
You can check out the link in the description.

157
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,911
And now, coming back to Mossad,

158
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:02,993
the question is,

159
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:05,709
despite being such a powerful agency,

160
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,936
how did they not know that

161
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:11,855
thousands of rockets were being stockpiled in Gaza?

162
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:15,369
The fencing on the Gaza-Israel border

163
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,396
has cameras, ground motion sensors,

164
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,273
and regular army patrols are carried out there.

165
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:22,381
Why did these smart barriers fail?

166
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:26,460
Domestically, the Israeli government 
is facing a lot of criticism.

167
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,344
The former head of the Israeli Navy

168
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:32,077
told the Israeli TV channel, Channel 12 that

169
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,984
this is a huge failure on the part of the government.

170
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:35,736
The entire country is asking

171
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:39,166
about the whereabouts of IDF, police, and security.

172
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:43,054
He told the BBC that a major 
investigation has already begun

173
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:45,266
regarding this intelligence failure.

174
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:47,848
Look at this article from The Times of Israel,

175
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:50,750
According to it, Egypt's intelligence officials

176
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,511
had warned Israel repeatedly that

177
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:54,576
something major was about to happen.

178
00:07:54,576 --> 00:07:57,740
And allegedly, those warnings were ignored.

179
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,746
On the other hand, talking about international reactions,

180
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,674
American President Joe Biden

181
00:08:01,674 --> 00:08:03,265
condemned this attack and

182
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:07,500
said that he shows 'rock-solid and unwavering support'

183
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,183
in favour of Israel.

184
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:11,277
The foreign policy chief of the European Union

185
00:08:11,277 --> 00:08:14,990
also said that he strongly condemns this attack

186
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,088
and says that according to international law,

187
00:08:17,088 --> 00:08:19,794
Israel has the right to defend itself.

188
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:24,261
They said that Israeli hostages 
should be released immediately.

189
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:27,751
Iran, which has been one 
of the main supporters of Ham_s,

190
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:29,552
their foreign ministry said that

191
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:34,613
the attack by Ham_s was an act of 
self-defence by the Palestinians.

192
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:37,174
The foreign ministry of the neighbouring
country Egypt said that

193
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:39,734
it is talking to Saudi Arabia and Jordan

194
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:44,096
in an attempt to diffuse the Israeli-Palestinian tensions.

195
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:46,357
The Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas,

196
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:49,592
told to the official news agency WAFA that

197
00:08:49,592 --> 00:08:54,905
the Palestinians have the right to protect themselves 
against the t_rr_r of the settlers and foreign troops.

198
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:56,490
As I said,

199
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,699
he is from the Fatah party

200
00:08:57,699 --> 00:08:59,523
which governs the West Bank.

201
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:03,713
And historically, there have been 
conflicts between Fatah and Ham_s.

202
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:07,804
2 years ago I made a detailed 
video on the Israel-Palestine conflict

203
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:10,743
in which I explained their long history.

204
00:09:10,743 --> 00:09:11,930
In it, I talked about how

205
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,479
Jews were persecuted in Europe for centuries

206
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:17,636
and to save their lives they migrated to Palestine

207
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:21,384
and now Palestinians have been reduced 
to refugees in their own country.

208
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:25,630
So Palestine's cause obviously deserves support

209
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,847
but not by supporting t_rr_rists.

210
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:31,505
This has been the stance of
 our Indian government, historically.

211
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:35,954
India has always supported the
 Palestinian cause of self-determination

212
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:37,621
under various Prime Ministers,

213
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:39,434
be it Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,

214
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:41,461
Rajiv Gandhi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee,

215
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:44,656
Manmohan Singh or Prime Minister Modi.

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,465
"But the situation in the Middle-East is clear,

217
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:50,631
the land which is occupied by Israel

218
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,095
has to be vacated."

219
00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:55,861
Prime Minister Modi has actually 
been the first Indian Prime Minister

220
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,793
to visit Palestine.

221
00:09:57,793 --> 00:10:00,389
Now the statement from PM Modi

222
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:02,488
has expressed shock

223
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:04,218
at the t_rr_rist attacks

224
00:10:04,218 --> 00:10:07,161
and he expressed solidarity with Israel

225
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:10,295
and Israel's innocent victims and their families.

226
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:12,109
And this is not surprising because

227
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:13,985
Ham_s' actions here

228
00:10:13,985 --> 00:10:15,815
is nothing but t_rr_rism.

229
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,329
Many disturbing videos have come up

230
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:23,229
where Ham_s t_rr_rists have treated 
women and civilians in a way that

231
00:10:23,229 --> 00:10:25,552
cannot even be described in this video.

232
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:27,377
It is a very shameful that

233
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,689
some people see them as freedom fighters.

234
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:33,884
It is true that there has been injustice 
against the common people in Palestine,

235
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,916
but k_lling the common people in Israel,

236
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,904
such t_rr_rism can never be justified.

237
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:42,255
I'd like to repeat what I said in the previous video.

238
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:45,622
Ham_s is a designated t_rr_rist organisation.

239
00:10:46,284 --> 00:10:48,587
And Israel is a powerful country

240
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:50,618
with a proper democratic government.

241
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:54,624
This is why Israel should use its powers responsibly.

242
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:57,765
Some comm_nal big_ts are very
offended by such statements.

243
00:10:57,765 --> 00:11:02,054
On one hand there are people who want 
complete erad_cation of Palestine.

244
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:04,880
They celebrate the attacks on Palestine.

245
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,868
Saying that none of them should surv_ve.

246
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:10,463
Without thinking about the common Palestinians

247
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,697
and what they go through.

248
00:11:11,697 --> 00:11:15,992
On the other hand, there are comm_nal 
people celebrating Ham_s t_rr_rists.

249
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:18,158
They are happy to see Israel being attacked.

250
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:21,121
They want Israel to be destr_yed.

251
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:23,187
And that Israel should not exi_t as a country.

252
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:25,307
When you come across such 
comments on social media,

253
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:28,148
remember that you are a human being,

254
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:29,828
not a vampire thirsty for blood.

255
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:32,288
War-mongering is very easy
 when you are sitting far away.

256
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:33,889
But think about it,

257
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:36,229
if you were in the midst of this war,

258
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:40,574
think about what the ordinary Israeli and 
Palestinian families are going through.

259
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:43,487
For life to come to a halt.

260
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,942
And to live in fear

261
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:48,146
that a rocket might hit your building at any moment.

262
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:51,042
Israel is also trying to show that

263
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:54,648
they are carrying out their counter-offensive responsibly.

264
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:58,090
Recently, there was an airstrike on
 a 14-storey building in Palestine.

265
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,953
But before the airstrike, Israel
 had issued a 10-minute warning

266
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:05,617
so that the people living in 
the building should evacuate it

267
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:07,001
before the b_mb could hit it.

268
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:08,952
Such warnings have been given before,

269
00:12:08,952 --> 00:12:12,065
like the warning given to Fatima Bashir's family

270
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,454
before the Israeli airstrike in May this year.

271
00:12:14,454 --> 00:12:18,115
Or in August 2022, a 15-minute 
warning was given to Gazans

272
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:19,788
before an Israeli airstrike.

273
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:21,869
Although Israel claims this

274
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:24,996
but the truth is that in Israeli airstrikes,

275
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:27,085
many Palestinian civilians have been k_lled.

276
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:28,689
We hope that

277
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:31,985
there can be long-lasting peace 
between these two countries.

278
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,657
But looking at the current situation, it seems that

279
00:12:34,657 --> 00:12:36,983
this war is going to continue for a long time.

280
00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:40,217
I would suggest that you 
understand the historical context

281
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,768
of the conflict between Israel and Palestine.

282
00:12:42,768 --> 00:12:44,449
What is the real reason behind it?

283
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:47,097
I have explained it in detail in this video.

284
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:48,502
You can click to watch it.

285
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:49,640
Thank you very much!
