1
00:00:00,097 --> 00:00:01,620
- "Slab City" is a community

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,390
located in the middle of the desert.

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,210
It has no electricity, no running water,

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,530
and no law enforcement.

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,580
Out of curiosity,

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,940
me and the boys decided to
spend 24 hours in the slabs.

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,410
So we're getting close to Slab City,

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,970
and as you see, there's roads and stuff.

9
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,348
And then once we take
this turn, it's nothing.

10
00:00:17,348 --> 00:00:19,500
No buildings, no nothing.

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,600
So we're on the outskirts of Slab City.

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,160
This right here is "Salvation Mountain."

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,270
It's a tourist attraction,

14
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,790
and they recommend you don't
go any further that way.

15
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,530
It says "keep out," Chandler.

16
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,363
It says...

17
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,473
Ah, I guess there's no laws.

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,100
So we're at the top of Candy Mountain,

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,695
and Slab City is that
way a little bit more.

20
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:48,810
And yeah, guys.

21
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,150
So we discovered this cave
and it has art on the walls.

22
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,290
- I'm not doing it, I'm not going in.

23
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,700
- Chandler, go in.

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,080
Go in! Go!

25
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,913
Chandler!

26
00:00:55,913 --> 00:00:56,746
- This looks like something

27
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:57,780
out of a horror video game.

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,070
- I know.
- A hundred percent.

29
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,420
Ooh, what's in here?

30
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,830
- Dude, I don't want to go in there.

31
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,167
Nope, we're not going in there.

32
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,579
Oh, this is incredible.

33
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,260
Look up, guys. Just look up.

34
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,780
- I have so many questions
about how all this got here,

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,180
like, we're literally in
the middle of a desert.

36
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,617
So we're at the info thing for Slab City,

37
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:16,110
"The Last Free Place on Earth."

38
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,380
Dask Meme. Egor dot.
- E-N-O-D.

39
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,000
- Guys, it's Chris, look.
- Oh, Chris.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,230
- Well, who's FedEx delivering to?

41
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,480
That's what I wanna know.

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,300
Uh, I think we should go now, guys.

43
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,133
- Yeah.
- I agree.

44
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:31,966
- It's kind of creepy.

45
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,180
- Garret.
- Garret.

46
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,786
- Don't.
- Knock.

47
00:01:34,786 --> 00:01:35,846
At least knock.

48
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,630
- I'm not going in there.

49
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,463
Garret, you have fun.

50
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:41,580
I'm going back to the car.

51
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,680
- What is this?
- It's Winnie the Pooh.

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,580
On a grave.

53
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,260
- That was a bad move anyways.

54
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,180
- I don't know where we're going.

55
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,770
- I'm just scared something's
gonna jump out at me

56
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,820
at any second.

57
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,910
- Dude, this is very scary.
- Yeah, let's get outta here.

58
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,960
I'm done.

59
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,393
We're moving on.

60
00:01:57,393 --> 00:02:00,540
- Hey, Garret, look, it's you.
- That's creepy.

61
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,410
- Oh, lit.

62
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,243
You're right.

63
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:03,120
- Does actually look
like Garret, actually.

64
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,990
- All right. Hey, Tareq.

65
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,626
Fly a drone over that so
we can see what's in it.

66
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:10,626
- Okay.

67
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,630
- Next, we're going to an art museum

68
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,450
owned by this guy named Wizard,
in the middle of a desert,

69
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,283
with no laws.

70
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:18,240
- I only have three rules.

71
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,640
One, you don't have to
stay on the carpeting.

72
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,800
Two, everything is touchable.

73
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,020
Three, you touch it and it breaks,

74
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,794
tell 'em it was broke when you got here.

75
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,240
- Bowl in the bowling alley,

76
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,100
all we ask, you put the pins back.

77
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,031
We've been homicide-free for three days.

78
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:35,710
We're shooting for a week.

79
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,780
All right.

80
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,913
- All right, Chris.

81
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,290
You guys are doing Seesaw?
- Yes, sir.

82
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,531
- This is the seesaw here.

83
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:48,960
- I don't think I'm tall enough.

84
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,460
- I don't like this.

85
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,293
- He got scared.

86
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:53,760
- I've been on scary
rides in amusement parks.

87
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,250
- But I've also had straps
on those scary rides, Chris.

88
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,900
- You don't need straps in life, man.

89
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,970
- Don't get down yet, Garret.
- No, I wanna get down.

90
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,170
- No, I go-

91
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,130
- I thought I was gonna die.

92
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,330
Not gonna lie. It was not fun.

93
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,300
I lost my shirt 'cause you
don't need clothes in Slab City.

94
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,903
I'm slab.

95
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,390
Guys, they got memes in here.

96
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,250
- Hypertension, stress, Christmas.

97
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,600
Yes.

98
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,440
Come to the desert.

99
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,270
If you want fire memes.
- It's dangerous.

100
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,580
- First one to use the
bathroom gets 10 grand.

101
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,070
- Hi, he's a good boy.

102
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,406
Ah!

103
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:29,520
Scaredy-cat .

104
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,140
- It's an elephant.

105
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,370
- It's a cage full of Spider-man.

106
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,140
They're free range.
- They look discolored.

107
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,610
- Have Jimmy walk in
the middle of that room

108
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,310
and we're all gonna hide behind a door.

109
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,450
- I'm in a room full of doors

110
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,100
and they're all hiding
behind a random door.

111
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,720
If I pick the door, they're hiding behind.

112
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,983
They owe me a grand.

113
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,540
I don't know what door I opened.

114
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,800
I'm just gonna close that one.

115
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,150
I guess we'll try this one.

116
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:55,050
Can I have my thousand dollars.

117
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,900
Hey boys, go down the scary tunnel first,

118
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,820
so I don't die.

119
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,530
Be my shield, Chandler.

120
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,990
- Hey guys, what the heck is-

121
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,017
What are you doing?

122
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:07,860
- Chandler, you choked so hard.

123
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,200
- It's got a bunch of kazoos in it.

124
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,479
- You won't blow one.
- Please don't, Chris.

125
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,938
- Chris.
- Chris, don't do it.

126
00:04:13,938 --> 00:04:14,771
- Chris.

127
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,675
- This is where the outbreak starts.

128
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:18,150
- So Chris, what do you
think of this place so far?

129
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,170
- I think I wanna live here.

130
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,003
It's beautiful.

131
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:20,836
And it's art.

132
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:22,060
Wait, hold on one more thing.

133
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,950
- They've got a lot of bowling
balls, but not enough water.

134
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,720
- So Garret, what do you
think of this place so far?

135
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,270
- No.
- What do you mean?

136
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,770
- No.
- Okay.

137
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,860
Hey, so Chandler, what do you
think of this place so far?

138
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,840
Chandler?

139
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,990
- What?

140
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,400
- So Chris?
- Yeah. What's up, man?

141
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,740
- This seems a little familiar here.

142
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,566
Did this happen before?
- Yeah.

143
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:46,399
- What happened?

144
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,232
What's happening here.

145
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:48,440
That was back in the desert, right?

146
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,130
So Chris here used to be a boy scout.

147
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,060
- Yes, sir.

148
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,893
- He used to do this all the time.

149
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:52,740
- Chris is the only reason

150
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,420
we're gonna survive this challenge.

151
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,160
Chris, can you heat this up for me?

152
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,360
- Yeah. Hold on.

153
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,350
- I'm hungry.
- Hold on.

154
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,240
- Chris, what do these sticks mean?

155
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,340
- Cheese Butt, come here.
- Don't call me Cheese Butt.

156
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,460
I'm not doing anything if
you call me Cheese Butt.

157
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,522
- If he calls you Cheese Butt.

158
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:05,550
Guys, we don't need Chris.

159
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,383
Let's figure it out.
- Yeah.

160
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:07,770
All right. You heard it.

161
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,870
- Remember what happened
last time you said that.

162
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,043
- Yeah. He helped us.

163
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,130
- So what's your plan
with this, Garret here?

164
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,623
How are you gonna do this tent?

165
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,810
- Chris?
- What's up?

166
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,430
- There's no I in slab, Chris.

167
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,140
When you guys buy merch, use code "Chris."

168
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,550
- Liked that a lot.

169
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,383
- Yeah.

170
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:25,470
- Like I said in that one Twitch video,

171
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,150
whenever you check out at shopmrbeast.

172
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,290
If you put in one of their codes

173
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,550
they get a little kickback.

174
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,650
Here, let me help you with that.

175
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,360
- The easiest part.

176
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,180
- Man, I love Chris.

177
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,540
He just does everything.

178
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,790
- I'm just sick of everybody
relying on me for everything.

179
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,770
Ah, don't go in my tent.

180
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,670
- Thank you for letting me stay-

181
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,270
- No, get outta my tent.

182
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,180
Your shoes are on...

183
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,890
Don't put your shoes in my tent.

184
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,660
I either set up your tent or make food.

185
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,560
So which one do you want?

186
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,200
- Can I just give you a
thousand dollars to do both?

187
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,223
- You heard it, folks.

188
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,240
- There we go.
- Tried to kill me.

189
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,226
- It's out of there.

190
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:06,770
- Yo, Mr Beast!

191
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,450
You rock, brother

192
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,090
- Yeah, I'd rather not be
recognized in Slab City.

193
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,560
I am just a tourist

194
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,413
- Chandler, there's no
McDonald's out here.

195
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,700
- So when are we leaving?

196
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,250
There's no McDonald's out here.

197
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,750
They told me there was restaurants.

198
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,770
They lied to me.

199
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,940
Chris, make the food.

200
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,380
- Might not get any food at all.

201
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,788
- Is there Uber Eats out here?

202
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,950
- Wait. Y'all didn't get me a drink?

203
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,423
- Yeah.
- This happened last time.

204
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:33,720
Why does this keep happening?

205
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,456
- I think it's at Walmart.
- It's at Walmart?

206
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,830
- So what's going on here?

207
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,820
- Walmart sucks.

208
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,170
- Chris said he was an expert.

209
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,430
He lied.

210
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,813
- Well-
- You just got demerited.

211
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:43,980
- Oh, okay.

212
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,630
All right. Figure this out then.

213
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,730
- We did. It doesn't work.

214
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,960
- This does not fit in here.

215
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,730
So Walmart lied to us.

216
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,440
- So are we gonna have to
just make our own fire?

217
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,360
- Or we could ask locals for food.

218
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,816
- Yes. We're gonna have
to make our own fire.

219
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,250
- Somebody's job is to get big sticks.

220
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,110
Somebody's job is to get big rocks.

221
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,400
- Me and Chandler will get rocks.

222
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,420
You and Garret get sticks.

223
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,760
- Why'd you guys pick rocks over sticks.

224
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,260
- Sticks are pokey.

225
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,640
- All right. So you're
getting some stickers.

226
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,340
- Yeah. We're getting some sticks.

227
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,330
I'm sick and I have to do everything

228
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,530
and it's not very fire.
- Thank you, Chris.

229
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:20,340
- Did you just spill all the matches?

230
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,720
- Yeah.

231
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,550
Remember I am sick.

232
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,630
Chandler, can you go away.

233
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,830
You literally have no constructive-

234
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,570
- He told me to come over
here and say dumb things.

235
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,890
You got a couple on the ground.

236
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,290
- I see that, buddy.

237
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,507
- Do we have more food?

238
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:35,730
- I take it you guys just got here?

239
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,580
- Yeah.
- Yes, sir.

240
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,960
- Oh no. No, I just want
to give you guys a heads up

241
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,880
on good stuff.

242
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,620
Okay. You know about the show tonight?

243
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,900
- No.
- There's a show?

244
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,790
- Every Saturday night at sundown.

245
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,030
Open mic, live music, BYOB.

246
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,173
Anybody's skateboard?

247
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,413
- Did you bring...

248
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:55,246
- I didn't bring my skateboard.

249
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:56,852
- You up!

250
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,435
- Anything else?

251
00:07:58,435 --> 00:07:59,595
- That should do it right there.

252
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:00,428
- That should do it. All right.

253
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:01,890
Are you gonna be at the open mic tonight?

254
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,917
- I'll be there for a little while.

255
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:03,750
- Okay. All right.

256
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,865
- I love how you called it open mic.

257
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:07,500
- Yeah, he does...
- He does open mic comedy.

258
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,333
- You do comedy?

259
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,130
Sign up and you go on stage.
- Oh, nice.

260
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,150
- Dude, that'd be so cool.

261
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,500
- That would be cool if you did comedy.

262
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,033
We would like record you.

263
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,565
- Go back to your own country,

264
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:22,843
you son of a .

265
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:24,000
- I heard that one before.

266
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,137
This guy's tearing up our basketball goal.

267
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:27,690
- You're gonna die.

268
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,860
- So far a lot of the people

269
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,180
have actually been really nice to us.

270
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,140
- You're gonna die.

271
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,210
- I guess that guy was just on something

272
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,370
and he just didn't know what was going on.

273
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,350
- Chandler, you ate all the weenies.

274
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,340
- I did not.
- Dude, no,

275
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,003
I saw you eat them all.

276
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:41,460
- Let's play basketball right now.

277
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,828
- I'm not gonna play basketball
'cause I don't like sports.

278
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:55,848
Give me that, boy.

279
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:11,253
- Oh!
- Ooh!

280
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,500
- Hey, I'm cooking some eggs.

281
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,210
- So what kind of eggs are these here?

282
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,190
- Cheesy, scrambled.
- Cheesy, scrambled.

283
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,570
- Yes sir.
- That looks delicious.

284
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,310
Can I go tell the boys the food is ready?

285
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,380
- Yeah. Weren't they having a
fight about food or something?

286
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,430
- Yeah, I think that's the reason

287
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,450
why they're playing.
- Oh.

288
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,560
- So are we all dressed up

289
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,940
and ready to go to the party?
- We are.

290
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,250
And we were just thinking
that going to this party

291
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,170
is the weirdest thing we've ever done.

292
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,270
- Except for the time
we all sat in a circle.

293
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,400
- Or the time we were in straight-jackets

294
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,233
in the insane asylum.

295
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:41,070
- What about the time we
counted to a hundred thousand?

296
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,070
Oh, that was just me.
- I went to Ohio.

297
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,113
- That's pretty crazy.

298
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:46,710
- That old man with the
beard came over here

299
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,760
and told us there's a party.

300
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,470
- Wait, the old man
told us about the party.

301
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,850
- Yeah.
- Oh, great.

302
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,590
- It's my kind of party.

303
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,090
- We scoped it out with the drone.

304
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,980
It looks pretty good.

305
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,817
- It was lit up.
- Yeah.

306
00:09:56,817 --> 00:09:57,900
- And there was empty seats.

307
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,180
Apparently it was a
show or like a open mic.

308
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,260
- And there was lights.

309
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,910
So yeah, we're going.
- That's all it takes.

310
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,661
Lights?
- We like lights.

311
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:05,869
♪ Baby, I can't sleep. ♪

312
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:23,850
- I just signed up for the open mic here

313
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,100
and I'm gonna try to do
some stand up comedy.

314
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,767
If I'm doing bad, just get the car ready.

315
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,790
- I was actually born in Saudi Arabia.

316
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,623
Do you guys know where that is?

317
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:37,620
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

318
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,290
First memory was that all the
women there dressed the same.

319
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,000
They covered everything except their eyes.

320
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,250
My second memory was
that I kept losing my mom

321
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,800
in retail stores.

322
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,060
- Thank you guys so much.

323
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,900
Thank you for letting me doing this.

324
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,250
I appreciate it.

325
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,660
- To be honest, I was not expecting this.

326
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,830
There's kinda like a community

327
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,480
and everyone here just seems super chill.

328
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,440
- They were playing a lot of music

329
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,580
that I really enjoy and love.

330
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,080
I had no clue that something like this

331
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,970
was gonna be just randomly
in the middle of the desert.

332
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,050
- For a place with no laws,

333
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,910
this is actually pretty chill.

334
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,650
And it's kinda like a community,

335
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,730
everyone's getting along.

336
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,960
I'm just kind of surprised

337
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,973
in the middle of the desert you have this.

338
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:22,590
- There's a lot of different
people out here, you know?

339
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,423
- This is awesome.

340
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:24,360
I honestly didn't expect this.

341
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,500
I didn't wanna come
here in the first place,

342
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,060
but this, crazy.

343
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,530
- You wanna go dance, I'll donate.

344
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,980
- I can't.
- Let's go do it.

345
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,420
♪ Out in stormy weather. ♪

346
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,246
- All right, boys.

347
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,480
I'm staying here.

348
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,100
I'm gonna live here.
- No

349
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,698
- Garret, you wouldn't
last five seconds out here.

350
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:50,531
- Whoa.

351
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:52,200
- We've been out here for 24 hours, dude.

352
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,990
- Yeah, you wouldn't last
five more seconds out here.

353
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,503
- Yeah, you're right.

354
00:11:58,046 --> 00:11:58,973
- All right.
- Oh, I was right.

355
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,350
- Garret's gone.

356
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,880
- What if three-knife guy comes back?

357
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,620
- What if you literally just popped up

358
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,900
right behind you and
grabbed you by the throat?

359
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,280
- I mean it's my time to go

360
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,230
and get stabbed with three rusty knife.

361
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,063
- I'm sorry, dude.

362
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,360
If you're listening, we don't mean this.

363
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,193
- I thought you said

364
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:14,970
you wanted to live here, man.

365
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,620
- Yeah. I talked to some of the locals.

366
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,870
They denounced three-knife men.

367
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,130
- They don't like him.
- No, they don't like him.

368
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,770
- Chris wanted to go up on
stage and dance with somebody.

369
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,780
- I didn't wanna go on stage, you liar.

370
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,910
- But he can't dance so he chickened out,

371
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,230
and now we're making fun of him for it.

372
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,730
- Wow. Great play-by-play.

373
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,040
Who are you? Joe Madden.

374
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,194
- Oh my goodness.

375
00:12:34,194 --> 00:12:35,340
Chandler, you might as well just walk

376
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,840
into the abyss after that one.

377
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,907
- All right. See you guys.

378
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:39,470
I'm outta here.

379
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,640
- So the boys don't
understand how this works.

380
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,370
You can't just approach to Slab City

381
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,720
and just be like, "Yo, dance with me."

382
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,847
They have to accept you.

383
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:48,120
And so he was-
- You can't dance.

384
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,042
- You don't know if he was
vibing with me or not, man.

385
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:52,920
- You just can't dance.
- You can't dance.

386
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,600
- Oh God, no.
- Stop it, man.

387
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,460
Honestly don't care if
Chris can or can't dance

388
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,660
but I just like making fun of him.

389
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,310
So it's really funny that he didn't dance.

390
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,150
- I'm gonna be honest.

391
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,920
Chris is starting to get arrogant,

392
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,880
'cause he built the tents.

393
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,110
It happens every time.

394
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,390
I was told to talk about
how Chris didn't dance.

395
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,380
Haha, Chris

396
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,300
- He won't do it 'cause
he can't dance either.

397
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,133
- Yeah, I know.

398
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:10,966
That's literally what I was thinking.

399
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:12,900
Why would I make fun of
him when I can't dance?

400
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,530
So I'm in the tent and I'm not gonna lie.

401
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,550
I feel exhausted.

402
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,685
It's been a pretty fun day.

403
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:21,092
I'm gonna go to bed soon.

404
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,070
- All right, guys, it's been a long day.

405
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,033
I'm pretty tired.

406
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,030
Okay. God is telling me to go to sleep.

407
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,710
- It was a crazy experience,
but it's time for bed.

408
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,543
So peace out.

409
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:30,660
- I think I'm gonna hit the hay.

410
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,493
I'm not gonna lie,

411
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:32,326
I'm not feeling too well.

412
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm gonna go ahead and go to bed.

413
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,559
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

414
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,710
I am not feeling too good.

415
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,543
I'm really sick.

416
00:13:38,543 --> 00:13:40,500
I think I need to go to like
the doctor or something.

417
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,418
You guys look cute
spooning together though.

418
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:44,910
- Scoot off.

419
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,470
- Seriously. I'm feeling really bad.

420
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,870
I think I might have a fever.
- What happened?

421
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,860
- We'll get you some meds

422
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,090
and we'll get you to-

423
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,510
Chris is apparently sick, even worse now.

424
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,700
So we gotta go take him to the doctor.

425
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,560
- Yeah. I get kidney stones really bad.

426
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,020
I've had three within like the last year.

427
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,790
Shout out to kidney stones, I guess

428
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,020
- We picked up the campsite.

429
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,130
We're gonna skirt-skirt out.

430
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,090
Take care of Chris.

431
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,830
So apparently, Chandler,

432
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,620
the only thing dangerous about Slab City

433
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,389
is Chris's kidney stones
- And three-knife man

434
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,880
- And three-knife man.
