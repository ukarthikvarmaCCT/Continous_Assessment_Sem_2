So hey guys,my name is Gaurav Chaudhary ,You are watching Technical Guruji

9
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:25,715

10
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:40,095
So guys this is the colorful box of the JIO Phone

00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:40,595
and here you have peshwa bajirao

00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,005
And here you get info about the Jio Cable

15
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:52,875
with which you can connect jio phone to your Television

16
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,905
 

17
00:00:55,905 --> 00:00:57,775
here you have some technical specifications

18
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:01,155
Here you have highlights about jio services in this phone

19
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:01,775
 

20
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:04,985
You can see movies,TV get music in this little phone

21
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:07,835
 

22
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,260
when you open the box you can see the black jio phone

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,955
let us put it aside,you get some more accesories

24
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:16,515
you have some guides,you have a charger

25
00:01:16,515 --> 00:01:18,375
with micro usb connector

26
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:21,515
with an output rate  of 5v and 700 mili amperes

27
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,215
we also have a big 2000 mAH battery

28
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:27,405
It is big because it gives your phone a lot of capacity

29
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:30,295
and you only have this much,what else can you expect from a 1500rs phone

30
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:32,500
getting a phone is a great thing

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,005
so lets boot the phone

32
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:35,800
first we have to insert the sim card

33
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,800
and then we will insert the battery

34
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,175
and along with the sim you can also insert a memory card upto 128 GB

35
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:45,900
So we will talk about the phone's physical overview while the phone is booting

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,915
 

37
00:01:47,915 --> 00:01:50,915
you get a 2.4 inch QVGS screen

38
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:52,400
there is not gorilla glass but,

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,200
by the weight you can say that the durability

40
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,575
can also be compared with an Iphone

41
00:01:58,575 --> 00:02:01,475
down you get a 1234567890 keypad

42
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:04,375
on the upper side of the phone you get a torchlight

43
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,785
on the back side you have a 2 megapixel camera along with a loud speaker

44
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,795
on the front side you have a 0.3 megapixel camera

45
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:13,325
below you get a micro usb connector

46
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:16,125
with a 3.5 mm audio jack

47
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:18,195
as I told you you can remove the back of the phone too

48
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:19,145
 

49
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:22,425
and that's it for the physical overview

50
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:25,320
when you boot the phone

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,315
it is written "powered by Kai OS"

52
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:28,585
 

53
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,615
it is a different type of OS based on

54
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:31,235
 

55
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,665
here you will get a feeling

56
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:34,205
of android at some heights

57
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:36,200
if you go to settings and all

58
00:02:37,295 --> 00:02:39,955
because even if this phone is cheap as 1500

59
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:41,000
you get very good options

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,895
first of all you get many apps

61
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:47,895

62
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:48,865
 

63
00:02:48,865 --> 00:02:50,865
 

64
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:51,945
and you get the basic apps

65
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:54,635
which all the other phones have

66
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:57,315
EG. Calculator

67
00:02:57,315 --> 00:03:00,215
wireless radio and unit converter

68
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:03,165
obviously calls and messaging

69
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:04,800
you also get some shortcuts

70
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,315
if you try pressing the D-pad

71
00:03:06,315 --> 00:03:07,685
left,right,up and down

72
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:10,295
you can get into different apps

73
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:11,405
 

74
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:13,765
in setting you also get support for

75
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:14,665
wi-fi,bluetooth,NFC and GPS

76
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:17,945
 

77
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:21,055
only thing that is not there is wifi hotspot

78
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:22,280
we hope we'll get it in the next updates

79
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,325
 

80
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:27,245
you also get Jio money in this phone

81
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:28,800
you can also make video calls through this phone

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
you also get option for S.O.S

83
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,045
if you hold the no.5 button for a while

84
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:37,180
you can give a message to your favorite contacts

85
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,625
in fact you can also send your jio location

86
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,635
 

87
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:44,585
there are many things in this phone

88
00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:45,100
there are many apps too

89
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,600
In fact

90
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,725
you can also browse websites

91
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:49,785
 

92
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:52,105
 

93
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:54,845
but it would be better if I don't talk much in this video

94
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:57,505
it would be much better if you use this phone yourself and

95
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:00,185
you explore your jio phone

96
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:03,175
my opinions:

97
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:06,335
we all know that no one provides these features at this value

98
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:09,255
and these 1500rs.

99
00:04:09,255 --> 00:04:11,255
will get back to you when you

100
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:12,295
return the phone to Jio after 3 years

101
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:15,385
but the main problem is

102
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:18,255
about the availability because the demand is very much

103
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:20,375
so if you haven't booked it yet then book it right now

104
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,325
 

105
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:26,285
I think that this phone can turn the people of India

106
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:28,200
on your side of Internet

107
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,425
who played the snake game in Nokia 1100

108
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:34,185
but because of jio phone's live tv, movies

109
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:34,885
the can connect

110
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:36,665
to internet

111
00:04:36,665 --> 00:04:39,685
so this is an awesome option

112
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:42,095
but no use for me

113
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:43,760
because there is no Jio network in Dubai

114
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,105
so one of you viewers is gonna get

115
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:47,875
you just have to comment what did you like about this phone

116
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,875
you also have to like and shower your love

117
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,975
and also share this video

118
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:56,965
and subscribe the channel if you want to show your love and also press the bell

119
00:04:56,965 --> 00:05:00,015
if you wont no problem but if you will then I'll feel good

120
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:03,025
that's all for the video

121
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:05,925
I hope you liked the video

122
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:08,455
if you have any questions or suggestions about the jio phone

123
00:05:08,455 --> 00:05:11,415
if you havent liked or shared then also like and share

124
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:14,175
and dont forget to subscribe the channel because

125
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:16,000
I bring videos like this EVERYDAY!!!!!

126
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,445
JAI HIND ,VANDE MAATRAM

127
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,445
 

128
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,445
 

129
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:24,445
