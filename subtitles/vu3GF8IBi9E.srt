Getting late?

14
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:26,548

16
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:31,563
I'm starting to get afraid of gym.

Why don't you want to join the gym?

22
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:42,516

28
00:01:05,617 --> 00:01:06,016
Hey!

29

You don't do it like that.

00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:38,668
Chest out.

112
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:33,851
Not like that!

113
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:35,327
First make a fist.

114
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:36,640

115
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:39,382

135
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:16,022
She is a 21st century gym girl.

And the world belongs to her!

137
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:21,529
