1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,129
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,129 --> 00:00:04,895
26th April, 1986 at 1:23 AM,

3
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:11,356
the Reactor Number 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Soviet Union.

4
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:14,394
The lid on top of the reactor starts shaking,

5
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:17,143
And the shockwaves are felt all throughout the building.

6
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,186
The workers present realised that

7
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,615
the nuclear reaction in the reactor

8
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:24,046
was completely out of control by then.

9
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:26,270
And that reactor had to be stopped quickly.

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,632
So one of those workers acted fast

11
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:31,255
and pressed the Emergency Shut Down button.

12
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:34,595
By pressing the button, the control rods were designed to enter the reactors,

13
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:36,427
and prevent the reactions.

14
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:37,903
But they didn't work as designed.

15
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:41,437
After the button was pressed, the control rods entered the reactor,

16
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:44,868
but as soon as they went in, there was a huge blast.

17
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:46,191
A huge explosion.

18
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:49,332
After this blast, the reactor was engulfed in flames.

19
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:52,476
The harmful radioactive material present there

20
00:00:52,476 --> 00:00:54,933
rose up into the air with the flames.

21
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:59,558
The amount of harmful radioactive material released in this disaster,

22
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,631
was equal to 400 Hiroshima atomic bomb.

23
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:08,755
This disaster is still considered to be the World's Worst Nuclear Disaster.

24
00:01:08,755 --> 00:01:10,926
The radiation spreading through the air,

25
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:16,156
had an effect on not only Ukraine but all over Europre from Spain to Sweden also.

26
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:19,453
There was radioactive rain in the United Kingdom.

27
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:22,676
The radioactive dust which settled on the grass in the hills,

28
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:24,181
were consumed by cows

29
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:27,867
and the amount of radiation in the milk of those cows spiked.

30
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:31,302
Due to this, thousands of children got Thyroid Cancer.

31
00:01:31,302 --> 00:01:32,975
Come, in this video,

32
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:35,467
let's understand why this Chernobyl disaster took place.

33
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:37,046
The reasons behind it,

34
00:01:37,046 --> 00:01:39,843
and the effects that were seen all over the world.

35
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:42,666
"In a nuclear accident near the Soviet Union..."

36
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,583
"...once Reactor 4, the scene of a total meltdown..."

37
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:48,120
"The explosion at a nuclear plant in the Soviet Union."

38
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,687
"Near the reactor at Ukraine's Chernobyl Power Plant."

39
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:55,111
"...the ecplosion's powerful enough to blow up the steel and concrete lid."

40
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:58,542
Friends, after World War II,

41
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:01,897
the Sovient Union invested a lot of money in nuclear power plants.

42
00:02:01,897 --> 00:02:04,107
It built many nuclear power plants

43
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:06,513
on of which was the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.

44
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:08,157
It's official name was

45
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:12,569
It was built in the early 1970s,

46
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,693
even though it is named the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant,

47
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:17,727
it wasn't built in the city of Chernobyl.

48
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:19,372
Chernobyl was a small city

49
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:22,304
approx 16 km away from this nuclear power plant.

50
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:23,990
But friends, this Chernobyl Plant

51
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,186
was among one of the most advanced

52
00:02:26,186 --> 00:02:27,553
nuclear power plants in the Sovient Union.

53
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:29,540
There were four nuclear reactors in this,

54
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,945
in the RBMK 1000 design.

55
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:35,224
RBMK 1000 is a type of nuclear reactor.

56
00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:38,512
The operations of the first 2 reactors had begun in 1977,

57
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:40,044
the third in 1981,

58
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:41,677
and the fourth in 1983.

59
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:44,230
The purpose of power plants is to generate electricity.

60
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,176
In this case, each reactor could produce 1,000 Megawatts electricity. 

61
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:50,306
The four reactors could together

62
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:54,125
supply electricity to meet 10% of Ukaraine's electricity demand.

63
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,029
So you can imagine how powerful these reactors were.

64
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:59,073
Coming to the Chernobyl disaster,

65
00:02:59,073 --> 00:03:01,298
this disaster took place in the Reactor Number 4,

66
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:03,737
during a routine safety test.

67
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:06,269
To understand exactly what had happened that day,

68
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,834
we first need to understand how a nuclear reactor works.

69
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:12,533
In most of the methods of generating electricity

70
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:15,789
in the simplest terms, you need a rotating wheel.

71
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:18,809
You need movement for kinetic energy.

72
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:21,906
In hydroelectricity, when the water falls from above,

73
00:03:21,906 --> 00:03:23,183
it moves the wheels,

74
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:24,271
and creates energy.

75
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,979
In wind energy, the wind moves the turbine,

76
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,078
which produces energy once it starts rotating.

77
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,608
In thermal powerplants,

78
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:32,095
that uses coal to generate electricity

79
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:34,936
steam is released by buring the coals,

80
00:03:34,936 --> 00:03:36,976
and the steam later moves the wheels.

81
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:38,763
The kinetic energy is thus generated.

82
00:03:38,763 --> 00:03:40,540
Even in case of nuclear energy,

83
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,462
the wheel is moved by steam.

84
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:46,083
But to make that steam, water has to be heated up first,

85
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,887
whereas in thermal energy, coal heats up the water,

86
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:50,571
in nuclear energy,

87
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:52,277
the nuclear reactions taking place

88
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:53,420
heats up the water.

89
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,804
Look at this diagram from a school book.

90
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:57,740
You don't need to get into the details,

91
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,418
you can see a turbine that is rotated by steam.

92
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:02,586
And the steam is generated

93
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:04,931
because the nuclear reaction heats up the water.

94
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:07,437
This water acts as a coolant as well.

95
00:04:07,437 --> 00:04:09,987
To prevent overheating around the reactor,

96
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:12,336
the constant supply of water is a must.

97
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:16,866
In the Chernobyl plant, the water came from a nearby man-made water reserve.

98
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:18,870
There was a river beside it too.

99
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,926
It is important to have a consistent supply of water at all times.

100
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:27,454
For this, the water pumps pushing the water into the pipes,

101
00:04:27,454 --> 00:04:28,881
should be working non-stop.

102
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:31,709
But what happens in case of a power cut?

103
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:34,753
To ensure that the water pumps keep working at all times,

104
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:37,909
There were some backup diesel generators in the Chernobyl plant.

105
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:40,451
So that they could provide uninterrupted electricity to the pumps.

106
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:42,786
But to start these generators,

107
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:44,270
it took about 1 or 2 minutes.

108
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,250
Within those 1-2 minutes,

109
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,658
there was a need for an additional power source to ensure that the water pumps keep working.

110
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:52,098
The builders of Chernobyl reactor had said that

111
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:55,053
the electricity needed for these crucial 1-2 minutes,

112
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:57,127
could be sourced from the nuclear reactor itself.

113
00:04:57,127 --> 00:05:00,671
Since the turbines would be moving because of the steam,

114
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:03,769
and even after a reactor shutdown, there would be some amount of steam,

115
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:05,444
that would last for a couple of minutes,

116
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:07,748
would be enough to power those plants.

117
00:05:07,748 --> 00:05:10,189
So friends, in the wee hours of 26 April,

118
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:12,044
they were testing this.

119
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:13,681
If there was a power cut,

120
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:17,173
would the turbines be able to produce enough electricity

121
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:19,592
to power the water pumps?

122
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:21,505
Tihs test was run earlier as well,

123
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:25,101
but this test was never successful in reactor number 4.

124
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:29,140
The workers hoped that the test would be successful that ill-fated night.

125
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,721
One day before this, on 25th April,

126
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:33,922
they had tried to conduct a test,
but it couldn't be carried out.

127
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:35,636
And so the test was delayed by a day.

128
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,908
The workers working in this plant

129
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:39,354
didn't even get full sleep,

130
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:42,010
At 11:10 PM on 25th April,

131
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,471
they began the preparations for this test.

132
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:46,509
To understand the rest of the story,

133
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,591
we need to understand the science of reactors for a bit,

134
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:52,540
The process of the nuclear reaction in the nuclear reactor.

135
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,386
The core of the nuclear reactors, the main part,

136
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:56,895
is mainly built of three things.

137
00:06:00,283 --> 00:06:02,417
Fure rods are basically nuclear fuel,

138
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:04,360
which causes the nuclear reactions.

139
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,996
In this case, Uranium Dioxide

140
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:09,219
enriched with Uranium 235 Isotope.

141
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:12,820
We know that an atom is built of electrons, protons, and neutrons,

142
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,515
and each element has a different number of electrons, protons, and neutrons.

143
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:18,991
Several elements have isotopes as well.

144
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:21,880
Isotopes are basically a type of variations in the elements.

145
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,927
Take the element Uranium,

146
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:25,570
which has three isotopes,

147
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,676
Uranium-238, Uranium-235, and Uranium-234.

148
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:30,356
In different isotopes,

149
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,614
the number of protons remains the same,

150
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:32,965
but they have different number of neutrons.

151
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:35,278
But there are some rare isotopes,

152
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:36,674
of some elements,

153
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:38,996
that can undergo the nuclear fission reactions.

154
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:42,527
Uranium-235 is an isotope of Uranium

155
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,192
which permits nuclear fission reaction

156
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:46,805
and create nuclear energy.

157
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:49,598
This Uranium isotope is unstable

158
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:52,485
due to which it falls apart and released radiations.

159
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:54,940
This keeps on disintegrating on its own

160
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,996
but it can also be broken apart if a neutron collides with it.

161
00:06:57,996 --> 00:07:01,518
Both cases are known as a nuclear fission reaction.

162
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:05,086
In this process, one atom of this element splits into two

163
00:07:05,086 --> 00:07:07,447
and a few extra lonesome neutrons are formed.

164
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:09,922
Additionally, it releases kinetic energy as well

165
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:11,486
that converts into thermal energy

166
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:14,122
which later goes on to move the turbine.

167
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:16,207
But the extra neutrons that are realeased,

168
00:07:16,207 --> 00:07:18,377
go and collide with more atoms

169
00:07:18,377 --> 00:07:20,035
and such disintegration continues,

170
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:22,223
and just like that, a chain reaction begins.

171
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:24,418
It is known as Nuclear Chain Reaction.

172
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:26,574
To slow down this reaction,

173
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:28,922
Control rods are used.

174
00:07:28,922 --> 00:07:32,365
In this case, the control rods were made of Boron Carbide.

175
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,514
Boron is an element which

176
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:36,886
absorbs neutrons quite well.

177
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:39,861
The extra neutrons formed as a result of the nuclear fission reaction

178
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:41,837
get absorbed by Boron,

179
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,173
and do not collide with the other atoms,

180
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,921
and the speed of the nuclear fission reaction slows down.

181
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:49,696
In the core of a nuclear reactor,

182
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:52,419
when the fuel rods are inserted,

183
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:55,756
the control rods are inserted beside it,

184
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:58,252
to control the nuclear reaction.

185
00:07:58,252 --> 00:08:00,752
The more the control rods are inserted,

186
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:02,757
the reaction will be proportionately slowed down.

187
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:05,835
Apart from this, the third thing that I told you about, the Moderator.

188
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:08,571
In this case, graphite blocks were the moderators.

189
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,101
These help to speed up the reaction.

190
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:16,166
Graphite slows down the energy of the neutrons,

191
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:20,197
increasing the chances of neutrons colliding more with Uranium atoms.

192
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:22,077
Thus, increasing the speed of the reaction.

193
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:24,550
Today, most of the nuclear plants

194
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,097
water is used as moderator.

195
00:08:27,097 --> 00:08:30,894
But in the RBMK 1000 reactors used in Chernobyl back then,

196
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:33,409
graphite was used as Moderator.

197
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,480
To summarised the science of it,

198
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,615
imagine a car on a road

199
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:41,289
If you hit the gas pedal, the speed of the car will increase.

200
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:44,028
And if you hit the brakes, it will slow down and eventually stop.

201
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:47,876
In case of the nuclear reactor, the car moving on the road

202
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:50,986
is the fuel rods of Uranium where the reaction takes place.

203
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:53,116
The gas pedal works are the Moderator,

204
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,871
The deeper you insert it, the reaction would be sped up

205
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:58,341
and the control rods act as the brakes.

206
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:00,584
when you hit the brakes, it'll slow down the reaction.

207
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:03,494
The after effect of the Chernobyl disaster

208
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:07,904
was worse that that caused by the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

209
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:10,572
Today, you can see the live examples of it.

210
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:13,048
The disaster zone of Chernobyl

211
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:14,367
is so dangerous that people cannot go there.

212
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:15,820
It is a restricted area.

213
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,238
But the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

214
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:19,776
are populated by so many people.

215
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,579
on that ill-fated night, 26th April,

216
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:25,536
the workers were testing the unit.

217
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:28,231
Workers were tasked with

218
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:35,265
reducing the output of the nuclear power plant from 1,600 MW of electricity to 700 MW.

219
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:38,497
But as soon as the workers inserted the control rods,

220
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:39,866
the power dropped even more.

221
00:09:39,866 --> 00:09:43,366
It fell below their expectations.

222
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:45,000
And reached 30 MW.

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,335
The workers working there couldn't comprehend why it happened.

224
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:51,219
The reason for this was that in this nuclear fission reaction,

225
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:52,609
a byproduct was created

226
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:54,044
Xenon 135.

227
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:58,729
Similar to Boron, Xenon 135 could absorb the neutrons quite efficiently.

228
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:01,698
Because this byproduct was being created in this reaction,

229
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:04,018
it was absorbing the excess neutrons,

230
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:05,761
and the brakes were being hit quite hard.

231
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:08,620
That's why the electricity produced was lower than expected.

232
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,927
Normally when Xenon is produced in a nuclear reaction,

233
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,243
it burns out on its own.

234
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:15,057
Or decays within a few hours.

235
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:18,806
But in this case, it kept getting accumulated in the nuclear core,

236
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:21,007
because the power output was already so low.

237
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:24,650
When high amounts of Xenon starts accumulating in the reactor core,

238
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,157
it is known as Xenon poisoning.

239
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:27,898
It kept slowing down the reaction.

240
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:31,051
Seeing that very little electricity was produced,

241
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:33,568
the shift supervisor, Anatoly,

242
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:37,530
ordered the workers to take out some of the control rods.

243
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,434
He reasoned that taking out the control rods could speed up the reactions a bit.

244
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:42,498
At 1:00 AM on 26th April,

245
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:45,717
the power output reached 200 MW after taking out some of the control rods.

246
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:48,293
But they still couldn't run their tests,

247
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:51,159
Because they aimed to take the output to 700 MW.

248
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,202
They had to speed up the reaction further.

249
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:54,965
Anatoly gave the next set of instructions.

250
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:58,803
He wanted to speed up the reactions by taking out more control rods.

251
00:10:58,803 --> 00:11:02,153
There are normally 211 control rods in a reactor,

252
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:04,919
All but 8 of them were taken out.

253
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:07,251
Only 8 control rods remained in the reaction chamber.

254
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,818
This was a violation of the safety protocols,

255
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:11,909
because it was clearly written in the rule book

256
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:15,715
that under any circumstances, there should not be fewer than 15 control rods in the reactor.

257
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:19,169
But here, there were only 8 control rods in the reactor.

258
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:21,993
Due to this, the power output spiked up.

259
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:23,481
At 01:19 AM,

260
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:26,955
because the control rods were abruptly taken out,

261
00:11:26,955 --> 00:11:29,151
the reaction spiked suddenly.

262
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,086
The power output increased rapidly,

263
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:33,575
and whatever little water was present in the core,

264
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:35,644
turned into steam.

265
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:39,183
It also meant that the amount of water in the reactor core kept decreasing.

266
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:41,401
Remember, water was supposed to work as the coolant.

267
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,135
A positive feedback loop was created here.

268
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:46,569
As the water turned into steam,

269
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:49,010
it couldn't act as the coolant,

270
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,228
resulting in the reaction gaining more speed.

271
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:52,927
A fun fact here,

272
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:55,788
to avoid this positive feedback loop,

273
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:57,944
in the present-day nuclear reactors,

274
00:11:57,944 --> 00:12:01,259
water is used as a coolant and as a moderator both.

275
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:03,331
So even if the amount of water decreases,

276
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:05,282
the moderator will also decrease,

277
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:07,507
so this will be the same as taking your foot off of the accelerator.

278
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:09,512
And it would result in a negative feedback loop.

279
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:13,090
But in this RBMK reactor, graphite was the moderator,

280
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,166
and the water was turning into steam rapidly.

281
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,499
The Xenon present in the reactor till then

282
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:21,161
which was working to slow down the reaction,

283
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:23,533
burned out when the reaction sped up.

284
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:27,080
So there were no more Xenons to absorb the neutrons.

285
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,802
This was the point of Extreme Power Surge.

286
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:32,543
The speed of the nuclear reaction increased exponentially.

287
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,685
A lot of steam was being produced here,

288
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:37,487
and the lid of the containment structure,

289
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:38,549
started shaking.

290
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,766
Shockwaves were felt throughout the building.

291
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:43,957
Workers realised that they have to execute an emergency stop.

292
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:46,091
So they pressed the Emergency Stop button.

293
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:47,740
It was at 01:23 AM.

294
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,447
Pressing this button meant that

295
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:52,220
the control rods would be reinserted into the reactor,

296
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,087
to slow down the reaction.

297
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:57,350
At a glance, it would feel like a logical step,

298
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,523
since our car is going at a high speed,

299
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:02,143
we need to slam the brakes to slow it down.

300
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:04,574
But there was a design flaw in this reactor.

301
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:07,543
A design flaw related to the control rods.

302
00:13:07,543 --> 00:13:09,475
A control rod is actually made up of two parts.

303
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:12,285
The main part of the control rod is made of Boron,

304
00:13:12,285 --> 00:13:15,864
it slows down the reaction by absorbing the Neutrons.

305
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:18,209
But the tip of the control rods,

306
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:19,609
were made of graphite.

307
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:21,968
The same graphite that was used as a moderator in the reaction.

308
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,753
That worked by speeding up the reaction.

309
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:26,217
As soon as the button was pressed,

310
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:29,050
and the remaining control rods were inserted into the reactor,

311
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,230
the control rods with their graphite tips.

312
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,493
This caused a blast.

313
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:39,239
The graphite infinitely sped up the already speeding reaction.

314
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:43,242
The power generation of the reactor reached 33,000 MW.

315
00:13:43,242 --> 00:13:47,581
The first blast was 6 to 8 seconds after the emergency button was pressed.

316
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:52,001
Because of this blast, the core of the reactor started melting.

317
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,478
After 2-3 seconds,

318
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:56,147
there was an even more powerful blast.

319
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:59,095
The 1,000-tonne lid on top of the structure,

320
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:00,442
was blown into the air.

321
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:03,836
The radioactive material started spreading through the atmosphere.

322
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:06,155
The reason behind the second blast is said to be

323
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:09,607
the graphite present in the reactor started burning.

324
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:11,097
It combusted as well.

325
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:14,168
Two people were instantly killed in this blast.

326
00:14:14,168 --> 00:14:19,307
But more than 100 radioactive elements
and 5% Uranium fuel,

327
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:22,442
there were 192 tonnes of Uranium fuel in the reactor,

328
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:23,718
went into the atmosphere.

329
00:14:23,718 --> 00:14:26,978
At 01:26 AM the fire alarm began ringing.

330
00:14:26,978 --> 00:14:29,042
Firefighters reached the spot.

331
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:32,985
Initially, the firefighters didn't have an idea of what was happening there.

332
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:34,795
When they reached the place,

333
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:36,979
they assumed it was a normal fire,

334
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:38,585
and started trying to put it out with water.

335
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:41,228
But this fire was caused due to graphite.

336
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:43,393
It wasn't about to die down easily.

337
00:14:43,393 --> 00:14:46,515
It took more than 10 days to put out this fire.

338
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:49,019
Helicopters were called in to drop

339
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,977
thousands of tonnes of clay, sand, Boron, and lead from the sky.

340
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,352
These elements can reduce the spread of radiation.

341
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:59,569
But it was extremely difficult to do this.

342
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:02,719
Because to drop the elements on the fire,

343
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,613
the helicopter would need to fly right on top of it.

344
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,472
A truly dangerous task.

345
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,884
One of the helicopters crashed due to this.

346
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:10,601
Killing four people.

347
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:12,532
The firefighters who had reached to put out the fire,

348
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:16,422
experienced fatigue and nauseous after they went home.

349
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:19,020
Symptoms of Radiation Sickness.

350
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,261
When you are exposed to an extreme high dose of radiation,

351
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:25,243
these symptoms begin appearing indicating that

352
00:15:25,243 --> 00:15:27,773
you will die in a few months.

353
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:29,946
The thing about radiation is that

354
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:32,464
the more you are exposed to radiation,

355
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,480
the deadlier it is.

356
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,761
About 28 of these firefighters passed away within a few months.

357
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:42,665
People who were exposed to comparatively less radiation,

358
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:44,292
died in a couple of years,

359
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:46,752
and those who were exposed even less,

360
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:50,494
developed diseases like cancer within 10 years.

361
00:15:50,494 --> 00:15:53,643
Coming back to the reactor, the fire had died down after 10 days,

362
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:58,197
But this reactor was producing high levels of heat even after the fire died down.

363
00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:00,002
It couldn't be controlled.

364
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:04,385
Due to this heat, the base of the reactor started cracking.

365
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:07,155
It was highly problematic.

366
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:10,145
Because there was a water tank under the reactor.

367
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:11,962
Filled with radioactive water.

368
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:15,138
If the reactor producing high levels of heat

369
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:17,063
came in contact with the water,

370
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,726
the water would have instantly converted into steam.

371
00:16:19,726 --> 00:16:22,177
When temperatures are so high,

372
00:16:22,177 --> 00:16:24,659
that water is instantly converted into steam,

373
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,899
this leads to an explosion.

374
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:29,147
If you'd recall your Chemistry lessons,

375
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:32,894
liquids occupy lesser space than gas.

376
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:35,182
Since the atoms are more spread out when in a gaseous form.

377
00:16:35,182 --> 00:16:37,060
They require more space.

378
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,957
When the water converts into steam suddenly,

379
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,460
there is often no space for the steam to exit.

380
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,666
Because there isn't one, it leads to an explosion.

381
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,520
They were wary of a third blast.

382
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,141
One that'd be bigger than the previous two.

383
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:54,492
This blast would mean even more radioactive material being spread.

384
00:16:54,492 --> 00:16:57,211
There was only one way to prevent this from happening.

385
00:16:57,211 --> 00:17:02,262
A person had to dive into the radioactive water tank,

386
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:04,244
and drain the radioactive water out of the reactor.

387
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:07,304
To do this, a real-life hero was needed.

388
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:09,074
The water was radioactive.

389
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:10,688
Anyone diving into the water,

390
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:13,829
would be in a danger throughout their remaining life.

391
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,494
They may die within a few years.

392
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,782
Or even within a few months.

393
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:22,453
They had to literally risk their lives to carry out the task.

394
00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:24,632
We had three such heroes.

395
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:32,110
On 4th May, 1986,

396
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,501
wearing simple diving equipment,

397
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:36,557
they dived into the water tank.

398
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:39,907
They swam in the dark guided by only one lamp.

399
00:17:39,907 --> 00:17:42,730
They located the valves that had to be opened

400
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,462
to drain the water.

401
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:48,291
These three heroes are so important in our story that you'd find it difficult to believe.

402
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,063
Because it is said that had the third explosion taken place,

403
00:17:51,063 --> 00:17:55,101
it would've been so dangerous that it might have killed millions of people.

404
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:57,185
For the next 500,000 years,

405
00:17:57,185 --> 00:18:00,678
almost the entirety of the European continent would've become uninhabitable.

406
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:03,783
The good news is that all three divers survived.

407
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:07,476
Boris passed away in 2005 due to a heart attack.

408
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:11,166
Alexei and Valeri are still alive.

409
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,846
Once this risk was dealt with,

410
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:17,221
the next step was to clean up the radioactive waste lying there.

411
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:22,054
Initially, the officers of the Soviet Union used remote-controlled robots to do this.

412
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:26,105
But the robots started breaking down near the radioactive waste.

413
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,982
Thousands of people had to be sent in to clean up.

414
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:32,064
They were known as the liquidators.

415
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:34,670
During 1986-1987,

416
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,585
200,000 liquidators were dispatched to actively clean up this area.

417
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,031
When the fire caused by the blast was being put out,

418
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:46,228
The Soviet Union government tried to cover up the whole incident.

419
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:47,794
The Cold War was underway.

420
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,802
So the Soviet Union didn't want the world to know what had transpired there.

421
00:18:51,802 --> 00:18:55,146
But it is something that couldn't be hushed up for long.

422
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:56,994
Because the radioactive dust,

423
00:18:56,994 --> 00:18:58,705
had reached all the way to Sweden.

424
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,490
Swedish monitoring stations detected that

425
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,626
the levels of radioactivity were unreasonably high.

426
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:07,141
They carried out an analysis of the direction of the wind,

427
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:09,730
and estimated the source of it.

428
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:15,120
This forced the Soviet authorities to put the information about the disaster to the public.

429
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,501
On 28th April 1986,

430
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:20,130
the Soviet Union admitted that a disaster had indeed taken place.

431
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,232
Two days after the actual disaster.

432
00:19:22,232 --> 00:19:24,393
The people living around this power plant,

433
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:27,578
were told about what had happened after quite some time.

434
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:31,613
This is another event for which the Soviet government is blamed.

435
00:19:31,613 --> 00:19:33,914
By 2nd May 1986,

436
00:19:33,914 --> 00:19:38,530
a 30 km radius was set up all around this nuclear power plant,

437
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,314
It was declared an exclusion zone.

438
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,246
This became a restricted area where no one could enter

439
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:46,133
except for scientists and government officials.

440
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:49,190
To contain the radioactive waste,

441
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,069
another structure was built on top of it,

442
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:53,211
known as the Sarcophagus,

443
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:55,338
It was completed by November 1986,

444
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:57,642
a concrete and metal structure

445
00:19:57,642 --> 00:20:00,963
to control the radiation coming off of it.

446
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:03,649
But this structure wasn't built for the long term.

447
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:08,304
About 28 years after it was constructed,
rust and cracks started forming.

448
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:10,113
This is why in 2010,

449
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:12,786
the construction of the new safe confinement began.

450
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:16,248
This new structure was fit atop the existing sarcophagus.

451
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,692
3 billion dollars were spent on building this new structure.

452
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:21,951
It took 9 years to build it.

453
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:24,274
Being completed only in 2019.

454
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:27,105
But since it was built with a plan for the long term,

455
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:31,881
it is said that this can keep the reactor closed off for the next 100 years.

456
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:35,393
In 2018, the United Nations Scientific Community reported that

457
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:40,965
20,000 cases of thyroid cancer were seen in children below the age of 18 years.

458
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:42,750
Who lived through the disaster.

459
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,215
The main reason for this is said to be

460
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:48,505
the radioactive dust settling on the grass

461
00:20:48,505 --> 00:20:51,679
on the pastures where cattle were fed.

462
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,902
After the cows ate the grass,

463
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:58,372
their milk contained a high level of Iodine 131.

464
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:01,199
It gets absorbed in our thyroid gland,

465
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:03,674
leading to thyroid cancer in children.

466
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:06,028
The trees around this area,

467
00:21:06,028 --> 00:21:08,902
had a red ginger-coloured tint to them.

468
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:12,325
This led to the area being called the Red Forest.

469
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:13,780
In terms of the economics of it,

470
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,560
the cost of the disaster to the Soviet Union

471
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,970
$235 billion.

472
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,763
Can you imagine how much money it is?

473
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:23,482
Emergency response, cleaning up,

474
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,263
relocating people, paying the expenses of the survivors,

475
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:29,334
carrying out evacuations and decontamination of the environment

476
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:30,980
they had to bear all expenses.

477
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,144
Politically, it is said to be a major reason

478
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:36,462
for the breakdown of the Soviet Union.

479
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,091
Scientists all around the world started conducting research

480
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:42,682
on preventing such future nuclear disasters.

481
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:44,521
As a direct result of this disaster,

482
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:49,288
the World Association of Nuclear Operators was founded in 1989.

483
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:51,593
The aim of this international organisation was to

484
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:55,657
conduct safety checks of all the nuclear power plants in the world.

485
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:58,973
And to conduct research into how their safety can be further increased.

486
00:21:58,973 --> 00:22:01,255
I already mentioned one of its examples,

487
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:03,994
how the present-day nuclear reactors

488
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:07,570
use water as the Moderator as well as the Coolant.

489
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,916
In order to prevent any positive feedback loop.

490
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,186
Even though there were high levels of radiation in this area,

491
00:22:12,186 --> 00:22:14,666
the remaining parts of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,

492
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,181
continued to be in operation until the year 2000.

493
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:20,637
To meet the power needs of Ukraine.

494
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:24,136
After that, this power station was slated to be dismantled.

495
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:25,745
And the process of doing so continues even now.

496
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,230
It is expected that by 2028,

497
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,919
this process would end.

498
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,450
About 2,400 people work in this plant now.

499
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,961
Either they work as the guards

500
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:37,724
to defend the exclusion zone,

501
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,535
or they are the firefighters, scientists,

502
00:22:39,535 --> 00:22:41,351
technicians or service staff.

503
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:43,975
Because the radiation levels are so high there,

504
00:22:43,975 --> 00:22:47,065
they work only 2 shifts a week.

505
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,970
And they are regularly monitored to check the levels of radiation absorbed by them.

506
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,865
The area around the plant,

507
00:22:53,865 --> 00:22:56,976
in the 30 km exclusion zone,

508
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:59,310
has been completely abandoned by humans.

509
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,634
Before the war began, tourist groups did go to that zone,

510
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:06,449
but more or less, the area has been taken over by nature.

511
00:23:06,449 --> 00:23:09,498
Big animals like wolves, deers, lynx,

512
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:13,517
beavers, eagles, boars, and bears are found in this area.

513
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,624
Some of these animals are even endangered.

514
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:17,758
But they have a thriving population here,

515
00:23:17,758 --> 00:23:19,414
because of the lack of humans.

516
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:22,310
Radiation has indeed affected some animals,

517
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,500
and deformities have been spotted,

518
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,046
but for the most part,

519
00:23:26,046 --> 00:23:29,141
there wasn't a major impact of the radiation on the animals.

520
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:32,806
Friends, this was the story of the World's Worst Nuclear Disaster,

521
00:23:32,806 --> 00:23:34,076
if you liked the video,

522
00:23:34,076 --> 00:23:38,984
you can watch the video on Bhopal Gas Tragedy to understand that in detail.

523
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,951
I have made numerous videos on such historical events,

524
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:43,914
you can click on this playlist to watch them all.

525
00:23:43,914 --> 00:23:45,101
Let's meet in the next video.

526
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:46,243
Thank you very much!
