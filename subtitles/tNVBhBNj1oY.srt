00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:15,114
[SINGING] Looking up at the
moonlight, lost in time.

3
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:20,188
Do you know what it feels
like to leave it all behind?

4
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:25,390
Look what we've been through,
yeah, I'm not over you, no.

5
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,954
Don't see why you couldn't be
real, can't read your mind.

7
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:19,048
[SINGING] Watch our castles
crumble, washing away.

If I get trapped
under, I'ma suffocate.

00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:28,672
All that we've been through,
yeah, I'm not over you, no.

00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:33,606
Broken heart and I couldn't
restart, I had to run away.
