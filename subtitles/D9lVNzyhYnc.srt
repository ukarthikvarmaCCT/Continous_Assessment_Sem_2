00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,290
- [Jimmy] The Bermuda Triangle

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,630
is one of the most
dangerous places on earth.

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,180
Over 100 ships and
planes have gone missing

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,740
with no explanation.

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,270
Me and the boys are going to spend

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,720
24 hours straight in the Bermuda Triangle.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,083
Wish us luck.

8
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:17,333
(upbeat intense music)

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,250
Guys, we're in the ocean.

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,020
I want you all to make a will.

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,430
I want you all to take a camera

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,530
and let us know, if something
were to happen to you,

13
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,180
what would you want to
happen with your money?

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,550
- It's not a will if I don't
have a feather and bloom.

15
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,130
- All right, I'm going to
write my will in blues.

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,223
My last will and testament.

17
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:37,890
I don't own a lot of things,

18
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,950
so I'll probably just
leave my dog to my fam

19
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,870
and everything else to my family.

20
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,858
But my ostrich is a free man.

21
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:46,740
- All right, so my last
will and testament,

22
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,640
I'm going to leave the house,
our cars, our dogs, our cats-

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,473
- To me.

24
00:00:51,473 --> 00:00:53,700
- And all of our money to my wife.

25
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,900
- All right guys, if I die,

26
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,060
mom, just take the car that Jimmy gave me

27
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,180
and my Xbox, keep that.

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,160
- For their wills, they
wanted quills and paper,

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,150
so I got them it.

30
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,983
Oh Hi.

31
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:04,920
- Did you actually get a-

32
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,880
- Here's the paper.

33
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,713
- [Tareq] There you have it.

34
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:08,700
Chris is giving everything to his wife

35
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,140
- [Chris] And a smiley face.

36
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,680
- [Viking] It says, my will,
give my boat to my dad.

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,743
Shelby can have everything,
except my web history.

38
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,380
- We're actually, currently,
in the Bermuda Triangle.

39
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,480
The boys aren't really doing too well.

40
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,610
We're all seasick beyond belief.

41
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,140
Oh, this water's killing me.

42
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,520
Starting now.

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,993
24 hours begins.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,900
Are you guys okay?

45
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,401
- Does any part of me look okay right now?

46
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:38,970
- I'm going to go tell the
captain to take us anywhere

47
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,803
not here.

48
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:41,460
The water's too.

49
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,293
- [Tareq] Bye Chan.

50
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:43,126
- [Chris] Yeah, he's dead.

51
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:44,640
I want you to stand right here

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,153
and just look at this going up and down.

53
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,490
We're not being babies.

54
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,440
It's been requested that we find

55
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,510
a little bit calmer waters.

56
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,350
- Give me 10 minutes.

57
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,825
It's going to be like a swimming pool.

58
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,290
(upbeat music)

59
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,850
- We came to a little bit calmer waters.

60
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,290
As you can see the waves aren't as big.

61
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,280
So, are you fine?

62
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,113
- I'm doing better.

63
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:04,380
- We're probably going
to go back out there.

64
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,180
- That's not good. I threw up 11 times.

65
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,440
Hey Jimmy, can I get the in the water?

66
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,660
- We're literally in the Bermuda Triangle.

67
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,120
Chris, this is the Bermuda Triangle

68
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,999
- [Viking] He's going in.

69
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,420
- [Jimmy] Hole in one.

70
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,163
- [Viking] Why not?

71
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:18,900
- What could possibly go wrong?

72
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,310
- I'm about to jump off a yacht.

73
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,072
I love you Jimmy. If I don't make it.

74
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:24,655
(upbeat music)

75
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,113
- [Tareq] We got him.

76
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,278
- [Jimmy] Dude, that's crazy!

77
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:30,861
(upbeat music)

78
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,368
- [Tareq] Marcus, you going?

79
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:36,201
- Bruh.

80
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:37,034
(laughing)

81
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:37,867
No.

82
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:38,700
- All right, Marc.

83
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,533
- All right Marc, go.

84
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,670
- How's the water feel dude?

85
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,670
- Feels pretty good.

86
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:46,454
(laughing)

87
00:02:48,748 --> 00:02:49,753
- Are you ready to have fun dude?

88
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,064
(upbeat music)

89
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:53,503
(yelling)

90
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:56,086
(upbeat music)

91
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,630
Wait guys.

92
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,620
- [Tareq] Dude, where's Chandler?

93
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,390
- I swear he was there the whole time.

94
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,500
- [Tareq] Yo, he lost Chandler.

95
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,760
- I'm going to go find him.

96
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,230
- I'm out.

97
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,280
slowly.

98
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,113
- [Viking] We got him!

99
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:10,300
- [Chris] I got him by the toe!

100
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,300
- [Tareq] Bring Chandler over here.

101
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,203
- Chandler, buddy.

102
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:15,279
- [Tareq] Chandler. Are you okay?

103
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,612
- [Jimmy] Are you okay?

104
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:17,596
- Yeah.

105
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:21,145
- All right guys, Last one
to fall off win's $2,000.

106
00:03:21,145 --> 00:03:22,275
- [Tareq] Oh!

107
00:03:22,275 --> 00:03:24,890
(yelling)

108
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,757
(laughing)

109
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:28,751
(yelling)

110
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,001
(laughing)

111
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:38,045
- I'm still on!

112
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:39,261
- Last off.

113
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,138
- [Tareq] It's off.

114
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:40,971
- [Jimmy] Chandler won!

115
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,137
(cheering)

116
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:44,720
(upbeat music)

117
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,200
We are doing a cool trick competition,

118
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,300
whoever jumps off the yacht
with the coolest trick,

119
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,230
wins two grand.

120
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,130
Chandler.

121
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,151
Go for it.

122
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,847
- [All Together] Chandler!

123
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:57,077
- [Jimmy] Okay. All alright.

124
00:03:57,077 --> 00:03:59,520
Front flip! All right, all right.

125
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,353
- [Tareq] All right Marc.

126
00:04:00,353 --> 00:04:01,186
- Woo!

127
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:08,443
- [Tareq] Oh my God, that looked painful.

128
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:10,050
(upbeat music)

129
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,040
- [Jimmy] Another front flip!

130
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,360
Now that everyone is dried off,

131
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,640
we will crown the winners
of the trick competition.

132
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,010
Marcus, you just did a pencil dive.

133
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,843
- I deserve to win.

134
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:18,873
That was the-

135
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:19,950
(buzzer buzzing)

136
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,030
- You just did a cannon.

137
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,130
- No, I belly flopped.

138
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,820
- You better not. I did
the best front flip.

139
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,750
- And so did Chris.

140
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,221
- No, his was worse and I went first.

141
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:30,120
I went first!

142
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,397
- We all know that you never win.

143
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,288
- Oh?

144
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:35,121
- What was your-

145
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:35,954
- I did-

146
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:36,789
- Whoa.

147
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:37,622
(buzzer buzzing)

148
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:39,660
- [Chris] I wish I'd had pushed you in!

149
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,850
- We have to keep Chandler's brand alive.

150
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,623
We have to. It's for-

151
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:45,308
- I knew it!

152
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:46,141
(buzzer buzzing)

153
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:46,974
- I did it.

154
00:04:46,974 --> 00:04:47,807
- Chandler's the winner.

155
00:04:47,807 --> 00:04:48,640
(cheering)

156
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,473
All right. All right.

157
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:50,306
- Oh my.

158
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:51,417
(laughing)

159
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,667
- All right, come on,
children, let's go eat.

160
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,573
- [Tareq] So what happened?

161
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:58,950
- The big time lives
camera fell into the water.

162
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,300
So we're going to try and rescue it.

163
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,133
- [Tareq] Please rescue it.

164
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,160
- We're trying.

165
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,103
- [Tareq] Shine a light on
Chris, shine a light on Chris.

166
00:05:06,568 --> 00:05:07,581
Do you see anything?

167
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:09,200
Don't lose Viking. Don't lose Viking.

168
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,950
(sad music)

169
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,530
- How do you liking the
Bermuda Triangle so far?

170
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,290
- It's pretty dangerous to cameras.

171
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,910
- The only thing that's
gotten hurt so far,

172
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,490
in the Bermuda Triangle, is
literally our $7,000 camera.

173
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,960
- I stubbed my toe.

174
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,520
- Honestly, I'm kind of enjoying it.

175
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,750
Maybe it's 'cause we're on a yacht

176
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,830
but it doesn't seem that bad.

177
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,510
- The reason why all those sailors

178
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,640
and Amelia Earhart all went missing,

179
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,450
'cause it's so nice here.

180
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,410
Why would you leave?

181
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,360
- Maybe the reason why
this place is so dangerous

182
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,530
is because they don't have trees.

184
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,620
We're almost at 20 million.

185
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,510
Now that all of you guys are fed,

186
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,070
it's time for the next challenge.

187
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,290
As you know, things in
the Bermuda Triangle

188
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,400
typically go missing.

189
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,750
So let's play hide and seek.

190
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,583
- You should count the 10,000,

191
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,460
'cause you've already done it.

192
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,260
- [Jimmy] I'm going to go count to 500.

193
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,357
You guys hide. whoever
I find last gets $2,000.

194
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:53,190
- Ooh. Okay.

195
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,350
- So I'm in my room and I'm
going to begin counting.

196
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,650
One, two, three, four.

197
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,090
- [Tareq] Oh my God, can you fit?

198
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,245
- There's no way I'm fitting.

199
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:02,430
- [Tareq] No dude. You can, you can.

200
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,346
- There's no way I'm fitting.

201
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:04,179
- [Tareq] You have to believe in-

202
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:05,012
- Here, hold this.

203
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:05,845
I can't get out and it hurts

204
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,490
I know you can't see, but
I'm on the top of the boat.

205
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,570
He'll never see me.

206
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,103
- 40, 41, 42.

207
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,490
- Holy crap, it's hot in here.

208
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,677
As you can see, I'm in like a,

209
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:21,510
I'm underneath something.

210
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,604
- 301, 302, 303.

211
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:28,303
- [Viking] And I'm going
to try and hide over here.

212
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:30,886
(upbeat music)

213
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:34,320
They'll never notice me right here.

214
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,238
- 500. Let's do this.

215
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:38,372
Someone has to be here.

216
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:40,517
I hear movement.

217
00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:42,510
I hope no one's hiding in the water.

218
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,713
We'll keep exploring.

219
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,530
I see you!

220
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,180
- [Chris] I couldn't find anywhere else.

221
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,830
All of my spots didn't work.

222
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,060
I want another try.

223
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,710
- Let's check the rooms.

224
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,830
This door's cracked and I
bet you they left it cracked,

225
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,886
So I wouldn't think someones in here.

226
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,880
Making sure I'm checking
every nook and cranny.

227
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,713
- Cranny!

228
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,140
(laughing)

229
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,970
The look on your face was priceless.

230
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,470
- I thought I had someone.

231
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,260
- [Chris] You said I could
not mess with other people.

232
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,690
You didn't say I could not sword you.

233
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,990
Oh, you got to be quicker.

234
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,330
- I think there's someone in here.

235
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:19,481
Hey.

236
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,370
- No!

237
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,780
- We know someone's in the closet.

238
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,613
How we mess with them?

239
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:25,412
- We need Febreze and just
start spraying Febreze.

240
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,424
I know where some is.

241
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:30,273
- We're going to Febreze bomb
whoever's in the bathroom.

242
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,670
- [Chris] Did you check in here?

243
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,770
- [Jimmy] Yep, we did.

244
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,470
- [Jimmy] Wait. I can't see anyone.

245
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,760
- [Chris] He's known you've been in there

246
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,230
from the beginning.

247
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,070
- Can I come out now?

248
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,903
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

249
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:46,260
Chandler won. We haven't found him yet.

250
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,840
- [Tareq] Chandler is the
only one we haven't found yet.

251
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,886
- I know where he is.

252
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,930
(upbeat music)

253
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,310
- Did they forget about me?

254
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,750
Probably.

255
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,770
I'm going to get the freak out of here,

256
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,090
I don't care anymore.

257
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,390
Couldn't breathe in there.

258
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:02,070
- [Jimmy] Hey, there you are.

259
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,873
Really, all I had to do was come up here

260
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:07,123
(cheering)

261
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,890
- Guys, I just heard something.

262
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,820
I got to find somebody who-

263
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,487
what the freak was that?

264
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:15,363
Hello? Jake, Jake, Jake.

265
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,993
What?

266
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,793
Marcus? Oh no.

267
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,790
- We're hiding from Chandler.

268
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,197
We woke him up and then hid.

269
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:27,420
- There's literally no one in here.

270
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,383
Where is everyone?

271
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,659
- We are now in his room.

272
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,263
- Guys? This isn't funny.

273
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,733
Yo, this is too, I'm not
ever doing this again.

274
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Just going to go back to my room, since.

275
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,853
What the heck?

276
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,241
- [Jimmy] Surprise!

277
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:56,208
- [All Together] Surprise!

278
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,758
Happy birthday! Yay!

279
00:08:57,758 --> 00:09:00,210
(clapping)

280
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,043
- [Chris] Hey buddy.

281
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:02,000
- You guys are sharing this room.

282
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,480
- Oh yeah, aren't you glad you found us?

283
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,560
- I'm very glad, yes.

284
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,570
'Cause I was upstairs and I saw someone

285
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,580
but I think it was a crew member

286
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,413
and I was in my underwear

287
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:10,770
(laughing)

288
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,060
- [Jimmy] While the seasickness,

289
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,500
the camera falling in the ocean

290
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,570
and Chandler winning
three challenges in a row,

291
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,250
were all bizarre occurrences,

292
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,800
we still weren't convinced
it was the Bermuda Triangle.

293
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,870
But later that night, we
managed to get some footage

294
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,550
of some disturbing stuff.

295
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,720
- Hey Chandler.

296
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,120
Chandler, did you hear that?

297
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,470
I think I heard something.

298
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,090
That's okay.

299
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,110
Got my trusty sword.

300
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,910
I'm going to sleep here with my sword.

301
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,410
- [Tareq] Conner, can you see?

302
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,243
- [Conner] No.

303
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:36,690
- [Tareq] Open the door,
just go after them.

304
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,523
- [Conner] Okay.

305
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,200
- [Chris] Ah, a ghost!

306
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,373
Why are you in here?

307
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,220
Call off your, whatever this is.

308
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,294
- [Conner] Ow dude. You're
using the sheet that doesn't-

309
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:48,890
(drumming)

310
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,390
- [Tareq] Do you guys want
to join in on our raid?

311
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,703
- [Chris] Yeah, sure. I'll raid.

312
00:09:57,444 --> 00:09:58,735
It's a ghost, ah!

313
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:00,902
- Conny, that was all- oh!

314
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:06,943
- [Conner] Ooh, it's a ghost.

315
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:11,468
(laughing)

316
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,633
- Reveal yourself!

317
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:23,620
Oh, it was Conner.

318
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,800
- [Tareq] Yeah, you just tackled his head.

319
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,180
Hey guys, good night.

320
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,770
All right. Hey guys.

321
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,630
Marcus, good night.

322
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,463
Okay.

323
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:32,387
- That's not my bedroom.

324
00:10:32,387 --> 00:10:33,220
- [Tareq] Oh, that's not your bedroom?

325
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,144
- [Viking] Excuse me. Excuse me.

326
00:10:35,144 --> 00:10:35,977
This is my bed room.

327
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:36,810
- [Tareq] That's your bedroom?

328
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,268
- Yep. All right, well, good night.

329
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:40,560
(upbeat music)

330
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,720
- All right, Jake (indistinct),
it's currently 7:00 AM.

331
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,030
Chris, did we survive
the Bermuda Triangle?

332
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,153
- [Chris] I barely survived last night.

333
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:50,220
- It's 'cause you stayed up
all night playing video games.

334
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,770
Blade, why don't you have pants on?

335
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,500
- I was woken, in my awoken sleep.

336
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,411
- Wrapping a towel around your
waist is easier than pants?

337
00:10:58,411 --> 00:10:59,370
- [Chris] It's a blanket, not a towel.

338
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,990
- I was told I was needed.

339
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,440
- Just going to go over here.

340
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:08,580
(upbeat music)

341
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,635
- We're heading back. It's a little wavy.

342
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:12,662
- I'm going to throw up.

343
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:14,111
- I feel like I'm going to throw up.

344
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,180
You want me to throw up on camera?

345
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,680
- [Tareq] Not again.

346
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,513
- We made it.

347
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:19,890
- Never going on a yacht again,
not that I can afford it.

348
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,723
- I got sick a lot.

349
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:21,690
- I almost threw up.

350
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,610
- It turns out the only thing dangerous

351
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,710
about the Bermuda Triangle
is motion sickness

352
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,440
and terrible tripods.

353
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,440
- [Man Singing] Mr. Beast 6,000. Oh, oh.

354
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,030
Mr. Beast 6,000, yeah, you know his name.

355
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,826
He changed it once or twice,
but I think it's here to stay.

356
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:40,728
(explosion exploding)
