iphone 10. oh there it is there it is

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,960
sometimes it's hard to break away from

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,119
that ecosystem what is it about this

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,200
ecosystem you're talking about more

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
specifically just imessage i guess i've

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,119
heard this argument i truly don't

33
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,799
understand it what is it is it is this a

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,520
green bubble a green bubble blue bubble

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,280
type of prejudice going on here it's a

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,720
green bubble blue bubble war what do you

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,479
think about face id though it works for

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,320
me though it's really iffy with

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,320
sunglasses sometimes right there's no

40
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,560
reamer rising or reason to rhyme for it

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
it's just no reamer rising rising

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,759
reasoning

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,000
right right i hear austin just cracking

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
up everyone over there is giggling and

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,320
covering their mouths

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,640

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,159

why so i'm on the pixel 2 xl my galaxy

81
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,920
s8 something i have installed on it is

82
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,599
making the battery drain really fast i

83
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,280
haven't had the time to deal with it are

84
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,720
you trying to say you preferred it is

85
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,440

86
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,720
phones with me i can give you the

87
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,800
reasons for all of them this one i'm on

88
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,519
because i popped the sim out of the mate

89
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,080
10 pro there was some software that

90
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,680
wasn't installed on it i needed to use

91
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,519
so i put my sim in here you sound like

92
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,519
the most reluctant pixel user i've ever

93
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,280
heard in my life

94
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,519
it's okay oh so you're not a big fan of

95
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,040
it yeah

96
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,760
um

97
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,270
round roblox

98
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,000
[Applause]

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,519
it's good it's really good i love the

100
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,760
i haven't used a phone for longer than a

101
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,400
month at a time in over half a year part

102
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,879
of my deal is i switched the eight i was

103
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,159
using the a plus the pixel 2 not the xl

104
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,799
this was the last one i was on before i

105
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,720
switched to the razer phone which i

106
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,879
frankly didn't like that much so the sim

107
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,720
went back in this one if you could put

108
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,480
any one of them in your pocket not not

109
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,319
the most convenient at that moment which

110
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,599
one would it be i'm really happy with

111
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,159
this one okay so what is this one

112
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,400
sort of

113
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,959
look at these hands i can't handle this

114
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,040
much phone

115
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,439
so really what i want is the s8 back but

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,280
with not my batteries how about this in

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
the form factor of just the pixels yeah

118
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,799
that'd be fine yeah i like this watch

119
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,970
better than i like my phone

120
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,040
