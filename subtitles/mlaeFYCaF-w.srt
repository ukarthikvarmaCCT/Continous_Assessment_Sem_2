19
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:13,815

00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:28,335
For now friends, the box of my iPhone ...

26
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:31,395
...has some Arabic written on it because I bought it from Dubai.

27
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:33,605
if talk about the price..its really great!!!

28
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:34,805
Here in Dubai the cost of 256 GB is ....

29
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:37,525
Indian Rupees 83,000 ( US$ 1303)

30
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:39,455
if you need iPhone X with 64GB

31
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:41,945
then it will be Indian Rupees 70,000 (US$ 1099)

32
00:01:41,945 --> 00:01:44,965
IPhoneX prices are  just astronomical in India... In India you will get for....

33
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:46,485
Indian Rupees 102,000 (US$1602)

34
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:49,265
You can buy a nice second hand Alto Car in this amount.

35
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:52,185
But what can you do...Apple like to cheat people like this in India.

36
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:54,315
Lets remove the wrap from the box.

37
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,995
You can see the box from all around.

38
00:01:56,995 --> 00:02:00,025
When I open the lid, You can see

39
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:01,775
a paper that says " Designed by Apple..

40
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:03,515
..in California"

41
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:06,375
You see there is a Hello Guide that shows

42
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,025
Some new gestures of this iPhone X.

43
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:11,995

44
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:15,025

45
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:18,015
Here you see iPhone X..that looks very compact.

46
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:20,795
We will talk about it later.

47
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:23,545
Apple made a lot of profit on this phone by fooling people...

48
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:26,535
Here you have a old style.. ...

49
00:02:26,535 --> 00:02:29,315

On the back we have the converters. You can use it to...

52
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:37,045
...connect your traditional ear phones.

53
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:40,075
Here you see the Apple's Lightening cable..that is usually of very poor quality..

54
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:42,425
It breaks easily....

55
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:45,535
The main thing here I have in my hand is iPhone X...

56
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:48,445
Lets remove the plastic wrap from the screen...

57
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:49,985

58
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:52,525
I will give you the physical overview of the phone in the mean time.

This button on the side is not a Power Button,

67
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:13,975

88
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:06,135

89
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,475

You can use your face

100
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:35,955
as a password.

101
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:38,955
you do not get Finger print scanner in this phone...

102
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:41,725
Apple claims that Facial ID is very secure and safe.

103
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:44,435

from Swipe I remembered that there is

108
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,425
NO HOME button in this phone. Most of the commands are based on gestures...

109
00:04:57,425 --> 00:04:59,475
if you want to come out of any app..to go to back to home screen....

110
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:01,075

111

Then you have to swipe from top right

118
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:17,945
if you do it from any where else..middle or left..then

119

from there you can turn on your camera, flash light(Torch),

121
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:24,825
