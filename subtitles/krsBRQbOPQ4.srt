1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:04,170
This is a $250 million private
island.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,141
Literally, anything you could ever
want is on this island.

3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,709
And I'm going to show you
the difference

4
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:13,880
between this and a $150
million luxury island,

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,052
a massive $45 million island,
a $5 million frozen island

6
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:22,188
all the way down to the cheapest
private island in the world.

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,291
That thing I'm starting to realize
might not all fit on it.

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,228
First step on my brand new island.

9
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,462
Here's your dollar.

10
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:30,130
Thank you, sir.

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,065
- Thank you for selling it to me.
- It's yours now, buddy.

12
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,466
Let's check out
what I just bought.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,701
My first impressions

14
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,336
is that it's a lot smaller than I thought.

15
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,337
When you pay a dollar,

16
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,839
you get a random pile of bricks,
an old toilet.

17
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,807
I found the restroom.

18
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,776
And a bunch of random wooden poles.

19
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,677
There's more poles than
square feet on this thing.

20
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,879
They're actually called pylons.

21
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,280
Let's pile onto that boat and leave.

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,750
And as you can see, there's nothing
here, so I'm going to blow it up.

23
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:55,755
But later in this video,
we're going to a $150 million island

24
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,192
and also a quarter
billion dollar super island.

25
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,962
But first, we're going to head over
to the $1 million dollar island called

26
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:03,696
Monkey Island.

27
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,632
Yes, you heard me right.

28
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:09,135
This island is literally swarmed
with hundreds of monkeys.

29
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,171
I can see why it's called
Monkey Island.

30
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,539
- What's this monkey?
- It's Odie.

31
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,307
Odie took my orange.

32
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,041
Okay.

33
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,376
Monkey see food, monkey take.

34
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,644
All the monkeys on this island

35
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:19,746
have a strategy
for interacting with people.

36
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,181
They gaslight you into thinking

37
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,283
that you're friends,
and then they steal your food.

38
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,384
You can have it.
You can have it.

39
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,718
I love this monkey.

40
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,320
There's a monkey on the boat.

41
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,588
And if you're wondering
where are you

42
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,590
and your friends are going to sleep
on this island,

43
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,561
Suspended above the water are six
luxury cabanas, which house

44
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,329
both humans and monkeys.

45
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,264
The monkey's grabbing the GoPro, Jimmy.

46
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,266
Sir, we need this for filming.

47
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,602
I just need to borrow this.

48
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,204
Thank you. Okay.

49
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,872
I got my camera back.
You want... Oops.

50
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,341
He wants your hat.

51
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,043
Okay, you can have that, sir.

52
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,377
By the end of this,
I'm going to be naked.

53
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,645
The monkeys are stealing everything.

54
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,381
And the monkeys are not even
the coolest part of this island.

55
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,318
See, this island isn't
even an island at all.

56
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,821
It's actually the top of a massive
underwater plant network

57
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,090
that emerged from the sand and water

58
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,026
to create this illusion of an island
that we see today.

59
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:10,163
Is this a milion dollar island
or a million dollar bush?

60
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,931
- Because there's no land.
- What do you think?

61
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,299
I don't know.

62
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,801
I think an island
is what you make of it.

63
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,805
And on the other side of the island,
there's even a private relaxation area

64
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,440
And a beachfront massage parlor.

65
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,107
Nolan!

66
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,475
I'm trying not to fall in the water.

67
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,744
I'm about to get a massage
with a monkey.

68
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:25,612
That's really cool.

69
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,514
Notice how all the water
around you is freezing.

70
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,214
What?

71
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,048
That took a lot of effort.

72
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,950
And we put that much effort in
to convey

73
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,052
that the $5 million Island
is very cool.

74
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:36,589
And where we're going next,
most of the year looks like this,

75
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,858
but it's going to look like this.

76
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:39,459
No joke.

77
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,695
This island is so cold right now
that the lake surrounding it

78
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,698
is actually frozen solid,
which means to get there,

79
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,734
we're going to be using
an interesting vehicule.

80
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:48,868
We're literally hovering.

81
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:49,235
Yeah.

82
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,971
Apparently snowmobiles would have
been too basic for this island.

83
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,873
It just had to be hovercrafts.

84
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,908
This is awesome.

85
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,276
Talking about arriving in fashion.

86
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,877
And it only took about 30 seconds

87
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,580
being outside the hovercraft
for the gang to be frozen solid.

88
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,916
- How cold is it?
- It's zero degrees celsius.

89
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:03,683
It's pretty cold, man

90
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,084
He’s more like a 70 guy.

91
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,653
So, they hurried over

92
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,722
to these futuristic
self-heating huts to stay warm.

93
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,124
Oh, this is so small.

94
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,326
Wait, there's no
room for you in here.

95
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,160
We're gonna have to cuddle then.

96
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,230
And these huts are able to stay here
completely year round

97
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,300
because they're able to both float
on warm, peaceful lake water.

98
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,569
But they also do
just fine in the dead of winter.

99
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,770
But at least in the winter,

100
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,672
you get a great view
of the northern lights.

101
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,074
For $5 million, you basically
get a winter wonderland.

102
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,509
And while staying on this island,

103
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,011
you're given unlimited
five star food.

104
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,546
I think he thinks we speak Finnish.

105
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:40,086
And even though this island comes
with a luxury cabin to stay in.

106
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,456
Oh, this is beautiful.

107
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,524
Fine, I'll take it.

108
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,491
Jimmy, buy it for me.

109
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,561
The gang ended up spending
most of their time on the frozen lake

110
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,264
where they were able to ride
an actual dog sled.

111
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,099
He took your glove.

112
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,701
Oh my Gosh!

113
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,969
This is the best island.

114
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,570
I don't know how
any island is going to beat this.

115
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,272
Maybe one where I could feel my hands.

116
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,809
And Karl's hands are in luck
because this next island is not only warm

117
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,945
but more expensive
than all of the other islands combined.

118
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,782
This island is tiny,
but arguably one of the most

119
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,551
luxurious ones out there.

120
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,086
Okay, let's go check the house.

121
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,455
Feast!

122
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,357
We're stoked to have you
as our guest.

123
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,659
We hope you have a blast.
Just don't break anything.

124
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,361
Yo, we should try to break one thing.

125
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,964
Oh, nice bathroom.

126
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:29,269
Usually rich people like showers that
can fit like 30 to 1000 people in them.

127
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,170
This time,
they chose a reasonable shower.

128
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,972
When you pay $16 million

129
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,808
in addition to a shower,
that's the size of the $1 island,

130
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,011
the private island comes
with this helicopter

131
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,113
that's apparently too
big for this island.

132
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,014
We have jet skis.

133
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,549
We have a submarine.
Another submarine to the right.

134
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,451
We have a shark submarine
over there.

135
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,320
There's almost a submarine
for each of us.

136
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,955
Boys, do whatever you want.
Have fun. You're out. You

137
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,456
Yeah! Yeah!

138
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:52,825
I’m going really fast.

139
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,996
I love private islands.

140
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,798
Karl, if you had one wish,
what would it be?

141
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,366
To get off of this thing!

142
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,901
Yeah!

143
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,406
We're underwater!

144
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,674
I am a fish now.

145
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,377
After Ludwig and Karl kissed
the sea at 500 miles per hour,

146
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,581
we went back to shore
to take a little breather.

147
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,316
Yeah.

148
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,384
Ludwig's
going to jump out of a helicopter.

149
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,185
He really is.

150
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,020
No, wait, I'm not...
Wait, what?

151
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,657
Any last words?

152
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,893
I love you, Mom.
I'm sorry.

153
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:27,727
This helicopter

154
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,829
is taking the boys
up into the air

155
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,832
and letting them jump and
freefall into the ocean.

156
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,467
Oh, my God.

157
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,336
This is crazy.
We shouldn't be doing this.

158
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,237
This is only a $16 million island,

159
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,939
and we're jumping out of a helicopter.

160
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,743
He's about to jump.

161
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,012
Oh my Gosh!

162
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,148
Oh wait! They jump!

163
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,851
There he goes.

164
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,157
Whoever said money doesn't buy
happiness,

165
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,661
doesn't own that private island,
because I'm pretty happy.

166
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,498
And now the $45 million island,

167
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,835
this island is so big,
you can't even fit it all in frame.

168
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,637
Oh, hey, I didn't realize
they were waiting on us.

169
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,238
- Hi!
- Hi!

170
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,540
I always feel uncomfortable
when I pull up to places

171
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,976
and people are just standing
potentially for hours waiting on me.

172
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,177
Hello!

173
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,979
We have some blueberry smoothies
here.

174
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:20,880
Is it alcoholic?

175
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,848
No, it's not.

176
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:22,849
He's not 21

177
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,852
now we'll take you guys up
and we'll show you around Royal Island

178
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:26,552
a little bit.

179
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,020
Let's see what
$45 million gets us.

180
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,489
It's a long path.

181
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,290
The path is longer than
the last island.

182
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,059
For $45 million,

183
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,461
this island comes with
a mansion and its own

184
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,663
beachside bar and private chef.

185
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,899
- Can I give it a flip?
- Sure.

186
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,134
That's not too bad.

187
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,236
And outside of the
mansion is a hot tub

188
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,638
overlooking the
cove where the jet skis are

189
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:49,008
and of course, a pool
with the best view I've ever seen.

190
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,210
Does this look as cool on camera
as it does in real life?

191
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,579
And if for some reason, you
don't want to stay in the mansion,

192
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,916
there's five luxury beachside cabanas
you can pick from.

193
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,151
Jimmy, may I?

194
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,085
You may.

195
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:00,686
May I?

196
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,254
You may.

197
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,488
I have class.

198
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,558
But even after messing around
with all of the amenities.

199
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,460
Why are we playing ping pong
when we have an entire island?

200
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,463
It's important to note that that's
not what makes this island special.

201
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,931
All the way at the other end of

202
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,468
the island are century-old ruins
that we are yet to explore.

203
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,369
Dibs on driving.

204
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,136
Oh, no.

205
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,271
All right, ready?

206
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,338
Yeah.

207
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,007
We're going to go off
roading a little bit

208
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,175
and head to the back
of the island now.

209
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,709
How does Karl
always end up driving?

210
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,044
- Because I'm awesome.
- Big bump!

211
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,547
Dude, this is like a safari.

212
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,449
Yeah, you're going four times
the speed limit.

213
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,350
 I mean, I don't know if
there's cops that will stop you,

214
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,118
but I'm just letting you know.

215
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,753
Is there a jail on this island?

216
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,454
No Jail.

217
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,121
Oh there's no jail?

218
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,490
And when we finally ran out of road
to drive on,

219
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,025
we started to make our way through

220
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,726
what used to be a village of people

221
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,962
on this island,
over a hundred years ago.

222
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,497
- This used to be a bar?
- Yes

223
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,366
You want to walk under this
100-year-old giant thousand-pound slab?

224
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,402
Sure, surely it won't fall
on top of me.

225
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,904
Dude, if today was the day that it'd fell,
you couldn't even be mad.

226
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,139
Nolan, come over here before you die.

227
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,543
And just past the ruins is easily
the best view on the entire island.

228
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,513
Yeah, it gets better.

229
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,948
We were driving for so long.

230
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,950
I forgot we were on an island.

231
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,053
The island starts over there, comes
all the way around,

232
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,387
wraps all the way around here.

233
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,890
Goes down that coastline
all the way up over there.

234
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:11,791
I'll be honest, I wouldn't

235
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,094
pay $45 million for a big jungle
with some ancient ruins.

236
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,362
But I'm sure some rich guy will.

237
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:20,166
This next island is arguably
the second most expensive island

238
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,334
that money can buy.

239
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,971
This is the $150 million island.

240
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,673
It comes with eight
luxurious mega mansions.

241
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,741
And the best part is

242
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:32,478
it is completely powered
by solar panels and wind turbines.

243
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:36,015
It's home to some of the most
exotic animals I've ever seen,

244
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,851
and took over four decades to build.

245
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,821
This island will literally blow your mind.

246
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,190
When I think of a private island,
this is what I think of.

247
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,259
That's good,
because this is a private island.

248
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:46,726
All right.

249
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:50,196
And apparently the first thing you
need to do here is wash your hands.

250
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,865
Make sure you don't taint the
island with your outside world germs.

251
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,233
I've already
washed my germs.

252
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,035
Does everyone who come here
gets a coconut?

253
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,703
I mean, they're not running low.

254
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:58,471
True.

255
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,173
I don't know if it's
because this place is so fancy.

256
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,376
Or maybe they just
heard about Karl's driving,

257
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,310
Yeah!

258
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,113
But each of us ended up
with our own personal driver.

259
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,782
I have a feeling this is going to be
a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

260
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,184
- Unless you come back.
- That might be out of my price range.

261
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,388
And even though this island costs
$150 million,

262
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,290
you can actually rent it yourself,

263
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,360
for the extremely low price
of 140 grand per day.

264
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,162
I didn't even realize
we just went up a mountain.

265
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,665
I've heard this is the most
luxurious private island in the world.

266
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,332
It is.

267
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,568
- The view is insane.
- This is the great house.

268
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,835
But before we were able

269
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:34,340
to explore the great house, my dumb
friends got distracted by a turtle.

270
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,408
There's a turtle?

271
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,309
Get in there.

272
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,244
Yeah.

273
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,246
All right, you guys
go to the rest of the island.

274
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,316
This island is so extra
that for every one person

275
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,886
in your party, they have ten staff
members waiting on your every need.

276
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,322
There's a bunch of people over there
like here's drinks, here's food.

277
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,057
What do you want to do
over the next few days?

278
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,224
And we're just like "turtle".

279
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,193
And of course,

280
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,363
Nolan, of all my friends
wanted to take advantage of this.

281
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,831
Yes! Yeah!

282
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,567
What's everyone up to over here?

283
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,368
We're playing pool.

284
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,569
With 10 people?

285
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:04,403
They're my hype crew.

286
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,172
You don't have to hang out
with him to make him feel good.

287
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,574
I will be sad
if you don't sit down and relax.

288
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,210
If you need attention,
don't make them stand there.

289
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,012
It's only been an hour,
but I'll say it.

290
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,347
This is the best island so far.

291
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,481
On top of all of that,

292
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,551
the island has a house
with a driving range on the roof

293
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,387
where you can literally hit
golf balls into the ocean.

294
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,255
Because these are made of fish food.

295
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,128
You should probably hit it
further so you don't hit someone.

296
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,064
Look at all those flamingos.
There's so much I can't process it.

297
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,933
Flamingos in the sky.

298
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,101
They are everywhere.

299
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,503
They don't love us
unless we give them food.

300
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,106
Come here, my brethren.

301
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,242
But flamingos aren't the only
exotic animals on this island.

302
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,711
- Bro.
- That's a dinosaur.

303
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,813
This is so cool.

304
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,781
And believe it or not,

305
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,318
this turtle could theoretically
live over 200 years.

306
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,353
Mr. Tortoise, my name is Jimmy.

307
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,389
If my descendants, descendants,
descendants come here.

308
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,690
Tell them I was awesome.

309
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,424
And afterwards,

310
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,993
we got swarmed by a bunch of lemurs
that live on this island over here.

311
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,827
Get over here!

312
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,729
Jimmy, I don't know if you noticed
that there's two lemurs on your head.

313
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,997
Yeah, I know.
I'm trying not to move...

314
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,832
- I'll put food on there.
- Please don't.

315
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,935
And if you're wondering where
all these exotic animals came from,

316
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,839
most of them, sadly, are endangered
species and are all on this island

317
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,774
because the owner,

318
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,777
Richard Branson, brought all of them
here to help prevent them

319
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:18,711
from going extinct.

320
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,646
But the most endangered
animal on the island

321
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,548
were the mermaids
that serve you sushi.

322
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,549
Yeah!

323
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,351
Mermaids and sushi.

324
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,719
This is luxury.

325
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,520
Mermaids!

326
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,455
- Do you guys want sushi?
- I wouldn't say no.

327
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:30,489
Is that cannibalism?

328
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,257
Yes.

329
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,259
It's like a family reunion.
Get over here.

330
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,161
There's honestly
so much on this island.

331
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,529
We can't even film it all.

332
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,664
We play tennis, we play basketball.

333
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,900
We explore yet another mansion.

334
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,535
I did my first cold plunge.

335
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,402
You get the idea.

336
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,837
There's
so much to do on this island.

337
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,639
It's actually overwhelming.

338
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,873
This one's actually pretty intense.

339
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,408
I'm like actually scared.

340
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,277
- You know what else is intense?
- What?

341
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,212
The final island.
I'll see you there.

342
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:54,980
Why are we still here?

343
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,018
And on the way to the $250
million Island,

344
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:02,755
we stopped in shark infested waters
because I have to pay for this video.

345
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,490
And now
that I'm surrounded by sharks

346
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,793
and what
feels like my worst nightmare,

347
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,195
I'm going to tell you guys,
about Stumble Guys.

348
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,129
Bro, they're so close.

349
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:10,730
Oh, my gosh.

350
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,599
And the worst part is I'm not
coming out until I'm done with this ad

351
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,268
Stumble Guys is a free-to-play
mobile player game

352
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,604
where 32 people compete
for the crown.

353
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,673
You have to be an absolute maniac
to do this.

354
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,708
Not even Stumble Guys
could pay me to do this.

355
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,376
Why are you all here, sharks?

356
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:26,912
They're so close,
they're so close.

357
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,047
And for their new season

358
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,349
they went all out with the new
MrBeast skins,

359
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,584
animations and emotes.

360
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,486
Okay, square head, have it...

361
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:34,553
Bro, this is nuts.

362
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,555
I want to make sure
there's enough sharks for Jimmy.

363
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,357
They also added a brand new level,

364
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,060
but you have to follow a pattern
as long as possible to stay alive.

365
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,162
And the longer you live,
the harder it gets.

366
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,497
Is a shark hitting me?

367
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,732
I think the sharks are hitting the cage.
It's rocking!

368
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:47,833
Oh, this is scary.

369
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,400
Not only that,

370
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,204
I also just released my new toolkit
so you can build your own MrBeast level.

371
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,839
This is one of their best seasons ever.

372
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,042
You need to try my new MrBeast level,
plus build your own.

373
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,044
And I want
to see what you guys come up with.

374
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,781
The sharks keep hitting the cage.
So I'm going to get out of here.

375
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,549
Make sure to download
Stumble Guys for free

376
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,151
so I don't have to go back
in the shark cage.

377
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,519
You're alive.

378
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,420
Let's go do more things that have
nothing to do with sharks.

379
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:08,821
Please.

380
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:12,258
And now that I've paid off the debt
I've incurred from this video,

381
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,095
let's visit the $250 million island.

382
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:20,299
This is a $250 million
private island.

383
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,336
This extraordinary island
has an entire amusement park

384
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,772
with over a dozen waterslides.

385
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,843
It also has its own hot air balloon
and just about every activity

386
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,644
you could imagine.

387
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,046
And we have it all to ourselves.

388
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,449
There are no other guests here,
but out of every feature you've seen

389
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,953
on these islands so far,
this one stands above the rest.

390
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,456
In the middle of the island
is a massive waterslide,

391
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,293
even though literally eight year
olds ride that waterslide,

392
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,261
I might still chicken out
because I'm afraid of heights.

393
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,963
But before taking on the water
slide,

394
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,632
we checked out the other features,
like how there's over

395
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,835
a hundred jetskis on this island.

396
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,236
It's a bit overkill.

397
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,137
And not to mention

398
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:02,241
there's a literal zip lines
that span across manmade beaches.

399
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,275
What's the helmet for?

400
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,109
What am I going to hit?

401
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,277
The ground, bro.

402
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,012
Because sometimes people fall off.

403
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,681
- This is like really scary.
- Yeah.

404
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,583
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

405
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,451
Karl, you're kind of far behind.

406
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,819
This is awesome.

407
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,922
This is actually not that crazy.

408
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:20,659
And if you own this island,
you can host over 13,000

409
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:24,730
of your friends at any of these
five gargantuan pools.

410
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,833
Oh, this kind of looks like
it was made in Minecraft.

411
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,302
And it's so funny
just seeing my two friends in it.

412
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,538
Nolan looks like a tiny speck.

413
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,740
For $250 million,

414
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,076
this island,
of course, has exotic animals.

415
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,177
Is that a peacock?

416
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,012
Sir, I need to take
you in for questioning.

417
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,113
Sir?

418
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,515
And even every game you can imagine,

419
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,386
I wish there is the 13,000 people
that are normally here,

420
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,821
to watch how bad he is at Cornhole.

421
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,189
Is that soccer pool?

422
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,625
This island has things
I didn't even know existed.

423
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,794
But something I noticed is
there were way too many lifeguards

424
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,897
at this island
for just the four of us.

425
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,465
How many lifeguards
are on this island?

426
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,033
- Over 100
- Really?

427
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,402
With this many lifeguards,
you would have to try to drown.

428
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:06,138
So I thought it'd be fun
if we gave them all the day off.

429
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,307
Has anyone ever rented
this island before?

430
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,008
No one.

431
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,043
- This is the first.
- Dude, you are leaning back.

432
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,244
You look way too relaxed.

433
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,680
And after all 100 lifeguards went down,

434
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,716
they decided to hype up
the boys and I for our turn on the slide.

435
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,352
Here we go!

436
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,189
Oh my Gosh!

437
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,258
Boys, you want to know
what's even scarier than that?

438
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,192
What?

439
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,060
That one.

440
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,428
Why is it so terrifying tonight?

441
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,030
It looks so scary.

442
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:33,632
We can skip it.

443
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:37,436
Towering at over 135 feet tall.

444
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,940
This is the tallest water
slide in all of North America.

445
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,108
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

446
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,343
It's like a skyscraper.

447
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,644
But I'm scared.

448
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:48,113
Daredevil's Peak.
What a soothing name.

449
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,148
Very inviting.

450
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,516
We're so up.

451
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,817
It's kind of freaking me out.

452
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,652
All right, we made it to the top.

453
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,020
Are you guys just waiting for us up
here?

454
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,155
Yeah.

455
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,290
Listen
to how intense the wind is up here.

456
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,625
Oh, don't look down.

457
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,027
Look how crazy the island
looks. Oh, my God.

458
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,395
- Karl!
- No.

459
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,563
Nolan! Oh!

460
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,365
Would you say nose goes is enforceable?

461
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,334
Nose goes is enforceable.

462
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,468
There we go!

463
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,370
The lifeguards said you got to go, Nolan.

464
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,604
I love you, Mom.

465
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,139
I'll see you on the other side.

466
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:14,940
All right, go.

467
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,343
Oh my God!

468
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,180
Oh, I got hit by a truck.

469
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,481
Let's do this.

470
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,917
You better come down after me.

471
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,684
Okay.

472
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:27,786
Oh, God.

473
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,288
Why is it so fast?

474
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,123
Is it actually that scary?

475
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,362
I'm going to do this
for your entertainment,

476
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,630
even though giant rides scare me.

477
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:40,799
Here we go.

478
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,702
That is going so fast.

479
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,205
And even though
I was basically just drowning

480
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,340
the entire time down this waterslide,

481
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,076
I gotta say this whole island
was pretty awesome.
