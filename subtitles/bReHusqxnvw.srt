1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
these are the lowest chance things to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,500
ever happen in the world like this guy

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,600
who found himself randomly on Google

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,120
Maps or this person's car that's about

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,219
to get crushed by a massive Boulder but

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,259
randomly stopped but first we need to

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,120
react to this crazy ax throw okay so

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,960
they're throwing the axes whoa okay oh

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,100
that's pretty cool we need to go try to

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,460
recreate that how can you even cut metal

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,840
what are the odds very low because

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,279
that's the whole point of the video wait

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,800
he's gonna hit it out he's not

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,140
oh

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,520
I don't believe he doesn't even have an

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,079
emotional reaction he didn't believe

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,059
that just happened wait what is he doing

18
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,219
