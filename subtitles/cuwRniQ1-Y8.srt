00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
hi everyone my name is alina rice and

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,600
today i'm going to raise a question to

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,799
you this is something that i have felt

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,720
and observed a lot around myself and

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,559
want to know that if this is something

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,719
that bothers you too okay so this

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,799
definitely bothers me

8
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,560
um okay let me just quickly come to the

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,600
point

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
and this is kind of ironic coming from

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,840
me because okay you'll know why i'm

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,160
saying this is ironic the point is that

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,519
indians unnecessarily speak english all

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,960
the time

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,800
you're going on the road somebody would

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,040
stop you request you to stop and ask for

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,120
direction they will ask in english then

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,760
you're supposed to reply in english okay

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,559
asking a question in english would imply

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,680
that you would

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,399
respond in english now this is slightly

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,480
difficult for people who do not know

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,480
english people who don't understand

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,640
english or who are not very fluent in it

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,239
or do not have that kind of confidence

26
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,039
to reply in english now it gets awkward

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,879
for those people i've seen that in my

28
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,199
own mother's case it is slightly

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,920
embarrassing i don't know um

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,239
not okay it may not be embarrassing for

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,720
me but it definitely is embarrassing for

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,880
her and i can see it on her face

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
because somehow we attach the status to

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,280
the language and

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,640
i feel that it's i okay this is just my

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,520
opinion i may not be right in your eyes

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,640
here but okay respectfully let me know

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,920
if i am not right according to you but i

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,600
feel that

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
it's slightly rude it's slightly rude if

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
you're just assuming that the other

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,000
person would know english because you

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
know the kind of hype we attach in our

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,320
country to this language and assuming

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,680
the other person would know english

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,040
would be like

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,640
if they don't know it then you're

48
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,880
embarrassing them most of the times in

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,200
our country looking at the person you

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,600
can actually see and

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,280
assume

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,880
more or less assume that the other

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
person would know hindi or would not

54
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,200
know hindi most of the times you can see

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,560
it from the way they are i think it's

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,759
easy to predict right so if it is easy

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,680
to predict that somebody would

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,759
understand hindi or not why don't you

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,160
put forward your question in hindi it

60
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,920
will get easier for the other person

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,560
also to handle customer care people they

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,319
always start their conversations in

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,319
english you see people ordering stuff on

64
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,000
the counters like mcdonald's and

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,560
everywhere it's always in english

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,120
i remember the first time i went up to a

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,239
mcdonald's counter i was a little girl i

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,400
was not very confident in english to be

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,239
honest and i remember the hesitation

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,720
that i felt walking up to that counter i

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,480
remember actually

72
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:36,770
um

73
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,560
[Music]

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,760
so strange i remember speaking those

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,239
words in my mind to myself okay these

76
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,400
are 20 words that i have to say to this

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,040
girl i was actually repeating those

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040
words in my head okay these are the

79
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,560
things i have to order and then she will

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,319
ask me this and i'm this and this is the

81
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,160
reply that i'm gonna give her

82
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,319
that's how i was actually preparing my

83
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,120
conversation for just ordering a burger

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,200
i mean what is wrong

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,560
why can't we just simply speak in hindi

86
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,959
with each other why do we have to always

87
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,480
unnecessarily speak in english to each

88
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,519
other all the time i know my channel has

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,879
more than 450 i don't know 4 30 40

90
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,680
english videos just because this is the

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,760
genre that i've picked for myself but

92
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
otherwise i

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,959
love speaking hindi i am so confident in

94
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,760
hindi hindi comes to me naturally

95
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,599
i feel i can

96
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,640
express more in hindi i feel that i love

97
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
this language and

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,560
the way i can

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,920
um express my happiness my sorrow my joy

100
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,560
and my my excitement and everything in

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,680
hindi i can never never justify the

102
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,159
feeling in any other language but still

103
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,400
somehow we always choose to speak in

104
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,799
english

105
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,720
please don't bash me for this don't tell

106
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,760
me

107
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,840
don't tell me things that may disappoint

108
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,239
me later just respectfully tell me if

109
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,640
you agree with me or you don't i feel

110
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,159
that we should speak more hindi in india

111
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,599
that's all that i have to say because

112
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,280
i've actually been to some other

113
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,280
countries of the world like i've been to

114
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,639
thailand and all and i'm telling you the

115
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,720
value they're attached to their language

116
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
is awesome

117
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,080
like they're not even they they'll just

118
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,560
tell you on the face okay no english no

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,960
english no english and then you have to

120
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,600
know explaining what you have to do with

121
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,440
them where you have to go wherever you

122
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,040
where you've got to get down what you

123
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,000
want from that person is your problem

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,840
they will just tell you on their face no

125
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,960
english and then you're on your own

126
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,120
i hope you get the point this is not to

127
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
insult or embarrass anyone this is not

128
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
to attract any unnecessary attention to

129
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,960
myself i don't want to do that this is

130
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,320
just me speaking my mind and my heart

131
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
this is just me

132
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,199
talking about the kind of appreciation

133
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,759
and love that i have for my language and

134
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,600
this is just me sharing a thought with

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,080
my friends and i just want to know if

136
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,800
you feel if you agree with me on this or

137
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,039
you don't it's all right if you don't

138
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,840
but but i think a major section of you

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,759

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,479
