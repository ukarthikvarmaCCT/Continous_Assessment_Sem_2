1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,190
In September of 2009, a critical event unfolded
in the rugged terrains of the Shuryak Valley

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,730
in Kunar province, Afghanistan.

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,330
A powerful Blackhawk helicopter, on its mission
to rescue wounded Marines, found itself under

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,630
intense fire from Taliban militiamen.

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,260
The situation on the ground was dire; the
defending forces were outnumbered, and the

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,949
Blackhawk's position became increasingly perilous
amid the escalating firefight.

7
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,580
In this tense moment, pilot Patrick Benson
made a sudden and unexpected appearance in

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,700
the most surprising of helicopters, barely
suited for the situation.

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,680
His Bell OH-58, typically used for light reconnaissance,
entered the fray.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,041
Despite its compact size, the OH-58 was no
stranger to combat.

11
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:48,820
It could be armed with an array of weapons,
including Stinger air-to-air missiles, a .50-caliber

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:55,250
machine gun, podded 70mm Hydra rockets, and
AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles.

13
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,590
It was a bold move, and Benson drew the enemy's
fire towards the small helicopter, risking

14
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,220
his life to protect the wounded Marines.

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,900
The OH-58 took several hits, with its nose
being punctured by small arms fire, injuring

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,380
both Benson and his co-pilot.

17
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,200
Despite his injuries, Benson persisted in
his efforts, ensuring the Blackhawk could

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,369
safely evacuate the area.

19
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:19,220
This act of bravery and dedication to his
fellow soldiers would later earn Benson and

20
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,090
his co-pilot the accolades they rightly deserved.

21
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,230
Moreover, this incident showcased the resilience
and dependability of the OH-58, aptly nicknamed

22
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:38,580
the Kiowa Warrior…"

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,450
The Ugly Duckling
Following the success of the American-made

24
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,280
helicopters deployed during the Far East campaigns
of World War 2, the military envisioned and

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,549
developed several types of rotary wing aircraft
tailored for different uses.

26
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:56,649
Besides providing transport for troops and
carrying supplies for logistical support,

27
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:01,149
such as the Korean War era Sioux, or the future
Chinook, helicopters began to be employed

28
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:05,420
for retrieving other helicopters and aircraft
and even delivering artillery and ground vehicles

29
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,020
across difficult terrain.

30
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,830
Others, such as the future Bell AH-1 Cobra,
would find their purpose as gunships armed

31
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,120
to the teeth, ready to provide immediate fire
support to allied ground troops and effectively

32
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,239
decimate the enemy.

33
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,750
As American involvement in Vietnam increased,
the United States Navy commenced looking for

34
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,489
a replacement for the Bell OH-13 Sioux and
Hiller OH-23 Raven for the reconnaissance

35
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:28,720
role.

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,660
Both helicopters had been successfully used
during the Korean War for MEDVAC or medical

37
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,660
evacuation.

38
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,810
However, they struggled with their piston
engines, offering a maximum output of 250

39
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,200
shaft horsepower.

40
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,080
On behalf of the Army, the US Navy approached
over 20 helicopter manufacturers for the submission

41
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,110
of proposals for a Light Observation Helicopter
or LOH.

42
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,120
The designs had to be powered by an Allison
250C-20B free turbine engine, and their primary

43
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,060
role was to be the eyes in the skies for military
intelligence.

44
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,890
Besides reconnaissance, the rotary-wing aircraft
had to be capable of ground attack, transport,

45
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,910
and medical evacuation roles.

46
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,940
Of the twelve helicopter manufacturers that
entered the competition, only three were shortlisted.

47
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:19,020
Bell presented the YOH-4A or Model 206, Hughes
the YOH-6A Model 369, and Hiller the YOH-5A

48
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,330
FH1100.

49
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,629
Bell produced five prototypes of its helicopter
that were tested thoroughly in 1962.

50
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:30,879
During its maiden flight, Army and Navy personnel
referred to the YOH-4A as the Ugly Duckling

51
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,020
when compared to the competitors.

52
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,659
It was not a good omen.

53
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:43,340
Ranger to the Rescue
After testing the Bell, Hiller, and Hughes

54
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,750
helicopters, the Army ultimately settled for
the Hughes OH-6 Cayuse “Loach” in May

55
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,600
1965.

56
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,120
Despite the Army's decision, Dave Ostrowski,
an Army aeronautical engineer in the LOH contest,

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,310
said in issue 10 of Take Off magazine that
Bell's model: (QUOTE) “Sprang off the ground

58
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,849
like a homesick angel.

59
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,020
It had power, speed, and maneuverability.

60
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,799
It felt good.

61
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,049
It was a super ship to fly.”

62
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,819
Nevertheless, it was not over yet for Bell.

63
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:14,170
They knew their helicopter had potential,
and the company decided to market it for civilian

64
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,170
use.

65
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,359
But first, the engineers had to redesign the
Ugly Duckling to attract customers.

66
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,360
The displeasing bubble face canopy and small
fuselage had to be reshaped to be easier on

67
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,270
the eye, provide more space for the cramped
quarters of the three passengers, and ample

68
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,190
cargo space.

69
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:35,380
In January 1966, Bell presented a redesigned
fuselage and dubbed the new helicopter the

70
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,110
Model 206A Jet Ranger.

71
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,340
The fuselage was more aesthetically pleasing,
added over 16 cubic feet of cargo space for

72
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,340
luggage, and made the passenger compartment
more pleasing, providing enough space for

73
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,030
up to five people.

74
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,600
Furthermore, the Jet Ranger was also modified
internally.

75
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,479
It was now powered by a 317 horsepower Allison
250-C18 engine.

76
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,090
The Ranger had its maiden flight the same
month and experienced no issues.

77
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,139
It became a best seller in the coming months,
becoming a familiar sight around the United

78
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,139
States.

79
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:10,660
The Jet Ranger was adopted by the government,
forest services, law enforcement, news broadcasters,

80
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,560
and tour companies.

81
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,930
Bell's Jet Ranger became so recognizable that
even Italian manufacturer Agusta acquired

82
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,700
the production rights to fly the Jet Ranger
over the skies of Europe.

83
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:25,910
In January 1968, Bell scored big when the
Jet Ranger was solicited by the US Navy to

84
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,950
come up with a modified variant for flight
training.

85
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,370
Over 40 TH-57 Sea Rangers were produced.

86
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,850
And there was more to come for Model 206.

87
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:44,660
The Kiowa
While Bell's Jet Ranger flew thousands of

88
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,919
people across the US without incidents, Hughes’
OH-6A Cayuse struggled in Southeast Asia.

89
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:54,000
The fighting in Vietnam had turned into a
meat grinder.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,010
In January 1968, the North Vietnamese launched
a mass offensive during the Tet New Year festivities,

91
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,880
and dozens of cities were sieged by the Communist
forces.

92
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,160
Thanks to the effectiveness of the Ho Chi
Minh Trail, the North Vietnamese Army was

93
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,690
now supplied and equipped with modern Soviet
and Chinese equipment, including anti-aircraft

94
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,470
countermeasures that were making quick work
of the American OH-6A Cayuses.

95
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:20,060
The Cayuse was exposed to enemy fire during
scouting and artillery fire correction missions,

96
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,660
making it an easy target for hidden Viet Cong
or NVA troops.

97
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,599
Casualties for Hughes’ helicopter were piling
up, and the company could not keep up with

98
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,320
production and its costs.

99
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,020
The Army reopened the LOH competition because
Hughes could not meet production demands.

100
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,460
Bell submitted its upgraded Model 206 Jet
Ranger and won the contract.

101
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,759
It was designated OH-58A and named the Kiowa,
following the Army's tradition of honoring

102
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,889
Native American tribes.

103
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:52,389
The OH-59 Kiowa was delivered to Army inventories
in May 1969.

104
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:57,650
It had a length of 34 feet, a width of 35
feet, and a height of 12.9 feet.

105
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,139
The scout helicopter had a weight of 3,289
pounds.

106
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,780
Compared to its civilian variant, the Kiowa
featured military instruments, multiple radios,

107
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,260
Army olive drab livery, and deflecting blades
above the canopy and belove the nose to avoid

108
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,919
crashes with electrical wires.

109
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:19,900
The Kiowa was also powered by an Allison T63-A-700
engine rated at 315 horsepower mounted atop

110
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,660
and to the rear of the passenger cabin.

111
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,610
The cockpit was well-forward and provided
all-around visibility for the pilot and co-pilot

112
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:34,150
thanks to the large windscreens and the option
to remove hinged side doors.

113
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,620
Changing the Mission
Behind the cockpit, the passenger cabin featured

114
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,009
entry-exit doors and enough room for three
soldiers or two medical litters.

115
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:47,750
The first Kiowa variant featured a flexible
twin-bladed main rotor that would later be

116
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,470
replaced with a four-bladed one with the OH-58D
model.

117
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:57,639
The first batch of Kiowas arrived in Vietnam
in August 1969 to support the Hughes Cayuse

118
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,389
in the reconnaissance, observation, and medical
evacuation roles.

119
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:06,389
The Kiowas were lightly armed with either
an M129 40-millimeter automatic grenade launcher

120
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:12,900
or a powerful 7.62-millimeter M134 Minigun
that could fire up to 4,000 rounds per minute.

121
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,449
During a North Vietnamese offensive in April
1972, John Paul Vann, a US civilian advisor

122
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:24,240
who often piloted Kiowas, directly coordinated
the attack of AC130s, jet fighters, Cobras,

123
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,349
and Hueys to destroy enemy formations trying
to overrun Firebase Delta in the Highlands.

124
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:34,919
In his book, A Bright Shining Lie, Author
Neil Sheehan recalls that Vann, unsatisfied

125
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,241
with providing guidance for US aircraft, began
stocking his Kiowa with as many supplies as

126
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:43,190
the helicopter could handle to deliver them
to Firebase Delta.

127
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,660
Six times the brave man and his Kiowa delivered
ammunition and other supplies to the besieged

128
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,140
troops under enemy ground fire.

129
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,269
Weeks later, Vann and his Kiowa were landed
in a ravine to extract US and South Vietnamese

130
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,800
advisors while enemy tanks approached.

131
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,200
The helicopter escaped unscratched.

132
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,750
But Vann's luck soon ran out.

133
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:08,840
On June 9, 1972, he and his entire crew were
lost when his Kiowa crashed into a hill due

134
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,850
to low visibility and light rain.

135
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,370
Over 310 Kiowas served in Vietnam between
1969 and 1973.

136
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:22,820
More than 50 of them were combat losses.

137
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,390
The Warrior
Following the end of the Vietnam War, the

138
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:33,360
US and NATO prepared for a possible large-scale
Soviet Invasion of Western Europe.

139
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,940
The Soviets had AA defenses that were far
more effective than the highly effective Strela

140
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,040
2-man portable air defense system.

141
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,660
This led to an improved variant of the Kiowa
equipped with an AN/APR-39A Radar Warning

142
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,959
Receiver to inform the crew about enemy radars
and night vision goggles for night operations.

143
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,960
A more powerful engine made the helicopter
faster and more maneuverable.

144
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,010
This was the Charlie variant or OH-58C.

145
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:02,779
Nevertheless, this variant did not solve the
armament issue the Kiowa faced since Vietnam.

146
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:09,019
Meanwhile, the Army was hard at work introducing
the iconic UH-60 Blackhawk and the AH-64 Apache.

147
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:14,990
In 1981, the Army Helicopter Program upgraded
the Kiowa with sophisticated sensors, a thermal

148
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,510
imager, a laser designator, and the iconic
MMS or Mast Mounted Sight that made the Kiowa

149
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,510
easily recognizable.

150
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:28,440
The Kiowa Warrior, or the OH-58D variant,
was fitted with a Rolls-Royce T703-AD-700A

151
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,550
turboshaft engine providing 650 horsepower
and a top speed of 149 miles per hour.

152
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,940
It had a range of 345 miles and a service
ceiling of over 15,000 feet.

153
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,329
The Warrior packed some punch and was armed
with 12.7-millimeter machine guns in either

154
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:50,640
M296 or M3P mounts, Hellfire-guided anti-tank
missiles, Hydra 70 high-explosive unguided

155
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,519
rockets, and AIMS-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles.

156
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,730
During the 1980s and 1990s, over 400 Kiowas
were upgraded to the Warrior variant, becoming

157
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,440
crucial for their new armed light scout role
during the conflicts of the Middle East in

158
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,880
the same decade.

159
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,070
Iraq and Iran were engulfed in a power struggle
that resulted in US involvement in providing

160
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,779
escort services to merchant ships in the Persian
Gulf.

161
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,960
The Kiowas were bound for the Persian Gulf.

162
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:23,510
Reagan's War on Drugs
Kiowa Warriors replaced other helicopters

163
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,700
for Operation Prime Chance during the Iran-Iraq
War.

164
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,149
The objective was to escort oil tankers.

165
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:33,670
From February to September 1988, the Kiowas
patrolled the Persian Gulf but were never

166
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,019
engaged by the Iranian Navy.

167
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:40,660
During these operations, the Kiowas cooperated
with Task Force 118 Little Birds, locating

168
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,899
and evading enemy vessels.

169
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,550
One year later, in 1989, they returned to
the Middle East when Iraq invaded Kuwait.

170
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:53,750
As Operation Desert Shield turned into Operation
Desert Storm, over 115 Kiowas were deployed

171
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,870
for different combat roles.

172
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,310
Like in Vietnam, the Kiowas spotted Iraqi
objectives for Apache helicopters and other

173
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,329
attack aircraft to hunt them down.

174
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:06,280
They also provided artillery fire correction
to properly strike the enemy.

175
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,160
No Kiowa Warrior was lost in combat during
the war against Iraq during the Gulf War.

176
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,070
During this time, the Kiowas were also dispatched
to the US following Reagan's War on Drugs

177
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,570
Policy.

178
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:23,290
The National Guard Bureau created Reconnaissance
and Aerial Interdiction Detachments or RAIDs,

179
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,519
of which over 80 were Kiowas that conducted
more than 1,200 counterdrug reconnaissance

180
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,360
and interdiction operations.

181
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,740
At the dawn of the XXI century, the Kiowas
were again deployed to the Middle East as

182
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,110
part of the War on Terror.

183
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:41,079
The OH-58D became part of the air units participating
in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring

184
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:43,139
Freedom in Afghanistan.

185
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:49,170
According to Bell, the Kiowas flew over 820,000
combat hours by April 2013.

186
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:54,160
Over 35 helicopters were lost in combat operations
and accidents before American retirement from

187
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,709
Afghanistan.

188
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:05,199
Drawing Enemy Fire
While in Afghanistan, Chief Warrant Officer

189
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:09,730
Patrick Benson flew numerous reconnaissance
and security missions on a Kiowa, becoming

190
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,300
the eyes in the sky for American attack helicopters.

191
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,850
In September 2009, Benson and his co-pilot
were providing security and reconnaissance

192
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,640
for infantry attacking Taliban troops in a
mountain in what is known today as the Shuriak

193
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
Valley.

194
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,230
Benson left the area for a refuel, and minutes
later, the Marines left behind were ambushed.

195
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:33,330
During the fight, two Marines were hurt, and
Benson was called again to provide Medevac

196
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,330
security.

197
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,940
The Blackhawk helicopter dispatched to hoist
up the wounded Marines was immediately attacked

198
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,209
by the enemy, threatening the extraction.

199
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:44,470
The men on the ground did what they could
to fight off the enemy attack, but they were

200
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:49,519
outnumbered, and the Blackhawk’s safety
turned precarious with every second that passed.

201
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,290
It was then when Benson’s Kiowa appeared
out of nowhere and did the unbelievable for

202
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,130
a light reconnaissance helicopter of its class:
it began to draw enemy fire away from the

203
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,130
Blackhawk.

204
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,040
Soon, the small helicopter’s nose was punctured
by small arms fire, wounding Benson and leaving

205
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,910
his co-pilot unconscious.

206
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:11,470
Nevertheless, Benson did not falter and continued
to assist until the Blackhawk safely evacuated

207
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,160
the area.

208
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,420
With his aircraft failing and his best-man
Adam Stead wounded, Benson landed at the nearest

209
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,320
base to save his co-pilot and his Kiowa.

210
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,220
Due to his extreme bravery shown in combat,
Benson was awarded the American Legion Valor

211
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,080
Award, proving that even a small helicopter,
such as the Kiowa, can change the tide of

212
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,019
battle if used properly.

213
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:35,340
The Army officially retired the Kiowa from
service in July 2020 after it selected the

214
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,260
Bell 360 Invictus and Sikorsky's Raider X
as possible replacements for the Future Attack

215
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,610
Reconnaissance Aircraft program.

216
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,740
Nevertheless, the Kiowa remains in operation
with several allied nations across the globe,

217
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,190
proving that after more than 50 years of service,
it continues to excel as a reconnaissance

218
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:58,570
helicopter.
