00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,470
 Welcome to Techno Ruhez, this
 is the first video of our in MWC.

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,010
There is a lot of noise, 
I apologize for that.

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:19,240
But here we have come to the Infinix booth and we have got to witness two big technologies.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,690
The first thing is that 
I have this phone.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,330
This is Infinix's eColorShift
 technology smartphone.

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,580
It has Prism 3 technology.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,480
If you look at the back, 
it glows in different colors.

8
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,530
And it reacts according 
to the design you want.

9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:43,030
That is, if you want to wave someone or want some other design, you can do that here.

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:50,170
You get 8 basic colors in this and you can
 customize this color in 100 different ways.

11
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,200
You get to see a lot of amazing 
technologies in this.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,800
And in the future, such phones
 of Infinix will come to the market,

13
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,230
in which we will get
 ColorShift technology.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,920
Its back panel is quite 
premium than normal phones 

15
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,830
As I was telling you, if 
you look at this back panel,

16
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,270
you will feel that this 
is a front display.

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,480
But this is not a front display,
 this is a back panel.

18
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,380
And if you look here, 
it glows like this.

19
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,990
It will look like there is a camera in the 
display, but it is not like that.

20
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,870
This is a back design.

21
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,700
So this kind of technology will
 be in the future smartphones,

22
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,100
where the whole back 
panel will glow in different colors,

23
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,980
which you can customize 
according to your needs.

24
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,180
Do tell us in the comments
 how did you like this technology.

25
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,470
And this is our 
AirCharge technology.

26
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,250
You will see that this phone
 is getting charged here.

27
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,810
And this is a device of Infinix.

28
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,670
And in this device, you just have
 to take your phone close to it.

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,050
You don't have to
 connect it with a wire.

30
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,430
You don't have to 
touch it wirelessly.

31
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,870
It's not like you put it 
in a wireless charger.

32
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,500
As soon as I take it here, you will see 
that the phone has started charging.

33
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,260
You can see that the
 phone is charging.

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,760
I haven't done anything and 
the phone is charging here.

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,380
This is AirCharge technology.

36
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,690
Right now, Max you can 
see the charging speed of 7.5W.

37
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,920
It's 20cm.

38
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,990
It won't work from here.

39
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,900
I will have to take it very close.

40
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,290
And when I go, you will see
 that the charging has started.

41
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,810
The distance you get
 here is not much.

42
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,760
It's very less.

43
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:32,870
If you come up to 10cm, then
 it provides you with a charging speed of 1-5W.

44
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,110
So this is their 
AirCharge technology.

45
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,610
Infinix has done it here.

46
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,700
Which other brand.... 
I think Oppo has done it before.

47
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,070
Now Infinix has done it here.

48
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,840
I would like to test it again.

49
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,170
This is the phone.

50
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,640
As soon as we take it here, you 
will see that the charging has started.

51
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,680
This is how AirCharge
 technology works here.

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,980
We will get to see this in
 the market very soon.

53
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,170
And who knows, we might get 30W, 50W,
 60W fast charging through AirCharge in the future.

54
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,200
And before I go, I will give
 you an exclusive news.

55
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,250
It is being said that Infinix will launch a 
flagship smartphone very soon.

56
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,400
Many people complain that Infinix 
does not launch flagship smartphones.

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,060
Why don't they do it?

58
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,390
So we have come to their booth.

59
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,730
And they have shared 
this video with us.

60
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,560
It is being said that a very powerful 
chipset is going to be installed.

61
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,020
And this chipset is not any else
 but Mediatek Dimensity 9300.

62
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,710
We have also spoken 
to Mediatek people here.

63
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,980
And they have also confirmed that this
 chipset is going to be installed in Infinix phones.

64
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,360
And they are going to give it to you.

65
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,970
So it is very good news that Infinix will 
launch a flagship smartphone.

66
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,020
In which Mediatek
 Dimensity 9300 is going to be installed.

67
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,840
So let's hope for the best.

68
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,920
I hope you will like today's video.

69
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,870
I have shown you three technologies.

70
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,790
E-Colorshift technology, AirCharge 
technology and a flagship smartphone from Infinix.
