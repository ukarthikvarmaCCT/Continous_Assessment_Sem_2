00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:32,862
Greetings to all of you.

2
00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:34,536
You must be wondering
what I am doing here.

3
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:35,846
I'm neither the protagonist
nor the antagonist.

4
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:38,055
The story of the film takes us to
London, Turkey, Pakistan..

5
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:39,269
..and many other countries.

6
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:40,790
So, you may not be able to understand
the languages..

7
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,166
..spoken by different nationalities.

8
00:00:42,246 --> 00:00:46,345
We could've provided subtitles, but
visuals and audio have different impact.

9
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:49,797
So, we've made the characters
speak in Hindi language..

10
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:53,077
..so that you can enjoy
each and every scene in the film..

11
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:54,559
..and understand it well.

12
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:58,757
Don't move from your seats as you're
going to watch a sensational movie.

13
00:00:58,837 --> 00:01:00,019
Enjoy. Thank you.

14
00:01:43,582 --> 00:01:45,533
Send this file to the Crime Branch.
- Okay, sir.

15
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,243
Hello.

16
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,678
They are the two Algonia murder suspects.

17
00:01:56,911 --> 00:02:00,229
The Istanbul police headquarters
has announced..

18
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,600
..a reward of 50,000 lira to the person
who can share their information.

19
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:15,729
Look for them in that direction.
- Okay, sir.

20
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:59,675
Come with us quietly. Come on.

21
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:04,982
Get in the car.

22
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:34,998
Okay, I'll handle everything.
Don't worry.

23
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:36,231
We've got the girl.

24
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:38,382
We'll find the man too.

25
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,241
I'll call you as soon as we get him.

26
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,226
Okay, sir.

27
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:48,403
C'mon speak up. Where is he?

28
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:50,106
You've so many sidekicks.

29
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:52,917
Tell them to find him.
- Shut up!

30
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,514
How dare you argue with me?

31
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:56,264
You've two options.

32
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:59,391
First, you call him here
and we'll set you free or..

33
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:01,667
..I'll kill both of you here.

34
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:03,139
Anything else?

35
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,891
When he'll come you won't be left with
any option as it'll be time for action.

36
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,574
Shut up!

37
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:13,016
I've easily caught you.

38
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:14,880
Now you know how powerful I am.

39
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,346
I caught you. It's his turn now.

40
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,456
What did you say?

41
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:20,053
You think you found me?

42
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:21,478
It's completely opposite of
what you think.

43
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,289
He sent me here to find you.

44
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:26,804
Call him. Let's see how powerful he is.

45
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:30,867
He has travelled a distance of
6000 km to find the truth.

46
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:34,119
He can definitely travel
one kilometer to get to you.

47
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,424
Your boss is here.

48
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,042
C'mon tell me who you work for
and who is the mastermind.

49
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,920
Speak up or you'll die.
You won't be spared.

50
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,628
C'mon speak up.

51
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:05,093
If I don't tell you then you'll kill me
and if I tell you then you'll be killed.

52
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:06,327
It's your turn to die now.

53
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:15,611
Hello. Greetings.
- How are you?

54
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:17,552
Hello. Hello.
- We haven't seen you for a long time.

55
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:18,575
I was busy.

56
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:19,560
Hello.
- Hello.

57
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,669
Offer them tea.

58
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:22,123
Please attend the other guests too.
- Okay.

59
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:24,341
Hello. How are you?
- Hello.

60
00:09:24,724 --> 00:09:25,594
He'll soon be here.

61
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,655
Hello.
- Hello. How are you?

62
00:09:26,735 --> 00:09:27,487
Please remain seated.

63
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,848
Hello.
- Brother, why are you waiting here?

64
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:32,878
I'm not Shravan's friend right now.

65
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,072
I've come to meet the Deputy CM
to discuss business.

66
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:38,140
Doesn't matter if it's business
or personal matter. Come inside.

67
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,182
Come on.
- Okay, let's go.

68
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:42,309
Tie it properly.
Tie the laces properly, dad.

69
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:43,992
How will I tie the laces
if you move so much, son?

70
00:09:44,072 --> 00:09:47,138
You're the Deputy CM
but at home you're attending your son.

71
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:50,102
Take it. - Auntie, he didn't do
my homework properly.

72
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:52,368
The teacher scolded me because of him.

73
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:54,137
This is his punishment.

74
00:09:54,217 --> 00:09:55,944
Are you going to expose me
before everybody? - Look there.

75
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:57,139
Hi Deepak!
- Hello.

76
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:58,564
Bye, my child.
- Bye, dad.

77
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:00,190
Come.
- Guddu, take your bag.

78
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,159
Dad loved your solar project.

79
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,603
It'll get approved today.

80
00:10:03,683 --> 00:10:06,339
Shravan, I incurred a lot of loss
in business.

81
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:08,509
I would've gone bankrupt.

82
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:10,259
But, you helped me as a true friend.

83
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:13,204
You've done a favour by giving me
this project worth 4000 crores.

84
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:14,745
Thanks for being a true friend.

85
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:18,369
Deepak, my dad is the CM
but I neither took any favour from him..

86
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:19,727
..nor did he do any favour to me.

87
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,668
I'm breaking the rule for the first time.

88
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:22,864
I know it very well.

89
00:10:22,944 --> 00:10:25,456
The big players of the business
were after this project.

90
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:28,190
But, you helped me bag the project.
Thank you, bro.

91
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,508
That's okay.
Work with diligence and honesty.

92
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:33,602
After all it's a matter of my reputation.
- Of course.

93
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:34,883
Come and meet my dad.
- Yes.

94
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,105
Come in, son.

95
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:40,094
I'm signing your file.

96
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:43,880
This is going to be
my last signature as the CM.

97
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,932
Why are you saying so, uncle?

98
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,816
Didn't you friend tell you anything?
- No.

99
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:50,937
I'm planning to put forward my son
as the CM candidate in the next election..

100
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,954
..and retire from politics.

101
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,856
How long will old people like us
hamper the career of young people?

102
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:58,883
Only young people can bring
about significant changes.

103
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:01,712
Take this.
The government has given you this project.

104
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:04,189
You'll be responsible
for the success of this project.

105
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:05,164
I won't disappoint you.

106
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,641
Deepak, you're really lucky for me.
- Why? What happened?

107
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:12,919
The IDM party is ready for an alliance
with our party in the next election.

108
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:16,064
National leader Mr. Indra Gupta
will come to our state on..

109
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:19,636
..the 10th of next month for
the joint conference of both the parties.

110
00:11:19,716 --> 00:11:20,631
Is that true?
- Yes, dad.

111
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:22,189
We've only twelve days
to prepare for the meeting.

112
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:24,359
We must start the preparations
in full swing.

113
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,406
Hand over all the responsibilities to me.

114
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:27,868
I'll bear all the expenses.

115
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:29,953
That's great. Are you bribing us
for giving you the tender?

116
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,655
Oh God! What are you saying?
- What else?

117
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:35,700
Deepak, dishonest people
will try to buy your honesty.

118
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:38,491
A weak person will sell himself.

119
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:41,503
One party will offer bribe
and the other one will accept it.

120
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,773
Ignore all this
and focus on the project.

121
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,479
We'll handle the conference. Got it?

122
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:49,908
Uncle.. uncle.. I didn't mean this.

123
00:11:49,988 --> 00:11:51,954
Politics and government are
two different things.

124
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:55,884
Bro, I've started
a new ac manufacturing unit.

125
00:11:55,964 --> 00:12:00,215
If you've no objection then I would
arrange the ac for the conference hall.

126
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:02,061
I've no problem in buying AC from you.

127
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:04,690
Send your invoice and take the payment.
- Okay.

128
00:12:05,144 --> 00:12:06,038
Hello.

129
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:09,308
What did you say?

130
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:14,289
Parade about turn.
- Right. Left. Right.

131
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:34,160
I'm Lieutenant General MJ Rehman.

132
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,709
I'm the chief of Subhash.

133
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:37,190
She's Diya.

134
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:40,097
She's was Subhash's partner
in the operation led by him.

135
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,216
Please come in. Subhash is inside.

136
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:41,828
What happened to him?

137
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:43,568
Two days back he made a plan
to wipe out..

138
00:12:43,648 --> 00:12:45,605
..a terrorist gang positioned
in the borders.

139
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:49,420
The operation was successful but
on his way back he got shot in the leg.

140
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:51,725
Subhash.. Subhash..
what has happened to you?

141
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,313
What has happened to you, my son?
- Subhash.

142
00:12:53,514 --> 00:12:55,015
He's in induced coma
for the last two days.

143
00:12:55,095 --> 00:12:56,449
Don't worry.
- Don't worry, dad.

144
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,415
Nothing will happen to brother.

145
00:12:57,495 --> 00:13:00,292
Oh God! What has happened to him?

146
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:02,339
Who shot my brother-in-law?

147
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:05,981
I hope you got the answer.

148
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:07,932
Did you think that
I've come here as I'm concerned?

149
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:10,427
I've come to India
only to dance in your funeral.

150
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:16,030
Sister, did you see how much
your husband loves Subhash?

151
00:13:16,623 --> 00:13:17,828
Why won't he love him?

152
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,046
They're good friends
since their college days.

153
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,221
My brother-in-law,
if I find the man who shot you..

154
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:25,889
..I'll treat him as God
and worship him lifelong.

155
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:28,455
My life is in mess
and you've a rocking life. Huh?

156
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:30,769
Sister, please don't marry him.
You'll be ruined.

157
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:34,766
Subhash, don't give unwanted advice
since you didn't get leave.

158
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:37,949
Please keep quiet. It's better to be
a spinster than to marry this fellow.

159
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:39,747
He's a duffer.
He was my senior in college.

160
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:41,028
But, he failed and became my junior.

161
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:42,721
How can you think of keeping
such a beautiful girl unmarried?

162
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:44,174
Her smile can kill anybody.

163
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:46,488
I don't go to the borders
to fight like you.

164
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:49,098
I'm in a MBC, ac office,
posh house, posh cars.

165
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:52,093
Sister, can't you see his buckteeth?

166
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:53,574
Why? Do you want me
to peel carrots for you?

167
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:56,347
Your sister fell in love with
my talent and not teeth.

168
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:57,685
Isn't it?
- Please keep quiet.

169
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:59,024
She's willingly marrying him.
- No!

170
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,057
Priest, carry on with the rituals.

171
00:14:00,137 --> 00:14:01,200
Sister, don't let him tie
the marital chain.

172
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,399
I won't spare him.

173
00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:04,636
Sister, don't do this. Stop!

174
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:05,860
Sister, please stop.

175
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,399
Don't let him tie the marital chain.

176
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,833
Mission accomplished.

177
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,132
Mission over and not accomplished.

178
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,366
To hell with him.

179
00:14:16,741 --> 00:14:18,252
People spend their wedding night
with their wife..

180
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:20,174
..but I spent it in a dental hospital.

181
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:23,339
What has happened to
my dear brother-in-law?

182
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:24,993
Excuse me. The patent needs rest.
- Okay.

183
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,276
Let Subhash take rest.
Please take him out.

184
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:31,230
Brother-in-law, you've gone into coma.

185
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:33,812
I'll go and meet the doctor.

186
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:44,007
Get well soon.

187
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,961
I've got the holy vermilion from
the temple of the Goddess.

188
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:52,278
I promise that
I won't let anything happen to you.

189
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:58,494
I saw how crazy you
were to save your sister's life.

190
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:03,055
Since then I went crazy for you.

191
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:06,153
But, I never had the courage
to express my feelings to you.

192
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:09,557
I forget to breathe when I see you.

193
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:15,647
Do you know three months back
on your birthday I went to your room?

194
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:20,829
I had decided to express my love for you.

195
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:24,845
But, you were in deep sleep.

196
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,560
I was confused
and didn't know if I should wake you.

197
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,524
I mustered a lot of courage
and kissed you.

198
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:34,091
I also said 'I love you'.

199
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,203
But, you didn't feel anything.

200
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:40,428
I'm going to repeat the same thing
as I say 'get well soon'.

201
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,828
And this time too you won't find out.

202
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:48,757
Madam, please don't disturb the patient.

203
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,454
What's this, nurse? Why didn't you come
after a couple of seconds?

204
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,528
I missed a kiss from her.

205
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:04,228
I had to give in to
all of Subhash' demands.

206
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:05,558
He didn't leave me with any option.

207
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:06,390
I'm really sorry.

208
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,206
Subhash, what kind of
immature behavior is this?

209
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:10,950
There were 45 terrorists
in the terrorist camp.

210
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,958
I've wiped them out
with zero casualties.

211
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:17,069
I'm going to get the gallantry award
Keerti Chakra for it after two days.

212
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:21,038
When I was in school
dad never saw me getting any award.

213
00:16:21,118 --> 00:16:22,654
So, I had to stage this drama.

214
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:26,947
This will help him attend the function
and also take a break from his busy life.

215
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:30,380
That's good. But, you scared us.

216
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:32,426
It has helped me.

217
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:35,973
Now I know how much you all love me.

218
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,042
I was joking in the hospital.
- Hey you..

219
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:40,466
I swear on your uncle.
- Was it a joke?

220
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:41,575
Yes. Of course.

221
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:59,933
A terrorist like Syed Ibrahim Malik
has no right to live in Pakistan.

222
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:02,179
He's a stigma for our nation.

223
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:05,286
Terrorists like him defame
the entire community.

224
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:11,099
Brother..
- Yes, tell me.

225
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:12,265
My father is inside.

226
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:13,853
I'm from Karachi.

227
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,736
'What's the problem of
the ruling party that..'

228
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,405
What do you want from me?
- He's member of this party.

229
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:22,115
Brother, the meeting is soon
going to get over. Where were you?

230
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:24,175
We'll protest.

231
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:30,496
I request all of you not to spare
terrorists like him.

232
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:32,437
Hey stop! Who are you?

233
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:34,444
From where have you come?
- Over there..

234
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:37,064
Stop! Hey stop! Catch him!

235
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:38,508
Hey, catch him!
- Stop him!

236
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:41,299
Hey stop!
- This nation is ours..

237
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,475
Hey, catch him!

238
00:17:42,555 --> 00:17:43,842
Who is he?
- Back off.

239
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:44,626
Catch him!

240
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:47,280
He has shot him.

241
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:53,657
Run!
- What's going on?

242
00:17:54,747 --> 00:17:57,654
Run! Run!

243
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:23,747
Greetings!
- Greetings!

244
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:24,971
Malik!

245
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:29,235
You dared to plan
an explosion in our country.

246
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,457
We've given you shelter
but the Pakistan government..

247
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:34,866
..doesn't allow you to
do whatever you wish.

248
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:38,366
If we remove the security cover
from here for a moment..

249
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:41,053
..the Indian government
will trace you and kill you.

250
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,377
He's the fake one.
The one with squint eyes.

251
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:49,763
Where 's the real Malik?

252
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,796
Taheer!

253
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:05,970
Don't you apply kohl in your eyes?

254
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,376
You can't even distinguish between
the real and the fake one.

255
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:09,202
Malik, stop this.

256
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:10,646
Have you forgotten your limitations?

257
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:11,755
Taheer..

258
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:16,756
Taheer, I despise
if anybody challenges me..

259
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:19,538
..or speaks to me in loud voice.

260
00:19:19,796 --> 00:19:23,009
You've killed the opposition leader
and landed us in trouble.

261
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:27,665
You all made me carry out
seventeen blasts in my country.

262
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:32,465
Can't I plan one explosion
in your country?

263
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,731
Neither you nor your government
is looking after me as a favour.

264
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,354
I help you earn crores
and so you look after me.

265
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:42,265
You're a watchman and do your job.

266
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:44,331
Out.

267
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:50,670
Taheer, don't forget that I'm an NRI.

268
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:53,251
Non-reliable Indian.

269
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,408
Goodbye.

270
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:04,161
My dear sisters and brothers,
I'm very glad to see all of you here.

271
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,838
Sir, Malik used to work for us.

272
00:20:07,116 --> 00:20:08,512
Now he has gone out of control.

273
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:10,090
We need to tame him with force.

274
00:20:10,262 --> 00:20:12,012
We'll do that very soon.
- But when, sir?

275
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:14,077
The election in India
will take place soon.

276
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:17,439
The leader of IPTP is Indra Gupta.

277
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,794
As per the latest exit polls
he may be the next PM of India.

278
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:24,499
If that happens then Malik
will be traced and killed even..

279
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:28,216
..if he's in Pakistan
or in any other part of the world.

280
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:33,750
I promise all of you that India's
most wanted criminal Syed Ibrahim Malik..

281
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,810
..will be brought back to India
in thirty days.

282
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,586
If anybody else tries to spread
terrorism in India again..

283
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,953
Yes, tell me.
- The speech is awesome, Mr. Varma.

284
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,207
It means you're watching the television.

285
00:20:44,287 --> 00:20:45,642
But, don't pay heed to his words.

286
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:48,977
Concentrate on the party alliance.

287
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:51,307
Don't worry,
the conference is going to be great.

288
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:56,913
But Mr. Varma, there are two areas
in your list where we can face problems.

289
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:58,801
I'll speak with Mr. Gupta about it.

290
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:00,092
You plan the conference.

291
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:01,311
Okay, sir. Jai Hind.

292
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:04,956
Thanks, Subhash.

293
00:21:05,036 --> 00:21:08,136
Political stress had robbed your dad 
and brother of their peace of mind.

294
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:10,537
Look how relaxed
they are because of you.

295
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:11,661
Coffee?

296
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:16,369
Sister-in-law, didn't you tell your sister
that I prefer tea to coffee?

297
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:18,246
Go and get tea for me.

298
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:30,234
Why are you standing so far?

299
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:31,668
Do you want me to drink it with a straw?

300
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:32,899
Come close to me.

301
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:38,420
Hey shy lady, your mission
in the hospital was incomplete.

302
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,977
Complete it now.
- Only after marriage.

303
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:42,531
Will your husband allow all this?

304
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,540
It is a joke.

305
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:47,743
Enough of all this.
It's just a kiss. C'mon kiss me.

306
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:49,344
Kiss?

307
00:21:49,572 --> 00:21:52,082
The soldier is getting ready
to kiss. Wait.

308
00:21:52,261 --> 00:21:53,767
Then why were you trying to kiss me
the other day?

309
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,535
That's because you were in deep sleep.

310
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,547
I was sleeping that day.
But, today I'm awake.

311
00:21:58,627 --> 00:22:01,930
The mark of the kiss
I gave that day is still there.

312
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:05,742
Find it and then
I'll do whatever you say.

313
00:22:05,822 --> 00:22:07,582
How can the mark of the kiss
be still there after three months?

314
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:09,770
Hey! I've overheard everything.

315
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:11,263
What's this kiss story?

316
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:13,163
Is he disturbing you?

317
00:22:13,243 --> 00:22:14,920
I was watching something. Tik Tok.
- Tik Tok?

318
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,366
Yes, Tik Tok.
- That's a banned app.

319
00:22:16,546 --> 00:22:17,813
Which movie is going on here?

320
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:21,386
Why are you looking here and there?

321
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,192
Which film is it?
- Blue Lagoon.

322
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:26,969
But, it was not remade in Hindi.

323
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,061
It was something else. Right?
- Hold this.

324
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,077
C'mon tell me.

325
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:32,300
How dare you interfere
in somebody's privacy?

326
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:37,763
I can see that you've started speaking
a lot these days.

327
00:22:38,074 --> 00:22:40,811
If you speak again
then I'll dance of your funeral. Got it?

328
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:41,671
What's wrong?

329
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:44,994
So, you'll worship the man who shot me?
- Friend!

330
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:49,441
Keep your mouth shut as long as I'm here.
- Don't hit me.

331
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:51,234
Get lost.

332
00:22:51,314 --> 00:22:52,537
I still have a doubt.

333
00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:53,493
Say it.

334
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:55,597
How can the kiss mark be still intact
after three months

335
00:22:55,677 --> 00:22:56,959
Hey you!
- Don't get angry.

336
00:22:57,162 --> 00:22:58,274
Have a cold drink.
- Get lost.

337
00:22:58,354 --> 00:23:00,067
He uses his hands a lot.

338
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:03,067
Did she kiss with lipstick on her lips or
did she use the indelible electoral ink?

339
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:06,246
You're a strange man.

340
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:08,529
Why do you always argue with my brother
and then keep running from him?

341
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:10,944
Darling, I never hide after an argument.

342
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:12,785
I stay away from him so that
we don't get into another argument.

343
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,403
He has been harassing me
for the last ten years.

344
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:17,315
He's the youngest
and the most pampered one.

345
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,812
Always accept his point of view.
- What?

346
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:22,239
Give him whatever he wants. Now go.

347
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:28,538
My shy girl, the indelible electoral ink
doesn't last this long..

348
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:29,876
..how will the lipstick mark stay?

349
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:31,514
Do you think I'm stupid?
Trying to harass me?

350
00:23:31,594 --> 00:23:32,530
Not at all.

351
00:23:33,175 --> 00:23:36,522
Look for it properly.
- You're very stubborn.

352
00:23:36,796 --> 00:23:41,769
Okay, c'mon kiss me quickly
and I'll check later. - No.

353
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,060
If you don't then I'll kiss you.

354
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,032
If I kiss you I'll kiss anywhere.

355
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:50,327
Feeling shy?
Okay, I'll close my eyes.

356
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:55,514
C'mon kiss me quickly.

357
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,881
You want me to kiss you?

358
00:23:57,961 --> 00:24:01,802
If you don't kiss still I count three
then I'll kill you.

359
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:04,611
Pervert army-man. He's a lustful man.

360
00:24:04,691 --> 00:24:05,925
One.

361
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:07,276
Give him whatever he wants.

362
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,000
Two. Three.

363
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,677
Hey you! You kissed me?

364
00:24:15,757 --> 00:24:16,776
Your sister told me
to give you whatever you want.

365
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,115
Do you've common sense?

366
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,896
Will you jump into the fire
if she says you to do so?

367
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:22,466
Are you an idiot?
Does a man kiss another man?

368
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:24,318
I need to take bath now.
What do I do?

369
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:31,657
Can you hear me now?

370
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:36,701
Mr. Varma's call.

371
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:37,538
Hello.

372
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:39,665
Shravan, cancel the conference.

373
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:41,661
What happened, sir?
What's the problem?

374
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,670
We've report from
the intelligence department..

375
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,391
..that Mr. Gupta's life is in danger.
That's the reason.

376
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:48,558
There'll be commotion within the party
if this meeting doesn't take place.

377
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,674
The media will make our life hell.

378
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:53,578
Don't worry.
Our state is absolutely safe.

379
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,479
He'll be safe here. Okay?

380
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:58,622
Sir, please don't cancel the conference
under any circumstance.

381
00:24:58,813 --> 00:25:01,729
If you take the responsibility,
I've no problem. Okay?

382
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,450
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

383
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:08,482
And now Mr. Jagdish Shukla of
2012 batch Dehradun regiment..

384
00:25:08,562 --> 00:25:09,570
Hello.
- Hello. welcome, sir.

385
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,008
..will receive the gallantry award
from the honourable minister.

386
00:25:12,605 --> 00:25:13,585
Take a seat.

387
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,147
I'm very happy.
It's going to be great fun.

388
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,354
Hey Diya!
- Yes.

389
00:25:21,629 --> 00:25:23,338
Have you got it?
Give it to me.

390
00:25:23,418 --> 00:25:24,538
..Dehradun regiment..

391
00:25:24,618 --> 00:25:27,981
..will receive the gallantry award
from the honourable minister.

392
00:25:28,304 --> 00:25:31,185
For whom did you get this?
- It's a secret.

393
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,500
Wait for few minutes.

394
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:35,081
What's the need for this suspense?

395
00:25:35,428 --> 00:25:37,448
We're in the same regiment
for the last three years.

396
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:39,635
I'm aware of your feelings.

397
00:25:39,863 --> 00:25:41,728
Why are you being so formal
with the proposal?

398
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:43,317
You can say it here.

399
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,310
She's cooking her love story.

400
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:56,310
I wish I had worked on my body.

401
00:25:58,341 --> 00:26:02,632
Now I call Colonel Subhash,
2013 batch Ooty regiment..

402
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:05,656
..to receive the gallantry award
Keerti Chakra.

403
00:26:11,693 --> 00:26:13,772
Go.
- Kiss me first.

404
00:26:14,896 --> 00:26:18,362
Col. Subhash. Col. Subhash.

405
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:20,896
What's wrong with him?
- Where is he?

406
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:21,960
Please go.

407
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:25,605
Col. Subhash.

408
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,514
Where is he? Where did he disappear?
- Col. Subhash, please come on the stage.

409
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:09,266
Brother..
- Yes.

410
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,780
..clean your cheek, there's lipstick on it.
- Sorry.

411
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:39,386
I won't spare you.

412
00:27:40,904 --> 00:27:42,326
Subhash is coming.

413
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:45,147
Absolutely fine.

414
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:56,860

415
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,928
Hello. How are you?
- Many congratulations.

416
00:27:59,008 --> 00:27:59,753
Everything is fine.

417
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:00,374
Good morning, sir.

418
00:28:00,454 --> 00:28:01,701
I've an important information.
- Okay.

419
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:05,084
Your friend Deepak Mehta
left the country last night and escaped.

420
00:28:05,957 --> 00:28:07,188
What are you saying?
Where did he escape?

421
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:10,702
He took a loan of 4000 crores
for the government tender.

422
00:28:10,782 --> 00:28:12,853
As soon as he got the money
he left the country.

423
00:28:13,117 --> 00:28:15,902
Are you sure? Is the news confirmed?
- Yes, I'm sure. It's confirmed.

424
00:28:15,982 --> 00:28:18,699
Brother, any problem?
- Yes? No.

425
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:20,085
Commissioner, don't worry.
- Yes.

426
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,077
I'll look into this matter.

427
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,085
We'll discuss about this
after the conference. - Okay, sir.

428
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:24,256
Do something.

429
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,715
Try to contact Deepak.
- Hello.

430
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:27,794
Madam, this way. Come this way.

431
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:30,925
The arrangements are quite grand.
- Yes, it's impressive.

432
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:37,355
Hi! I've found it.

433
00:28:39,757 --> 00:28:40,701
I've found it.

434
00:28:40,781 --> 00:28:42,733
Sir, CM sir has arrived.
- Okay. He has arrived.

435
00:28:43,103 --> 00:28:44,621
Brother, please take care of things here.
I'll be back. - Okay.

436
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,510
C'mon hurry up. CM sir is here.

437
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,362
Glory to our CM.

438
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:50,310
Glory to Mr. Gupta.

439
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:54,625
Thank you.
- Welcome sir.

440
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,151
Welcome, sir.

441
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,884
Hail Mr. Gupta.

442
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:06,398
Glory to our CM.
- Glory to Mr. Gupta.

443
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,920
Glory to our CM.
- Glory to Mr. Gupta.

444
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:12,159
Sir, the phone of Deepak sir
is switched off.

445
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,924
Keep trying. It's important.
- Okay, sir.

446
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,147
Welcome everybody.

447
00:29:27,227 --> 00:29:30,051
Politicians have the bad reputation
of misusing their power..

448
00:29:30,131 --> 00:29:31,521
..to amass huge wealth.

449
00:29:31,808 --> 00:29:39,421
Once they are in power they misuse
the black money to stay in power.

450
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:43,915
My motto is to serve
my country selflessly.

451
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:49,341
When I'll retire from politics in future
I won't have a house of my own.

452
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,737
I'll shift to a small government quarter.

453
00:29:52,928 --> 00:29:57,183
I'm sure that my son, my successor
will walk on the path of truth.

454
00:29:57,263 --> 00:30:00,530
With your permission I would
request him to take the administrative..

455
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,100
..responsibility of this state.

456
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,136
Congratulation.

457
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,036
All the best.

458
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,509
Greetings. Thanks to all of you.

459
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:32,465
I'm here only because of the principles
and teachings of my father.

460
00:30:32,545 --> 00:30:36,481
I'll be dedicated to the service of the
people of my state till my last breath.

461
00:30:41,192 --> 00:30:42,136
Mira..

462
00:30:43,248 --> 00:30:44,658
Hey listen to me..

463
00:30:45,471 --> 00:30:46,511
Mira..

464
00:30:48,422 --> 00:30:50,311
I'll hit you.
- Please.

465
00:30:53,944 --> 00:30:56,561
What is it?
- Mira, Subhash is calling you.

466
00:30:59,286 --> 00:31:00,230
Check your message.

467
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:06,134
Son..
- Yes, father.

468
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:08,657
Today is a very important day for us.

469
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:10,449
What happened?
- I've forgotten my phone in the car.

470
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:11,404
I'll get it.

471
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,856
Hurry up. Sir's speech has started.
- Yes.

472
00:31:19,936 --> 00:31:22,521
It's going to be a great one.
We're going to enjoy it. Hurry up.

473
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:25,138
Madam, you?
- Actually I forgot my phone in the car.

474
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:26,644
Okay, I'll get it for you.
- No.

475
00:31:26,724 --> 00:31:28,772
I know that you're very eager
to hear brother's speech.

476
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:30,899
I'll get it.
- Okay, madam.

477
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,337
Let's go.
- They won't let me romance properly.

478
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,513
Everybody should get their due respect.

479
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,728
This is what we aim to achieve.

480
00:31:38,954 --> 00:31:39,791
Where is Mira?

481
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,596
She went to the parking to get her phone.

482
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:44,164
We aspire for the
development of our society.

483
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:48,025
Where are you going?
- To make a call. - Okay.

484
00:31:57,073 --> 00:32:00,575
Sorry, madam. Is he blind? Idiot!

485
00:32:02,852 --> 00:32:03,575
Hey!

486
00:32:06,444 --> 00:32:07,472
Why are you late?

487
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:08,870
There's police everywhere.

488
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,185
Okay, give me the phone.

489
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:13,926
How come someone is calling on
this number?

490
00:32:15,014 --> 00:32:15,683
Oh no! I'm in trouble.

491
00:32:15,763 --> 00:32:17,631
I banged with a girl on the way
and our phones got exchanged.

492
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:18,862
Do you think this is a joke?

493
00:32:18,942 --> 00:32:20,858
The number that'll cause a blast
on the stage is in that phone.

494
00:32:21,312 --> 00:32:22,654
How will the explosion take place
without the phone?

495
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,479
Go and get the phone
before the speech ends.

496
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:27,615
Look there. She's the girl.

497
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,535
Give my phone. My phone.

498
00:32:29,762 --> 00:32:30,934
Hey you!

499
00:32:33,324 --> 00:32:34,460
The police are coming.

500
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,846
Excuse me. What are you doing here?

501
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:40,447
We're from the catering service.

502
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:43,161
Nobody is allowed to stay here.
- Okay, sir.

503
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:45,850
Get in the car and leave immediately.
- okay, I'll leave.

504
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:02,225
What happened? Where is she?
- She hit me and escaped.

505
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,715
You go in that direction and
I'll go in this direction. - Okay.

506
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:50,617
Madam, what's wrong with you?

507
00:33:51,394 --> 00:33:52,971
What do you want to say?
Who is there?

508
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:04,889
Now, I request respected Mr. Gupta
to come on stage and speak few words.

509
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:11,056
Greetings to everybody.
Respected Mr. KRK..

510
00:34:17,593 --> 00:34:19,338
Where did she disappear?
- I don't know.

511
00:34:40,517 --> 00:34:41,892
Yes, sister.
- Where are you?

512
00:34:41,972 --> 00:34:43,816
Dad is looking for you.
Come here immediately.

513
00:34:44,055 --> 00:34:45,154
Did Mira reach there?

514
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:46,625
Hello. Hello.

515
00:35:29,653 --> 00:35:33,286
Madam, our phone is with her.
Don't let her go.

516
00:35:47,163 --> 00:35:50,211
Our government will give
equal facilities to all states.

517
00:35:50,438 --> 00:35:55,362
We'll try to solve the water problems
that's been going on for years.

518
00:35:55,625 --> 00:36:00,322
We've planned to set up
a new medical college here.

519
00:36:10,984 --> 00:36:11,952
Deepak, hello..

520
00:36:12,032 --> 00:36:12,825
Shravan, listen to me.

521
00:36:12,905 --> 00:36:14,176
Where are you?
- Stop asking about me.

522
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,622
Get out of there immediately. Come on.

523
00:36:16,566 --> 00:36:18,227
People are speaking ill things about you.

524
00:36:18,307 --> 00:36:19,626
Shravan, please try to understand.
Your life is in danger.

525
00:36:19,706 --> 00:36:20,522
What nonsense?

526
00:36:20,602 --> 00:36:22,554
We'll finish the terrorists.

527
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,606
You don't have time.
Get out of there. Get out.

528
00:37:24,085 --> 00:37:26,727
Look what has happened to Mr. Gupta.

529
00:37:27,265 --> 00:37:29,082
He showed faith in us.

530
00:37:29,162 --> 00:37:31,592
We were responsible for his safety.

531
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:33,217
Look what has happened?

532
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:36,803
Mr. Gupta! Mr. Gupta!

533
00:37:37,974 --> 00:37:39,468
Brother..

534
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:43,281
Subhash..

535
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,592
No!

536
00:37:57,516 --> 00:38:02,356
It's believed that politicians and not
terrorists are involved in this mishap.

537
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:03,731
Stay connected.

538
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:07,509
Hello. Hello. Yes, it's confirmed.

539
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:09,767
We've got the medical report.
He died on the spot.

540
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,715
No.. no.. they used hydro-med.

541
00:38:11,895 --> 00:38:13,735
It was fitted in the ac
and it caused the explosion.

542
00:38:13,815 --> 00:38:14,716
Okay, I'll do it.

543
00:38:17,716 --> 00:38:19,796
This incident has caused
an uproar in the entire nation.

544
00:38:20,011 --> 00:38:21,959
We've orders from the high command
that his body be taken to Delhi,.

545
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:23,059
How can we do that?
- Shut up.

546
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:25,270
He died in our state.
- I said, shut up.

547
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,417
Sir, please listen to me.

548
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:27,648
Damodar, arrange a private jet
at the airport.

549
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:30,062
Please listen to me.
- Please take him out.

550
00:38:30,397 --> 00:38:32,823
This is an insult to our state.
- Sir, please come with us.

551
00:38:33,432 --> 00:38:34,328
Please come.

552
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:35,822
What's our fault?

553
00:38:36,002 --> 00:38:37,866
Please go from here, sir.
- What happened?

554
00:38:37,946 --> 00:38:38,906
The circumstances are not favourable.

555
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:39,886
Your safety is very important.

556
00:38:39,966 --> 00:38:41,451
Get out of here immediately.
- Okay.

557
00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:42,981
What's going on?

558
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:44,738
Subhash, the circumstances
are very critical.

559
00:38:44,941 --> 00:38:46,053
Your safety is my duty.

560
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:47,619
Please don't act stubborn.
Please go from here.

561
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:49,662
Is my safety more important
than his life?

562
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:51,455
Are my party workers safe?

563
00:38:51,682 --> 00:38:53,356
Ten people died in the bomb blast.

564
00:38:53,436 --> 00:38:55,626
Besides that fifteen people
were killed in the stampede.

565
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:56,785
Where are their bodies?

566
00:38:56,865 --> 00:38:58,280
In the next block of this hospital.

567
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:00,299
Sir, we'll handle it.
- Forget it.

568
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,470
Sir..
- Sir..

569
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:04,566
What's going on?

570
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:06,718
Sister-in-law..
- Subhash, Mira hasn't reached home.

571
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:07,782
I failed to connect her on phone.

572
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:10,041
Is she with you?
- No. She is not with me.

573
00:39:10,412 --> 00:39:13,376
She must be stuck somewhere.
I'll wait for her.

574
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:19,221
We couldn't identify the deceased yet.

575
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:21,730
The officers are busy
trying to identify them.

576
00:39:22,363 --> 00:39:25,016
What happened to my husband?

577
00:39:26,403 --> 00:39:27,586
I'm ruined.

578
00:39:27,897 --> 00:39:29,379
How will I live?

579
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:36,336
Look what happened.

580
00:40:09,477 --> 00:40:10,780
Brother!

581
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,222
She was his fiancée.

582
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:23,927
Look what has happened.

583
00:41:08,593 --> 00:41:10,028
How did this happen?

584
00:41:10,108 --> 00:41:11,809
We found her body behind the stage.

585
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:13,254
She went to the parking lot
to get her phone.

586
00:41:13,334 --> 00:41:14,724
She got killed in the stampede.

587
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:17,521
As per postmortem report
she died of choking and strangulation.

588
00:41:22,171 --> 00:41:25,099
Down with him. Down.

589
00:41:25,179 --> 00:41:28,146
Down with him. Down.

590
00:41:28,226 --> 00:41:31,062
Down with him. Down.

591
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:34,289
Down with him. Down.

592
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:40,863
What's happening, son?

593
00:41:40,943 --> 00:41:41,819
I don't know.

594
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,982
Sir, we've deployed
two more units of police force.

595
00:41:44,062 --> 00:41:46,935
Please stay here with your family
till the matter settles.

596
00:41:47,015 --> 00:41:48,883
Forget it. first tell me
what's going on outside.

597
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:51,046
Nobody has the courage
to tell you directly.

598
00:41:51,392 --> 00:41:52,133
You watch it on the television.

599
00:41:52,213 --> 00:41:57,297
As per our reports the death of Mr.
Indra Gupta has led to riots everywhere.

600
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:04,625
It's being suspected that the Deputy CM
is involved in the blasts.

601
00:42:04,705 --> 00:42:06,119
It's not an assumption, it's the fact.

602
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:08,080
Deepak Mehta
and the Deputy CM are close friends.

603
00:42:08,283 --> 00:42:11,546
He helped Deepak get a loan of
4000 crores to plan this attack.

604
00:42:11,626 --> 00:42:13,673
If Deepak hadn't left the country
then he would've exposed..

605
00:42:13,753 --> 00:42:15,944
..the opposition and shut the case.

606
00:42:16,024 --> 00:42:18,586
But, what will the deputy CM gain
by killing a politician?

607
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:21,897
Death of a national leader
will garner sympathy votes for him.

608
00:42:22,088 --> 00:42:26,522
The CM doesn't want to take any risk in
the first election his son will contest.

609
00:42:26,602 --> 00:42:29,881
Do you know that m Shravan got
a call just before the blast?

610
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:32,379
The call was from nobody else
but Deepak Mehta.

611
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:34,316
It's a confirmed information.

612
00:42:34,396 --> 00:42:36,121
The CBI should be handed over
the investigation of this case.

613
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:38,547
I've proof of my innocence.

614
00:42:39,002 --> 00:42:40,293
Shravan, get out of there quickly.
Come on.

615
00:42:40,373 --> 00:42:41,919
What nonsense are you speaking?

616
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:43,604
Shravan, your life is in danger.

617
00:42:45,158 --> 00:42:47,883
Santram, arrange a press conference
in our house in the evening.

618
00:42:47,963 --> 00:42:48,624
What are you saying?

619
00:42:48,704 --> 00:42:50,333
We haven't bid farewell to
our deceased daughter yet.

620
00:42:50,413 --> 00:42:52,294
Why do you want to call for a press
conference under these circumstances?

621
00:42:52,616 --> 00:42:54,696
It's useless to douse the fire after
everything has turned into ashes.

622
00:43:00,326 --> 00:43:03,063
Sir, I'm here.
The meeting hasn't started yet.

623
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:09,780
Subhash, your brother went to his room
after announcing the press meet.

624
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,322
All the reporters are here.

625
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:13,043
We've been continuously
knocking on his door..

626
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:14,585
..but he isn't answering.

627
00:43:14,665 --> 00:43:15,793
I'm feeling sacred.

628
00:43:19,212 --> 00:43:20,897
Sir.. sir, please open the door.

629
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:23,061
Please open the door.
- Sir, open the door. - Step back.

630
00:43:23,516 --> 00:43:24,280
What happened, sister-in-law?

631
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,229
He isn't opening the door.
- Brother... brother...

632
00:43:36,843 --> 00:43:37,859
Brother!

633
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,341
The deputy CM committed suicide
in his house today.

634
00:43:54,421 --> 00:43:57,556
As per our sources the deputy CM
was involved in Mr. Gupta's murder.

635
00:44:01,942 --> 00:44:04,297
We haven't been able to solve
the conspiracy yet.

636
00:44:04,377 --> 00:44:05,850
The mystery is getting deeper with time.

637
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,679
The police is trying to
calm down the crowd.

638
00:44:11,636 --> 00:44:15,233
After this incident
all the party offices of MSC party..

639
00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:18,401
Dad..

640
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:21,389
A son carries the bier of his father.

641
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:25,477
But today a father will carry
the bier of his son.

642
00:44:28,764 --> 00:44:31,190
Subhash, the crowd
is getting out of control.

643
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,410
They can do anything.

644
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,855
Please take the body
from here immediately.

645
00:44:34,524 --> 00:44:35,815
I've a request.

646
00:44:35,895 --> 00:44:36,986
It's going to be risky to go
from the front gate..

647
00:44:37,066 --> 00:44:37,918
..so I suggest you go
through the back gate.

648
00:44:37,998 --> 00:44:39,484
What nonsense, Bharadwaj!

649
00:44:39,771 --> 00:44:40,488
Repeat it again.

650
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:42,006
I'm saying this for your safety.

651
00:44:42,086 --> 00:44:43,033
The situation is critical.

652
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,037
Please try to understand.

653
00:44:44,117 --> 00:44:47,288
Is my son a thief?
Is he a terrorist? Or is he an orphan?

654
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:49,930
Why should we take the back door?
- Please try to understand, sir.

655
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,316
They think you're the culprit.

656
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:52,833
There are thousands of people
waiting outside.

657
00:44:52,913 --> 00:44:54,423
Many of them have weapons.

658
00:44:54,794 --> 00:44:55,857
We're helpless.

659
00:44:56,096 --> 00:44:57,208
People are going out of control.

660
00:44:57,519 --> 00:44:58,343
To hell with you.

661
00:44:58,423 --> 00:44:59,359
You're useless.

662
00:44:59,439 --> 00:45:00,782
I'll call the higher authorities.

663
00:45:34,009 --> 00:45:35,993
No, sister-in-law.

664
00:45:37,857 --> 00:45:41,000
They're taking my son's dead body
as if he's an orphan.

665
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,753
He was going to begin his career.

666
00:45:58,617 --> 00:45:59,896
Bye, brother-in-law.

667
00:46:02,955 --> 00:46:05,967
Subhash, sister-in-law didn't eat anything
since the last two days.

668
00:46:06,047 --> 00:46:07,747
She's sitting quietly.

669
00:46:07,827 --> 00:46:10,150
I'm worried.
Please go and talk to her.

670
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:25,711
He was a virtuous and an honest man.

671
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,958
He never wished ill for anybody.

672
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:36,026
He was innocent like a child.

673
00:46:36,684 --> 00:46:40,365
But, the people who considered him God
started hating him in a day.

674
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:43,389
They're cursing him.

675
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:46,151
Life has become meaningless.

676
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:52,797
Don't spare the people who killed my dad.

677
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:55,247
Please make him cry
the way we're crying.

678
00:46:58,701 --> 00:46:59,538
Yes, tell me.

679
00:46:59,618 --> 00:47:03,374
Subhash, do you remember the number that
Mira wrote on her hand before she died?

680
00:47:04,653 --> 00:47:05,968
We've found that car.

681
00:47:06,048 --> 00:47:07,724
We've also found the place from
where the car was bought.

682
00:47:07,804 --> 00:47:08,884
Come fast here.

683
00:47:11,824 --> 00:47:14,071
Punish him, uncle.

684
00:47:20,202 --> 00:47:23,190
Two days back a lay and two men
bought a van from here.

685
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,780
The documents provided by them are fake.

686
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,051
None of the CCTV cameras
installed here is working.

687
00:47:27,131 --> 00:47:29,549
We've got a small footage of the exit.

688
00:47:29,629 --> 00:47:31,425
But, their faces are not clear.

689
00:47:31,505 --> 00:47:33,923
Sir, pause and rewind.

690
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:37,138
Stop. Zoom the image.

691
00:47:43,137 --> 00:47:44,464
I've seen this somewhere.

692
00:47:49,686 --> 00:47:52,602
Bharat, I've seen her at home
on the day brother died.

693
00:47:52,682 --> 00:47:53,427
Who can she be?

694
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:56,057
Besides your relatives
the party workers were present there.

695
00:47:56,137 --> 00:47:59,344
The only unknown people present there
were from media and press.

696
00:48:01,734 --> 00:48:04,220
As far as I remember
everybody signed before entry.

697
00:48:05,248 --> 00:48:07,949
Look there. Look carefully.
She's the one.

698
00:48:08,331 --> 00:48:12,503
She came inside,
but didn't sit with the other journalists.

699
00:48:15,228 --> 00:48:17,534
After brother committed suicide
everybody left.

700
00:48:21,718 --> 00:48:24,180
She came out from inside
and merged with the crowd.

701
00:48:25,745 --> 00:48:28,614
She came with everybody
and left with them.

702
00:48:28,694 --> 00:48:30,562
But, she was missing
for around fifteen minutes..

703
00:48:30,957 --> 00:48:32,367
..exactly at the same time
when my brother died.

704
00:48:32,547 --> 00:48:38,260
This girl is the common factor in the
deaths of Mr. Gupta, Mira and brother.

705
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,280
She came in as a part time
photographer with Malti..

706
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,930
..a top news channel reporter.

707
00:48:42,683 --> 00:48:45,037
If we get Malti we'll get her too.

708
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:49,675
Sir, we went to the news channel's office
and enquired about Malti.

709
00:48:49,755 --> 00:48:50,643
Malti hasn't come to office
since the past two days.

710
00:48:50,723 --> 00:48:51,993
She is not going to office. But why?

711
00:48:52,073 --> 00:48:53,177
We haven't found the reason yet, sir.

712
00:48:55,029 --> 00:48:58,041
She went to attend your
brother's press conference.

713
00:48:58,387 --> 00:49:00,300
But, it was her dead body
that came home.

714
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,089
Her scooter was knocked down by a truck.

715
00:49:04,169 --> 00:49:07,125
Did we raise her for this day?

716
00:49:07,663 --> 00:49:11,045
Brother, does she have a friend
who has a tattoo on her neck?

717
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:12,874
The girl with a tattoo on her neck?
- Yes.

718
00:49:12,954 --> 00:49:14,488
She befriended her
a couple of days back.

719
00:49:14,568 --> 00:49:15,659
She was very sweet.

720
00:49:15,739 --> 00:49:19,615
She went as a photographer
with Malti the day your brother died.

721
00:49:19,695 --> 00:49:21,659
But, she never came back after that day.

722
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:25,495
Brother, can we get your daughter's
diary and phone?

723
00:49:25,575 --> 00:49:28,077
Malti didn't write diary.

724
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:30,837
Her phone broke
the day she met with the accident.

725
00:49:32,044 --> 00:49:35,259
Subhash, this phone is
our last hope in this investigation.

726
00:49:44,832 --> 00:49:47,916
She's very smart.
She has already formatted the phone.

727
00:49:47,996 --> 00:49:49,326
There's no information in it.

728
00:49:49,517 --> 00:49:50,473
I knew it.

729
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:52,469
There's always backup in Google drive.

730
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:54,047
Try from her email.
- Okay.

731
00:50:00,404 --> 00:50:03,357
Yes! We've got the backup files.
- Copy them.

732
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:10,635
What?

733
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:19,254
Oh no! This girl is very smart.
She's a step ahead of us.

734
00:50:19,334 --> 00:50:21,011
She's hacking all the data.

735
00:50:21,091 --> 00:50:23,377
She deleted the later files at first.

736
00:50:23,736 --> 00:50:26,533
It'll be difficult to trace her.
- But, we'll definitely find her.

737
00:50:26,613 --> 00:50:28,900
Try to trace her user location.
- Sure.

738
00:50:33,788 --> 00:50:35,234
Mexico. It means she's there.

739
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:37,684
Iran.

740
00:50:39,106 --> 00:50:40,182
Indonesia.

741
00:50:41,234 --> 00:50:42,107
London.

742
00:50:42,717 --> 00:50:43,661
Sri Lanka.

743
00:50:43,912 --> 00:50:45,107
Five locations at the same time.

744
00:50:45,187 --> 00:50:46,063
She's brilliant.

745
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,669
She's using a proxy server to confuse us.

746
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:51,048
Only one out of these five locations
is the correct one.

747
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,055
But, it's difficult to say
which one is her actual location.

748
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:53,784
London.

749
00:50:56,449 --> 00:50:57,453
How do you know?

750
00:50:57,681 --> 00:50:59,558
Do you remember the footage
on which she was signing the register?

751
00:50:59,638 --> 00:51:01,362
I saw her phone in the footage.

752
00:51:01,442 --> 00:51:02,784
There were two time zones on that phone.

753
00:51:02,864 --> 00:51:04,470
The time difference
was of four and half hours.

754
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:06,764
Among all these five locations
the location which has a time difference..

755
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:08,761
..of four and half hours is London.

756
00:51:09,526 --> 00:51:11,617
Check the lists and find all
the passengers who travelled to London..

757
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:13,159
..on the day my brother died.

758
00:51:13,482 --> 00:51:14,772
We'll find her on the list.

759
00:51:14,976 --> 00:51:17,856
Sir, the girl left for London that day
on British Airways.

760
00:51:18,048 --> 00:51:19,901
All her details are here in this file.

761
00:51:20,546 --> 00:51:22,757
Her name is Kayra.
She's a professional killer.

762
00:51:22,837 --> 00:51:24,681
The most wanted criminal by the Interpol.

763
00:51:24,761 --> 00:51:27,084
As per our information
she's based in London.

764
00:51:27,164 --> 00:51:30,442
But, we've neither found her address
nor her next target.

765
00:51:32,665 --> 00:51:33,920
Now she's my target.

766
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,952
How will you find her without any clue?

767
00:51:36,143 --> 00:51:38,211
Her passport is also fake.

768
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:40,218
It's obvious that the address mentioned
in it is also fake.

769
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:41,486
How will you trace her?

770
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,259
I've no option.

771
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:45,837
The absconding can escape
anywhere in the world..

772
00:51:45,917 --> 00:51:47,498
..but the person chasing
has only one way.

773
00:52:25,171 --> 00:52:26,092
Move.

774
00:53:01,204 --> 00:53:03,296
You've arrived at your destination.

775
00:53:37,503 --> 00:53:40,957
Who placed the electric pole here?
He looks like a human.

776
00:53:41,037 --> 00:53:44,256
Yes? What do you want?
- Kayra?

777
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,818
18-12-79, Down Street. Correct?

778
00:53:47,898 --> 00:53:50,603
The address is right but the girl
you're looking for doesn't reside here.

779
00:53:50,683 --> 00:53:52,001
Are you an Indian?
- Why?

780
00:53:52,181 --> 00:53:53,723
Didn't you hear the language
I just spoke in?

781
00:53:53,803 --> 00:53:55,947
I'm a pure Indian. From Mumbai.

782
00:53:56,027 --> 00:53:58,895
What's the problem?
- Somebody gave me this address.

783
00:53:58,975 --> 00:54:00,389
Don't look at her, she's an old lady.

784
00:54:00,469 --> 00:54:01,680
Close the door, old man.

785
00:54:02,277 --> 00:54:05,014
Please listen to me.
Can you help me find her?

786
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,986
I swear on God that
I don't know the girl.

787
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,993
Four people had come before you
to enquire about the girl.

788
00:54:09,073 --> 00:54:11,109
But, I don't know what went wrong.
All four of them died.

789
00:54:11,189 --> 00:54:12,591
But, you seem to be from a decent family.

790
00:54:12,671 --> 00:54:14,229
I suggest that
you book your return tickets and leave.

791
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:15,759
If you jump you'll reach India.

792
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,022
You're an Indian.
Wouldn't you like to help me?

793
00:54:19,102 --> 00:54:21,054
Do you want me to leave my job
for the girl?

794
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:23,719
I can offer you coffee on the way.
But, you've to pay the bill.

795
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:25,034
There's nothing in the bedroom.
Let's go.

796
00:54:27,784 --> 00:54:30,138
Let me introduce myself. I'm Subhash.
- I know.

797
00:54:30,377 --> 00:54:31,740
You're a colonel in the Indian army.

798
00:54:32,552 --> 00:54:34,811
2013 batch. Ooty regiment.

799
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:37,058
Your phone number is 9444131157.

800
00:54:37,138 --> 00:54:39,425
You've an account in Dehradun's
Kendriya bank. You're from Valli.

801
00:54:39,505 --> 00:54:40,895
Your dad is the CM of Tamil Nadu.

802
00:54:40,975 --> 00:54:42,305
Is that enough or shall I tell you
what's in your horoscope?

803
00:54:42,385 --> 00:54:45,891
How do you know so much?
- It's my job to find details of people.

804
00:54:46,106 --> 00:54:47,636
I'm a professional hacker.

805
00:54:48,174 --> 00:54:51,341
You don't look like one.
- Why? Does a hacker look special?

806
00:54:51,544 --> 00:54:52,695
You look like a comedian.

807
00:54:52,775 --> 00:54:55,345
This is the reason
why I don't help people.

808
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,325
The doorbell of my house
has a fingerprint scanner.

809
00:54:59,405 --> 00:55:02,360
As soon as you rang the bell
I got your history.

810
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,281
Do you get it now?

811
00:55:03,496 --> 00:55:06,018
So, it must be very easy
for you to trace a girl.

812
00:55:06,098 --> 00:55:07,608
It's not as easy as you think it to be.

813
00:55:07,688 --> 00:55:10,118
If you want to catch a shark
then you need bait.

814
00:55:10,198 --> 00:55:11,935
We need data. Got it?

815
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,613
There's a flight to India in the evening.
Leave.

816
00:55:14,983 --> 00:55:15,987
What happened? Got fever?

817
00:55:16,871 --> 00:55:19,047
Do you remember the old couple
who lives next to your flat?

818
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:20,911
They're my landlords.
What do you want from them?

819
00:55:21,664 --> 00:55:22,823
I need their phone number.

820
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:24,222
So, your preferences
have changed drastically. Huh?

821
00:55:24,302 --> 00:55:27,067
When I rang your doorbell its
they who opened the door before you.

822
00:55:27,413 --> 00:55:28,919
They're an old couple.

823
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:30,556
If they were based in India
they would be busy watching TV soaps.

824
00:55:30,636 --> 00:55:33,317
They don't get that here,
so they were looking for gossip material.

825
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:36,185
I saw a tattoo design
which was also on the girl's neck.

826
00:55:41,253 --> 00:55:42,675
Kayra killed many people.

827
00:55:42,854 --> 00:55:44,827
I'm sure the old couple
has links with her.

828
00:55:44,907 --> 00:55:45,735
What can I do?

829
00:55:45,815 --> 00:55:47,635
If we get their phone number
then you can trace the calls..

830
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:48,938
..made by them in the last half an hour.

831
00:55:49,018 --> 00:55:51,065
It's a small job but
I need good payment for it. Okay?

832
00:55:51,145 --> 00:55:52,081
Don't stare at me.

833
00:55:52,161 --> 00:55:54,675
If you pay then I'll switch on my laptop
or I've lot of work.

834
00:55:55,511 --> 00:55:56,623
Done. Just do it.

835
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:05,563
Soldier, they made only one outgoing call
in the last half an hour.

836
00:56:05,643 --> 00:56:06,806
I've messaged you the number.
Check it.

837
00:56:08,336 --> 00:56:11,013
I got a message that 50,000
has been debited from my account.

838
00:56:11,093 --> 00:56:12,424
Don't worry, I took the money.

839
00:56:12,504 --> 00:56:14,838
It's my fees
which I've already taken from you.

840
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:16,464
What if you betray me later?

841
00:56:16,544 --> 00:56:18,316
You've got the message
with the phone number.

842
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:26,239
I've got a call from that same number.

843
00:56:28,546 --> 00:56:29,646
Hello.

844
00:56:34,344 --> 00:56:36,304
Listen to me. Give him the phone.

845
00:56:36,384 --> 00:56:37,977
Why? Don't you like my voice?

846
00:56:38,057 --> 00:56:39,734
Idiot, just give it to him.

847
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:41,695
Brainless loser. Do as I say.

848
00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:43,260
She wants to talk to you.
Speak with her.

849
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:48,890
Hello Kayra.

850
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:52,918
You've come to London to avenge
the deaths in your family. Huh?

851
00:56:53,145 --> 00:56:56,169
Political power. Police power.
You had everything..

852
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,169
..yet I easily went there
and killed them.

853
00:56:59,408 --> 00:57:00,568
This is my area.

854
00:57:00,747 --> 00:57:02,635
Killing you'll be a cakewalk for me.

855
00:57:02,715 --> 00:57:04,428
Stop acting smart and leave.

856
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:05,468
Where will I get Deepak Mehta?

857
00:57:05,548 --> 00:57:09,437
Deepak Mehta betrayed you
but I won't betray him.

858
00:57:09,517 --> 00:57:10,991
I've already traced your number.

859
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,425
So, it won't be difficult to trace you.

860
00:57:12,604 --> 00:57:14,218
You mean call tracking. Idiot!

861
00:57:14,493 --> 00:57:17,254
I'll take out the sim card and destroy it.
Who will you follow after that?

862
00:57:17,588 --> 00:57:21,497
If you want you can search every lane and
alley in London for the next ten years.

863
00:57:21,712 --> 00:57:22,943
It's impossible to trace me.

864
00:57:23,122 --> 00:57:25,429
You can destroy your sim card and
escape anywhere as you're scared of me.

865
00:57:25,883 --> 00:57:27,162
But, I'm not scared.

866
00:57:27,425 --> 00:57:30,497
9444131157. This is my number.

867
00:57:30,855 --> 00:57:32,457
I'll wait for you at
the Trafalgar Square tomorrow.

868
00:57:32,537 --> 00:57:34,321
I'll be in a red t-shirt. Spot me.

869
00:57:34,401 --> 00:57:36,497
I've no power except will power.

870
00:57:36,843 --> 00:57:38,612
You're confident that
you're in your territory now.

871
00:57:38,947 --> 00:57:40,178
Come and meet me.

872
00:57:41,051 --> 00:57:41,923
Okay. Let's see.

873
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:44,935
What did she say?

874
00:57:45,015 --> 00:57:46,907
She threatened that
she'll kill all my team members.

875
00:57:47,983 --> 00:57:49,166
I'm the one in your team.

876
00:57:49,441 --> 00:57:51,557
This is a serious punishment
for hacking an old woman's number.

877
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:55,059
Brother, it's your responsibility
to save my life.

878
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,007
There's only one solution.
- Share it quickly.

879
00:57:57,087 --> 00:57:57,892
I haven't got the idea yet.

880
00:57:58,071 --> 00:57:59,828
You've landed me in trouble
and you don't even have an idea.

881
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:01,693
I was spanked by lady teachers
in childhood.

882
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:03,115
And even now a woman is after my life.

883
00:58:15,688 --> 00:58:17,134
Take it, bro. You too.

884
00:58:17,214 --> 00:58:18,544
Take it.

885
00:58:18,843 --> 00:58:21,963
Listen! I remember all your faces.
Wear them and stay here.

886
00:58:22,043 --> 00:58:24,293
Anybody who doesn't wear
this will be thrashed badly.

887
00:58:24,373 --> 00:58:25,775
Take it. Take it quickly.

888
00:58:25,855 --> 00:58:28,034
This is only for men.
I request the women not to crowd here.

889
00:58:28,114 --> 00:58:30,640
Subhash, I've distributed
the t-shirts to everybody.

890
00:58:30,855 --> 00:58:32,660
I always thought that Indians are greedy
for free goodies..

891
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,344
..but, these foreigners
are smarter than us.

892
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:35,731
They snatched away the t-shirts from me.

893
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:37,057
Stop discussing these foreigners now.

894
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,487
Quietly donate the two t-shirts
you've kept for yourself.

895
00:58:41,539 --> 00:58:42,902
How did he know?

896
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:44,873
This is the advantage of being tall.

897
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,212
I've taken out the two t-shirts.

898
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:47,562
What do I do now?

899
00:58:47,642 --> 00:58:49,403
Give it to somebody and wait there.
I'll go there.

900
00:58:49,483 --> 00:58:50,383
Go.

901
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:57,697
Red t-shirt.

902
00:59:11,694 --> 00:59:13,642
Chief, many people are in red t-shirts.

903
00:59:13,821 --> 00:59:15,208
But, I can't spot him.

904
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:19,559
You fool, he is around.
Keep everybody in conference mode.

905
00:59:19,762 --> 00:59:23,587
I'll track him and then
I'll connect with you and guide you.

906
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:24,830
Yes, chief. Move it. Move it.

907
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:25,882
Okay.
- Copy.

908
00:59:31,631 --> 00:59:32,838
Jack..
- Yes.

909
00:59:33,077 --> 00:59:34,344
I knew that she wouldn't come.

910
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:35,504
What do I do?

911
00:59:35,584 --> 00:59:37,655
Many people here are using
their cell phones.

912
00:59:38,193 --> 00:59:40,368
Can you find out the source of
their conference call?

913
00:59:40,448 --> 00:59:42,340
Hello I'm one and only Jack.

914
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,822
I'm an expert at cracking server codes.

915
00:59:43,902 --> 00:59:45,759
This is the reason why
my friends call me Crack Jack.

916
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,372
How can you doubt my ability?

917
00:59:47,587 --> 00:59:49,344
I'll find everything in two minutes.
Just wait and watch.

918
01:00:18,555 --> 01:00:21,065
On your right.
200 meters away from you.

919
01:00:21,145 --> 01:00:23,001
Okay. Guys, right.

920
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,687
Hello Subhash, four conference calls
are active here.

921
01:00:33,865 --> 01:00:36,961
One is a service provider
and ten people are connected to it.

922
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:37,917
It seems to be some company meeting.

923
01:00:37,997 --> 01:00:38,909
Next.

924
01:00:40,116 --> 01:00:42,877
Oh God! A woman is playing with three men.

925
01:00:42,957 --> 01:00:43,738
Share the location with me.

926
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:45,710
It's right in front of me.
But it's useless for you.

927
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:46,977
Shall I try to mingle with them?
- What?

928
01:00:47,156 --> 01:00:48,913
I'll try to gel in with the three guys.

929
01:00:50,825 --> 01:00:51,925
We're in a serious matter.

930
01:00:52,005 --> 01:00:54,626
This isn't the tome to joke.
- You're so selfish.

931
01:00:54,706 --> 01:00:55,750
Please think about this poor fellow.

932
01:00:55,929 --> 01:00:58,977
You didn't get one girl
but I never got any girl in my life.

933
01:01:02,156 --> 01:01:03,256
You're near him.

934
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:09,364
Go 70 meters to your right.

935
01:01:09,444 --> 01:01:10,678
This way. Move.

936
01:01:21,387 --> 01:01:23,718
Done?
- Just a second.

937
01:01:24,041 --> 01:01:25,415
These people are on the call
for a long time.

938
01:01:25,905 --> 01:01:27,064
One number is quite familiar.

939
01:01:27,144 --> 01:01:28,858
Who are you busy talking
to instead of working?

940
01:01:28,938 --> 01:01:32,623
I'll slap you hard, fatso.
- Sorry, bro. It's a mistake.

941
01:01:34,045 --> 01:01:35,611
You're very close to him. 40 meters.

942
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:36,866
One more conference call is on.

943
01:01:37,057 --> 01:01:37,965
I think it's an important.

944
01:01:38,045 --> 01:01:39,124
It would've been great
if I could hear them.

945
01:01:39,204 --> 01:01:41,288
Six men are talking to one woman.

946
01:01:41,368 --> 01:01:42,698
Five of them are close to us.

947
01:01:42,778 --> 01:01:44,014
Only one is in some other corner.

948
01:01:44,193 --> 01:01:45,352
That's her. She's the one.

949
01:01:45,432 --> 01:01:46,225
Share her location.

950
01:01:46,305 --> 01:01:48,137
Wait, give me a couple of minutes.

951
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:50,432
You're only 20 meters from him.
Go straight.

952
01:01:56,994 --> 01:01:57,771
Have you fallen asleep?

953
01:01:57,851 --> 01:01:59,277
10 seconds more.
Let the internet do its work.

954
01:01:59,357 --> 01:02:00,353
C'mon hurry up.

955
01:02:00,433 --> 01:02:01,871
Why are you shouting at me?

956
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:03,568
Let Google do its job.

957
01:02:04,499 --> 01:02:05,432
Found her.

958
01:02:09,448 --> 01:02:12,317
There's a famous Victoria Hall
200 meters to your right.

959
01:02:12,397 --> 01:02:13,799
She's over there.
Do what you want to.

960
01:02:13,879 --> 01:02:15,616
Thanks, Jack.
- Where is he going?

961
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:16,668
Hey Tall fellow!

962
01:02:18,975 --> 01:02:20,756
Is it a cheap phone that he left it here?

963
01:02:21,306 --> 01:02:22,585
Chief, we didn't find him.

964
01:02:22,665 --> 01:02:24,581
Three meters to your left.

965
01:02:29,552 --> 01:02:30,652
We've found the target.

966
01:02:38,826 --> 01:02:39,579
Yes, friend.

967
01:02:39,659 --> 01:02:41,121
Why are you hacking the numbers?

968
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:43,845
Idiot! I'm doing my job.
- Hey you!

969
01:02:44,502 --> 01:02:46,749
What are you doing?
Why are you hitting me?

970
01:03:06,087 --> 01:03:08,346
Don't hit me.
- Yes, Chief.

971
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:11,622
Idiots, you got the wrong man.
He's here.

972
01:03:13,403 --> 01:03:14,251
Come here quickly.

973
01:03:14,331 --> 01:03:15,231
Guys, let's go.

974
01:03:20,849 --> 01:03:23,813
You've turned a hacker into a joker.

975
01:03:24,374 --> 01:03:27,268
Mr. Subhash, well-done.

976
01:03:27,476 --> 01:03:29,192
This is a great way to express gratitude.

977
01:03:29,335 --> 01:03:30,579
I'm so glad.

978
01:07:40,037 --> 01:07:41,089
Chief, catch.

979
01:10:36,318 --> 01:10:37,519
He won't come to save you.

980
01:10:37,599 --> 01:10:39,230
So, you too don't try to save him.

981
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,022
C'mon tell me where Deepak is.

982
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,824
You can torture me and even kill me
but I'm not going to share anything.

983
01:10:43,904 --> 01:10:45,900
I also follow certain principles.
- Principles?

984
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,660
How can a contract killer
talk about principles?

985
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:49,899
I will..

986
01:10:54,485 --> 01:10:56,630
There's a message from your bank.

987
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:59,950
You're going to die in five
minutes and somebody has paid you..

988
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:02,253
..5 million dollars for your next target.

989
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:05,263
It's not for anybody else,
it's my advance payment to kill you.

990
01:11:06,073 --> 01:11:07,740
It's a huge network.

991
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:11,497
If I fail to kill you there are
other people who'll be hired to kill you.

992
01:11:11,577 --> 01:11:12,501
Its better you go back.

993
01:11:12,581 --> 01:11:13,850
You may not get this chance again.

994
01:11:14,044 --> 01:11:16,888
I'll definitely go back
but after I find Deepak.

995
01:11:17,911 --> 01:11:18,928
This is not a game.

996
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:21,911
How will you find him without my help?
- I don't need your help.

997
01:11:22,143 --> 01:11:22,987
Your phone is sufficient.

998
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:58,287
Who are you? What are you doing here?

999
01:12:08,484 --> 01:12:10,629
Subhash, please help me.

1000
01:12:11,537 --> 01:12:14,512
Please help me.
- Follow your principles.

1001
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,915
I know where you'll find him.
Please save me.

1002
01:12:41,929 --> 01:12:43,616
Listen. Stamp her and kill her.

1003
01:12:43,696 --> 01:12:46,781
It should appear that she got killed
in the stampede after the blast.

1004
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:23,746
Note down my order.

1005
01:13:23,826 --> 01:13:25,796
A scorpion soup with a snake rice.

1006
01:13:25,876 --> 01:13:26,585
Pack the food.

1007
01:13:26,665 --> 01:13:28,765
I'll send somebody
to hell and come to get it.

1008
01:13:28,845 --> 01:13:31,096
Why didn't you come inside to receive me?

1009
01:13:31,176 --> 01:13:33,096
I've come to see you
off and not receive you.

1010
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:34,314
Are you joking?
- What else?

1011
01:13:34,394 --> 01:13:36,839
Mira and elder brother
died because of you.

1012
01:13:36,919 --> 01:13:38,174
You've come here to take revenge.

1013
01:13:38,254 --> 01:13:39,585
I'm not going to accompany you. Get lost.

1014
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:40,816
Please listen..
- Subhash..

1015
01:13:42,823 --> 01:13:43,736
Hi Subhash!

1016
01:13:43,816 --> 01:13:46,393
Did she come here for vacation?
- She refused her promotion offer.

1017
01:13:46,614 --> 01:13:48,689
She applied for a post in
foreign affairs and came to Turkey.

1018
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,765
I don't know why she did this.
- But, I know.

1019
01:13:50,845 --> 01:13:52,169
Forget all this.

1020
01:13:52,249 --> 01:13:54,155
I needed a break and so I came here.

1021
01:13:54,235 --> 01:13:56,597
But, he was saying something.
- Nothing.

1022
01:13:56,677 --> 01:14:00,250
When a person makes castles in the air
and thinks it's not nice..

1023
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:02,519
..it causes heartbreak
and to mend the heart..

1024
01:14:03,301 --> 01:14:05,148
So, what's your plan?
- I'll tell you.

1025
01:14:05,228 --> 01:14:07,037
Has he come here to
take revenge or to romance.

1026
01:14:07,117 --> 01:14:08,394
Brother-in-law, listen to me.

1027
01:14:13,957 --> 01:14:18,855
The bank which transferred money
to Kayra to kill me is in Istanbul.

1028
01:14:18,935 --> 01:14:20,764
Do you know whose account it is?
- No idea.

1029
01:14:20,844 --> 01:14:21,801
Deepak Mehta's account.

1030
01:14:21,881 --> 01:14:23,122
What?
- Yeah.

1031
01:14:23,454 --> 01:14:25,979
We need to find his address
from his bank account details.

1032
01:14:26,059 --> 01:14:28,948
Brother-in-law, you'll turn into a turkey
looking for a address in Turkey.

1033
01:14:29,028 --> 01:14:31,238
You won't get any
address from the account.

1034
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,152
No chance. Enjoy your vacation
and go back to your country.

1035
01:14:34,232 --> 01:14:38,047
Hey! You always talk shit. I will..
- He's gone crazy.

1036
01:14:38,248 --> 01:14:41,355
Our work will become easier
if we seek the government's help.

1037
01:14:41,874 --> 01:14:43,624
We can't trust anybody right now.

1038
01:14:43,784 --> 01:14:46,711
I tried to hack his
account to get the details.

1039
01:14:46,967 --> 01:14:47,956
But, I failed.

1040
01:14:48,036 --> 01:14:50,136
The bank's system is protected
with a strong firewall.

1041
01:14:50,216 --> 01:14:52,100
The passwords automatically keep changing.

1042
01:14:52,349 --> 01:14:54,750
The security is tight.
It's impossible to infiltrate.

1043
01:14:54,902 --> 01:14:58,036
Awesome! My account is in the same bank.

1044
01:14:58,116 --> 01:15:00,278
It means my money and I are safe.

1045
01:15:00,358 --> 01:15:01,330
Coffee for you.

1046
01:15:02,263 --> 01:15:03,806
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

1047
01:15:03,886 --> 01:15:05,902
Brother-in-law, why do you always hit me?

1048
01:15:05,982 --> 01:15:07,466
I was praising the bank's system.

1049
01:15:07,546 --> 01:15:09,645
Is this the way you behave
with your sister's husband?

1050
01:15:09,725 --> 01:15:11,942
Can you do anything just
because you're in the army?

1051
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:22,569
Here's the bank's blue print.
- Okay.

1052
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:25,573
What are you going to do in Turkey?
How will you get the address?

1053
01:15:27,074 --> 01:15:29,841
Customer details are encrypted
in the bank's main server.

1054
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:32,332
We can copy them only
from the server room.

1055
01:15:34,803 --> 01:15:35,913
As per the bank's blue print..

1056
01:15:35,993 --> 01:15:37,965
..there's a basement to the left
of the bank's basement.

1057
01:15:38,045 --> 01:15:38,782
Is the server room located there?

1058
01:15:38,862 --> 01:15:41,376
I surveyed the bank.
It's a highly secured bank.

1059
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:45,741
Especially the server room.

1060
01:15:45,821 --> 01:15:47,630
Only the security head
has the access to the room.

1061
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,511
You can't enter without an access card.

1062
01:15:49,591 --> 01:15:50,327
Entry is very strict.

1063
01:15:50,407 --> 01:15:52,838
You can chop off his hands 
but won't get the card.

1064
01:15:52,918 --> 01:15:54,734
The lunch time is from 1- 1:30.

1065
01:15:54,814 --> 01:15:56,470
He goes to the same restaurant every day.

1066
01:15:57,813 --> 01:15:59,646
This means that his lunch
time and venue is fixed.

1067
01:15:59,798 --> 01:16:01,472
It's a confirmed information.

1068
01:16:02,247 --> 01:16:07,402
So, we can go to the server room
when the security head goes for lunch.

1069
01:16:07,482 --> 01:16:08,744
Don't get so excited.

1070
01:16:08,824 --> 01:16:12,750
The account we want to access
should be active or it won't help.

1071
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:15,276
There's one more option.
Let's call Deepak Mehta.

1072
01:16:15,356 --> 01:16:19,317
We'll tell him to keep his account
active and we'll access the detail.

1073
01:16:19,397 --> 01:16:21,358
Do you understand now that
there are loopholes in your plan?

1074
01:16:21,438 --> 01:16:23,295
We're planning to take
out the details from a bank.

1075
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:25,343
This is not a child's play.
Keep that in mind.

1076
01:16:25,423 --> 01:16:27,356
He finds all our ideas useless.

1077
01:16:27,639 --> 01:16:28,871
You suggest something.

1078
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:31,680
I'm a talkative fellow.
I can't help with any idea.

1079
01:16:33,909 --> 01:16:34,725
Very good idea.

1080
01:16:35,009 --> 01:16:37,853
The manager has a special
password for every account.

1081
01:16:37,933 --> 01:16:40,585
Use your talkative nature
to keep the bank manager busy..

1082
01:16:40,665 --> 01:16:42,460
..and make him blurt out
the password of Deepak Mehta.

1083
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:44,183
I'll handle the rest.
- You'll handle it?

1084
01:16:44,263 --> 01:16:47,283
If I make any mistake then
remember that it's not India..

1085
01:16:47,363 --> 01:16:49,497
..that you bribe anybody
and get your job done.

1086
01:16:49,577 --> 01:16:51,226
This is Istanbul, you'll go missing.

1087
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:52,430
To hell with your idea.
- Stop!

1088
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:54,278
You're ruining my reputation here.
- Listen to me.

1089
01:16:54,358 --> 01:16:58,177
My sister told me that my brother-in-law
is brave and intelligent.

1090
01:16:58,257 --> 01:17:00,827
She also said that he's
the only one who could help me.

1091
01:17:00,973 --> 01:17:02,530
Did she really say so?

1092
01:17:03,699 --> 01:17:05,104
You heard it right.

1093
01:17:05,379 --> 01:17:07,967
My wife is devoted to her husband.

1094
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,164
I won't spare him.

1095
01:17:09,244 --> 01:17:12,187
Now that your sister has said
it there's no question of going back.

1096
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,498
Let's go and handle the bank manager.
- Let's go.

1097
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:16,255
Wait and watch what I do.

1098
01:17:21,622 --> 01:17:25,766
Soldier, if you hear any mishap
happening inside you'll know that it's me.

1099
01:17:25,846 --> 01:17:30,769
Tell your sister that
I'm on a mission today. Jai Hind.

1100
01:18:05,571 --> 01:18:07,218
What happened? Are you okay?

1101
01:18:24,446 --> 01:18:27,511
Excuse me, sir. Rajesh Malhotra.

1102
01:18:27,591 --> 01:18:28,439
Are you an Indian?

1103
01:18:28,519 --> 01:18:30,784
Yes. I've been working here 
for the last ten years.

1104
01:18:30,864 --> 01:18:32,860
I'll soon find out if you've
been here for ten days or ten years.

1105
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:36,562
I need your help.
I need to confirm a payment transfer.

1106
01:18:36,642 --> 01:18:38,749
Why did you come to me?
You could've done it online.

1107
01:18:38,829 --> 01:18:41,019
I know, sir.
Did you see the speed of the internet?

1108
01:18:41,099 --> 01:18:43,330
You've to wait whenever
you need to download anything.

1109
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:45,238
Last night I saw 'Gulabi Jawani'.

1110
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:49,597
A plumber comes to repair the taps and the
auntie at home takes him to the bathroom.

1111
01:18:49,677 --> 01:18:50,601
That's all I saw.

1112
01:18:50,681 --> 01:18:52,905
The film stopped at the climax.
- Okay. Okay.

1113
01:18:52,985 --> 01:18:56,932
Tell me the account number.
- 75432257.

1114
01:19:26,196 --> 01:19:28,202
Subhash, tell him to hurry up.

1115
01:19:28,282 --> 01:19:29,877
I don't like the orders.
- When did I order you?

1116
01:19:29,957 --> 01:19:32,014
I'm not talking to you.
Has the money come to the account?

1117
01:19:32,094 --> 01:19:34,270
There has been no transaction
in this account recently.

1118
01:19:34,623 --> 01:19:36,374
Sir, please check it properly.

1119
01:19:36,454 --> 01:19:38,249
The person who sent the money
is from India. - So?

1120
01:19:38,449 --> 01:19:39,743
Does anybody lie in India?

1121
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:41,244
Stop your nonsense.

1122
01:19:41,324 --> 01:19:42,711
It's not time for patriotism.
Concentrate on your job.

1123
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:44,067
Make him open Deepak Mehta's account.

1124
01:19:45,672 --> 01:19:46,717
Sir, please don't mind my words.

1125
01:19:46,797 --> 01:19:48,059
I can tell you his account number.

1126
01:19:48,149 --> 01:19:49,499
Please check if he
has transferred the amount.

1127
01:19:49,579 --> 01:19:51,830
We can't share any details without
the permission of the account holder.

1128
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:54,537
Would Dharmendra become a super-star if
he sought permission before he left home?

1129
01:19:54,617 --> 01:19:57,083
Would Vijay Kali be involved in a scam
if he took the bank's permission?

1130
01:19:57,163 --> 01:19:59,082
Who's Vijay Kali?
- He's Mallya now.

1131
01:19:59,162 --> 01:20:03,325
Oh please! Give me his number.
- 79573299

1132
01:20:14,039 --> 01:20:14,924
I've got access.

1133
01:20:15,865 --> 01:20:17,886
No amount was transferred
from this account recently.

1134
01:20:18,115 --> 01:20:19,547
Keep the account window open.

1135
01:20:19,627 --> 01:20:22,052
Do anything you can, but he shouldn't
log out before ten minutes. Idiot.

1136
01:20:22,132 --> 01:20:23,616
What? Whom did you call an idiot?

1137
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:25,850
What?
- I'm the idiot. It's me.

1138
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:28,223
This is going to happen
if I trust somebody.

1139
01:20:28,818 --> 01:20:30,720
Subhash, how long will it take?

1140
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,654
Ten minutes.

1141
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:32,921
Okay.

1142
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:35,710
This is a high value account.

1143
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:37,232
The account holder is an important person.

1144
01:20:37,312 --> 01:20:39,487
Are you sure that you were going
to get your payment from this account?

1145
01:20:39,991 --> 01:20:40,787
He's a strange man.

1146
01:20:40,867 --> 01:20:42,897
In the past he used to borrow money
from me to buy snacks.

1147
01:20:42,977 --> 01:20:45,201
What are you doing?

1148
01:20:45,281 --> 01:20:47,775
Ten minutes is enough
to make a short film.

1149
01:20:48,066 --> 01:20:51,664
Talking isn't as easy as hacking.
Please hurry up.

1150
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:57,931
Subhash, please tell him to hurry up.

1151
01:20:58,011 --> 01:20:58,665
Why? What happened?

1152
01:20:58,745 --> 01:21:01,411
He has found out that he
doesn't have the access card.

1153
01:21:03,666 --> 01:21:07,112
Subhash, he's going to the bank.
Please hurry up.

1154
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:16,778
I've got the access just now.

1155
01:21:16,858 --> 01:21:18,030
The files are getting copied.

1156
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:19,400
Please try to keep him back by any means.

1157
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,175
Impossible.

1158
01:21:20,255 --> 01:21:22,555
Impossible? Then I'm leaving.
- Okay.

1159
01:21:22,635 --> 01:21:24,582
I'll kill you. I've finished only 30%.

1160
01:21:24,662 --> 01:21:25,725
Manage it anyhow.

1161
01:21:25,884 --> 01:21:27,710
I'm not on a talk show.

1162
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:29,974
Sir, you were born on 30th February. Right?
- No.

1163
01:21:30,054 --> 01:21:33,067
Then you were born on 29th.
C'mon show me your hand.

1164
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:37,184
Diya , do something.

1165
01:21:37,813 --> 01:21:39,031
Sure, I'll try.

1166
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:44,247
You're married yet you've
extra-marital affairs.

1167
01:21:44,327 --> 01:21:45,319
You're a characterless man.

1168
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:47,388
How did you find out?
- I've ten years of experience.

1169
01:22:07,445 --> 01:22:09,728
Your wife watches the
family drama every day.

1170
01:22:09,808 --> 01:22:10,912
So, you go home late. Right?

1171
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:16,669
Hey! Hey stop! Stop!

1172
01:22:16,749 --> 01:22:18,212
Stop right there.

1173
01:22:18,292 --> 01:22:20,398
I need to go. Leave me.

1174
01:22:20,676 --> 01:22:22,032
How much work is left?

1175
01:22:24,619 --> 01:22:25,470
40%.

1176
01:22:25,768 --> 01:22:26,494
What kind of misbehavior is this?

1177
01:22:26,574 --> 01:22:29,309
What's this?
- I didn't take this.

1178
01:22:30,873 --> 01:22:33,093
Your sister goes around with old men.
- Leave my hand.

1179
01:22:33,674 --> 01:22:37,072
Keep the money. Please let me go.
- Stop! Hey!

1180
01:22:39,257 --> 01:22:41,339
Your stars are in unfavorable position.
- Enough of your nonsense.

1181
01:22:41,419 --> 01:22:42,197
Leave my hand.

1182
01:22:42,277 --> 01:22:43,851
How much money was he going to give you?
- 400 dollars.

1183
01:22:43,931 --> 01:22:44,985
Take the money from me.

1184
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:48,507
Oh my God!

1185
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:51,870
Isn't there any money in the bank?
- Somebody has hacked the password.

1186
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:52,956
All his money is getting transferred.

1187
01:22:53,036 --> 01:22:56,644
It's getting transferred
in some other account. Darn it.

1188
01:22:56,724 --> 01:22:59,379
What? Transfer my 400 dollars also.
- Get out.

1189
01:23:12,069 --> 01:23:13,944
You idiot!
- You fool!

1190
01:23:17,605 --> 01:23:19,570
What's going on?
- I don't know how this happened, sir.

1191
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:21,577
I lost the access card.
- Where is Subhash.

1192
01:23:24,663 --> 01:23:26,586
Let's go.
- He hasn't come out yet.

1193
01:23:28,358 --> 01:23:29,612
Let's get out of here.
- Yes, let's go.

1194
01:25:01,917 --> 01:25:03,812
He'll get caught.
He'll be in deep trouble.

1195
01:25:03,892 --> 01:25:05,671
The police here are very efficient.

1196
01:25:05,751 --> 01:25:09,052
They'll thrash him so badly that
he won't be able to walk for months.

1197
01:25:09,132 --> 01:25:10,592
The culprits never repeat their mistake.

1198
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:12,322
Really?
- Yes.

1199
01:25:12,402 --> 01:25:14,527
Walk more slowly and the
police will easily nab you.

1200
01:25:14,607 --> 01:25:16,957
I'm hungry. Let's eat something.
- Got it.

1201
01:25:17,037 --> 01:25:19,569
You'll send him to
jail and make me bankrupt.

1202
01:25:19,649 --> 01:25:21,100
After that you'll enjoy in Istanbul.

1203
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:22,657
I had doubts on you.

1204
01:25:22,737 --> 01:25:24,741
You've a gang. Will you tell me..

1205
01:25:24,821 --> 01:25:26,118
Brother-in-law..

1206
01:25:26,907 --> 01:25:28,796
Could you decode it?
- I could de-code 70%

1207
01:25:28,876 --> 01:25:32,028
I'm tired of looking for you.
How come you are here?

1208
01:25:32,108 --> 01:25:34,629
Did you know that he is here?
- Of course.

1209
01:25:34,709 --> 01:25:35,563
This was the plan.

1210
01:25:35,643 --> 01:25:37,694
Everybody should be aware of the plan.

1211
01:25:37,774 --> 01:25:40,040
Both of you're not aware 
of the actual matter.

1212
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:43,477
Somebody stole 4000 crore rupees
from Deepak Mehta's account.

1213
01:25:43,557 --> 01:25:44,867
Do you know that?
- I know.

1214
01:25:45,116 --> 01:25:46,845
You know?
- I stole the money.

1215
01:25:46,925 --> 01:25:49,890
Did you think I took this
risk only to find an address?

1216
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:52,125
Give people some money and
they'll get the address for you.

1217
01:25:52,271 --> 01:25:53,481
It's a matter of 4000 crores.

1218
01:25:53,561 --> 01:25:56,609
It's our country's money.
The amount was sanctioned by my dad.

1219
01:25:56,689 --> 01:25:59,612
He thought he would escape
with the money and I'll keep quiet.

1220
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:01,653
I've taken the money from
Deepak Mehta's main account..

1221
01:26:01,733 --> 01:26:04,663
..and all the proxy
accounts linked with it.

1222
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:07,499
I've returned the money to
the original bank with interest.

1223
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:09,291
It means you fooled me.

1224
01:26:09,371 --> 01:26:10,765
You are a born fool.

1225
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:14,807
I've also found his location.

1226
01:26:16,316 --> 01:26:17,382
Algornia.

1227
01:26:18,378 --> 01:26:19,409
Algornia.

1228
01:26:19,489 --> 01:26:22,094
It's not only time to
lose my job but also my life.

1229
01:26:22,174 --> 01:26:22,654
Why?

1230
01:26:23,076 --> 01:26:25,546
That territory is under
the control of the mafia, right?

1231
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:28,687
Yes, brother-in-law. Neither the police
nor the army can enter that area.

1232
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:30,244
It's under the mafia.

1233
01:26:30,324 --> 01:26:32,749
There's only one way to enter that place.

1234
01:26:32,829 --> 01:26:35,585
You can go there only if
a mafia personally invites you.

1235
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:39,412
Diya, do you've contacts there?

1236
01:26:40,416 --> 01:26:41,295
No way.

1237
01:26:41,502 --> 01:26:44,865
Ask her. I'm living here for the
last four years and you don't even ask me.

1238
01:26:44,945 --> 01:26:47,536
Idiot, I'm talking about
mafia and not a vegetable vendor.

1239
01:26:47,616 --> 01:26:51,923
I don't know mafia but I know Sofia.
- Sofia? Who is she?

1240
01:26:52,003 --> 01:26:53,811
My girlfriend. She stays there.

1241
01:26:58,555 --> 01:27:00,956
Is it paining?
- Yes, it is.

1242
01:27:02,887 --> 01:27:06,208
Bloody fool. I need to maintain
safe distance from him.

1243
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:09,364
Brother-in-law,
please think from my point of view.

1244
01:27:09,444 --> 01:27:11,979
Your sister stays in India
for eleven months in a year.

1245
01:27:12,059 --> 01:27:14,809
The population has increased in India.

1246
01:27:14,889 --> 01:27:16,712
Just imagine the extra heat
we need in cold place.

1247
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:18,019
You...
- Don't hit me.

1248
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:20,725
I flirt with her only virtually.
No physical. No practical.

1249
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:23,798
We talk only on phone.

1250
01:27:23,878 --> 01:27:25,188
Tomorrow is her birthday.

1251
01:27:25,268 --> 01:27:26,544
She has invited me.

1252
01:27:26,624 --> 01:27:28,157
If you want to enjoy the
cake I'll take you there tomorrow.

1253
01:27:28,237 --> 01:27:30,164
I can't wait so long.
I need to go there today.

1254
01:27:30,316 --> 01:27:32,654
The news that his account
has been hacked must've reached him.

1255
01:27:32,734 --> 01:27:33,914
He must've become alert.

1256
01:27:33,994 --> 01:27:36,592
Before he takes his next
step we need to catch him.

1257
01:27:36,672 --> 01:27:39,235
Brother-in-law,
please don't tell your sister about this.

1258
01:27:39,315 --> 01:27:42,578
You've already thrashed me
but she'll thrash me before everybody.

1259
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:45,207
My BP has shot up, my sugar levels
have increased, my hands are shivering.

1260
01:27:45,287 --> 01:27:47,516
Oh God! Please save me.

1261
01:27:47,711 --> 01:27:49,904
Soldier, you can see that mansion there.

1262
01:27:49,984 --> 01:27:52,790
It's the entry point of the mafia's den.

1263
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:54,707
The security is very tight here.

1264
01:27:54,787 --> 01:27:56,485
A rose comes with thorns.

1265
01:27:56,565 --> 01:28:00,366
Similarly my Sofia is surrounded
by huge cactus plants.

1266
01:28:00,446 --> 01:28:01,681
What nonsense!

1267
01:28:02,872 --> 01:28:05,321
I want to meet Sofia.

1268
01:28:05,895 --> 01:28:06,795
Wait here.

1269
01:28:07,792 --> 01:28:09,618
Call Sofia and tell her that
someone has come to meet her.

1270
01:28:09,798 --> 01:28:13,001
He has come to meet Sofia.
- Are you going to wrestle?

1271
01:28:13,081 --> 01:28:14,945
Put your biceps and chest inside.

1272
01:28:15,025 --> 01:28:17,166
Do you know what will happen if you don't?
We'll be killed.

1273
01:28:17,754 --> 01:28:19,746
He's my man. Send him in.

1274
01:28:19,826 --> 01:28:21,580
I'm waiting for him.
- She's Sofia.

1275
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:22,909
This is the voice that has made me crazy.

1276
01:28:22,989 --> 01:28:24,265
You've only ten minutes.

1277
01:28:25,475 --> 01:28:27,876
We've only ten minutes.
Follow me quietly.

1278
01:28:36,484 --> 01:28:38,753
Where's Sofia's house?
- It's over there.

1279
01:28:40,116 --> 01:28:43,174
I'm sure that Sofia will help us.

1280
01:28:43,254 --> 01:28:45,424
Sophie!
- Yes, please.

1281
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:46,897
Hello.

1282
01:28:46,977 --> 01:28:49,208
Sofia.
- No, I'm her maid.

1283
01:28:49,748 --> 01:28:53,247
If her maid is so beautiful then
her mistress will be paragon of beauty.

1284
01:28:53,327 --> 01:28:55,019
Brother-in-law, where did you go?

1285
01:28:55,288 --> 01:28:58,111
There's trouble if he's
with me and even if he's not.

1286
01:29:03,482 --> 01:29:05,524
As per the map let's go to the left.

1287
01:29:09,184 --> 01:29:12,020
Where's Sofia?
- Wait, she's coming.

1288
01:29:13,619 --> 01:29:15,293
Yes! She'll come.

1289
01:29:28,585 --> 01:29:30,052
Are you Sofia?

1290
01:29:30,132 --> 01:29:32,370
Yes darling, I'm your Sofia.

1291
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:34,065
Darling!

1292
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:39,620
Darling, stop.
- Stop!

1293
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:42,740
It's good that brother-in-law
and his girlfriend didn't see her.

1294
01:29:43,017 --> 01:29:44,076
We've reached.

1295
01:29:46,062 --> 01:29:46,941
Where is it?

1296
01:29:47,021 --> 01:29:48,470
Second on the left.

1297
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:49,943
Wait here.
- Okay.

1298
01:30:28,972 --> 01:30:29,844
Deepak..

1299
01:31:03,406 --> 01:31:04,167
Abort.

1300
01:31:25,221 --> 01:31:26,100
Catch her.

1301
01:31:29,635 --> 01:31:30,659
Break the door.

1302
01:33:26,777 --> 01:33:27,601
That way.

1303
01:34:04,106 --> 01:34:05,116
Hold this.

1304
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,209
Sit behind me quickly.

1305
01:35:17,173 --> 01:35:19,685
Go. Go fast.

1306
01:36:21,748 --> 01:36:23,616
Fast. Let's get out of here quickly.

1307
01:37:00,549 --> 01:37:01,455
Hey you!

1308
01:37:04,154 --> 01:37:06,458
What's going on?
You've landed me in trouble.

1309
01:37:06,538 --> 01:37:09,219
The police has reached my house.
- Keep quiet. Check with the card.

1310
01:37:13,295 --> 01:37:14,858
What are you doing?

1311
01:37:20,161 --> 01:37:23,177
At first they robbed the bank
and then they killed a gangster.

1312
01:37:23,257 --> 01:37:25,446
Oh God! Save me.

1313
01:37:27,439 --> 01:37:28,373
Got it.

1314
01:37:39,181 --> 01:37:41,665
Our guess is wrong, he's not a criminal.

1315
01:37:52,391 --> 01:37:54,189
He's the city commissioner of Istanbul.

1316
01:37:54,397 --> 01:37:56,569
What's going on?
Please tell me.

1317
01:37:57,905 --> 01:37:59,420
He was pretending to be blind.

1318
01:37:59,627 --> 01:38:01,074
He killed Deepak.

1319
01:38:01,433 --> 01:38:04,457
He tried to trap us first
and now he's trying to arrest us.

1320
01:38:04,537 --> 01:38:07,038
Why would he kill Deepak?
- I'm also thinking about the same.

1321
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,487
I thought that Deepak
was the real culprit.

1322
01:38:09,667 --> 01:38:10,567
But, he was just a pawn.

1323
01:38:10,647 --> 01:38:12,712
If we can catch him we'll know the truth.

1324
01:38:12,792 --> 01:38:14,710
He's a policeman.
How will we catch him?

1325
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:15,970
He'll come after us.

1326
01:38:19,615 --> 01:38:20,120
Hello.

1327
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:22,217
The person you're looking
for is in Argu market.

1328
01:38:40,549 --> 01:38:42,292
C'mon tell us who you work for.

1329
01:38:42,372 --> 01:38:43,503
Whose plan is it?

1330
01:38:44,742 --> 01:38:46,721
If you don't tell us you'll die.
C'mon tell us.

1331
01:38:46,801 --> 01:38:51,343
If I don't tell you then you'll kill me
and if I tell you then you'll be killed.

1332
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:52,817
It's your turn to die now.

1333
01:38:53,647 --> 01:38:55,840
No! No! I'll tell you.

1334
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,185
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.
- C'mon tell me.

1335
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:00,946
Malik!

1336
01:39:05,601 --> 01:39:09,240
Syed Ibrahim Malik.

1337
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:17,071
Syed Ibrahim Malik is the
mastermind behind the attacks.

1338
01:39:17,151 --> 01:39:19,313
Syed Ibrahim Malik has been traced.
He's in Dubai.

1339
01:39:19,393 --> 01:39:22,190
Syed Ibrahim Malik is the
mastermind of Hyderabad attacks.

1340
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:25,429
The number of deceased
in the blasts is over sixty now.

1341
01:39:26,301 --> 01:39:29,103
According to sources Ibrahim Malik
has shifted to Pakistan from Dubai.

1342
01:39:29,183 --> 01:39:32,375
The Pakistan government has
denied giving shelter to Malik.

1343
01:39:32,455 --> 01:39:36,886
After repeated pressures from India,
UN has declared Syed Malik a terrorist.

1344
01:39:37,764 --> 01:39:41,162
Syed Ibrahim Malik has been traced.
He's in Pakistan right now.

1345
01:39:41,242 --> 01:39:42,199
This is his location.

1346
01:39:42,279 --> 01:39:45,265
The other name for terrorism
is Syed Ibrahim Malik.

1347
01:39:45,345 --> 01:39:48,385
India's most wanted terrorist.
Syed Ibrahim Malik.

1348
01:39:48,696 --> 01:39:50,267
The search is still on.

1349
01:39:50,917 --> 01:39:52,349
This is totally unbelievable.

1350
01:39:52,429 --> 01:39:53,823
How can Malik be involved in this?

1351
01:39:53,903 --> 01:39:55,504
Sir, I've got this information just now.

1352
01:39:55,584 --> 01:39:58,105
Mr. Gupta was expected to be the
Prime Minister after the next election.

1353
01:39:58,185 --> 01:40:00,578
Malik knew that he
could be a threat to him.

1354
01:40:00,658 --> 01:40:03,614
If he had killed him in north India
then he would've been the prime suspect.

1355
01:40:03,694 --> 01:40:07,056
In order to avoid it
he cleverly chose our city.

1356
01:40:07,136 --> 01:40:10,031
The alliance meeting
gave him an opportunity.

1357
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:14,345
He used both bankrupt Deepak
and professional killer Kayra..

1358
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:15,471
..to kill Mr. Gupta.

1359
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:18,152
He spread the rumor that my
brother was behind the conspiracy..

1360
01:40:18,232 --> 01:40:19,622
..so that he could win the election.

1361
01:40:19,702 --> 01:40:21,551
He killed my brother to prove it.

1362
01:40:21,631 --> 01:40:23,775
I'll accept what you
say but where's the proof.

1363
01:40:23,855 --> 01:40:25,487
Both Kayra and Deepak are dead.

1364
01:40:25,567 --> 01:40:27,831
But what about Malik? He's still alive.

1365
01:40:27,911 --> 01:40:30,763
What do you mean?
- I'll rest only after I catch him.

1366
01:40:30,843 --> 01:40:33,314
Are you joking?
We don't even know where he is.

1367
01:40:35,191 --> 01:40:36,220
Pakistan.

1368
01:40:36,713 --> 01:40:37,803
That's what we think.

1369
01:40:37,883 --> 01:40:39,342
Pakistan government
has denied that he's there.

1370
01:40:39,422 --> 01:40:40,890
They had said the same
about Osama Bin Laden.

1371
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:42,447
What happened after that?
He was killed.

1372
01:40:42,527 --> 01:40:44,204
C'mon Subhash. That was America.

1373
01:40:44,284 --> 01:40:45,864
Their policy is different from ours.

1374
01:40:45,944 --> 01:40:46,677
I know it, sir.

1375
01:40:46,757 --> 01:40:49,298
I'll not go there as an army-man Subhash.
I'll go there as an ordinary man.

1376
01:40:49,378 --> 01:40:51,054
Our agents are posted
there for the last ten years.

1377
01:40:51,134 --> 01:40:53,381
But, we haven't got any
information about him till date.

1378
01:40:53,891 --> 01:40:58,077
Police, CD, CID, CBI,
RAW, military, intelligence, customs..

1379
01:40:58,157 --> 01:41:00,143
..there are several departments
and thousands of officers.

1380
01:41:00,223 --> 01:41:02,020
While he's just one man.

1381
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,655
Yet we don't get any information
about him or any glimpse about him.

1382
01:41:03,735 --> 01:41:05,419
We always get the same
answer that he can't be traced.

1383
01:41:05,499 --> 01:41:06,328
Enough of this.

1384
01:41:06,408 --> 01:41:08,006
This is not only about
my brother or Mr. Gupta.

1385
01:41:08,086 --> 01:41:11,602
240 people died in the Mumbai blasts.
120 people died in Hyderabad.

1386
01:41:11,682 --> 01:41:13,350
Seventeen terrorist attacks were
executed in the last twenty six years.

1387
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:15,875
More than seven thousand
people were killed.

1388
01:41:16,032 --> 01:41:17,328
Do you've an answer to anything?

1389
01:41:17,408 --> 01:41:19,836
Don't talk like a mad man?
If you go there then.. - I'll die. Right?

1390
01:41:20,354 --> 01:41:23,130
It's okay.
I'm ready to die for my country.

1391
01:41:23,709 --> 01:41:27,938
I understand your emotions.
But, I can't help you officially.

1392
01:41:28,018 --> 01:41:30,343
It's okay, sir. I can manage.
I'll go there today.

1393
01:41:30,423 --> 01:41:31,899
Are you sure that you want to go?
Do you think that's easy?

1394
01:41:31,979 --> 01:41:33,144
You're a criminal here.

1395
01:41:33,224 --> 01:41:35,358
It's impossible for
you to step out of Istanbul.

1396
01:41:35,438 --> 01:41:38,453
If you take the road then you'll
have to cross Syria, Iran, Afghanistan..

1397
01:41:38,533 --> 01:41:39,500
..and that too without visa.

1398
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:41,878
Yes, that's what we're
exactly going to do.

1399
01:41:41,958 --> 01:41:44,187
I can unofficially cross that route.

1400
01:41:44,267 --> 01:41:47,690
As soon as you reach Pakistan
contact our agent Imran.

1401
01:41:47,770 --> 01:41:50,467
But, on one condition.
Our country has issues with this country.

1402
01:41:50,547 --> 01:41:53,710
God forbids if you get caught then..

1403
01:41:54,575 --> 01:41:57,472
Got it, sir.
I'll never mention your name. Thank you.

1404
01:42:00,057 --> 01:42:02,167
Subhash, I'll also come with you.

1405
01:42:03,291 --> 01:42:04,830
No. I'll do it.

1406
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:05,963
This is my personal matter.

1407
01:42:06,043 --> 01:42:07,579
This is the reason why I'll go with you.

1408
01:42:07,659 --> 01:42:09,655
You didn't get her.
She's seeking your permission.

1409
01:42:09,735 --> 01:42:10,395
Take her with you.

1410
01:42:10,475 --> 01:42:12,007
How long can a honeybee
stay without a flower?

1411
01:42:12,087 --> 01:42:13,626
How long will you be alone?

1412
01:42:42,072 --> 01:42:43,034
Stop the car.

1413
01:42:43,912 --> 01:42:45,137
She's pregnant.

1414
01:42:45,870 --> 01:42:48,257
Where's the hospital?
- To the left.

1415
01:43:00,945 --> 01:43:01,934
Thanks, bro.

1416
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:44,562
Excuse me brother,
is Nawaz road on that side?

1417
01:43:44,642 --> 01:43:46,493
No, it's in this direction.
- Okay. Thank you.

1418
01:43:52,421 --> 01:43:53,438
This way.

1419
01:43:55,755 --> 01:43:56,945
I want to meet Imran.

1420
01:43:57,025 --> 01:43:58,267
Brother is inside.

1421
01:43:58,347 --> 01:44:00,210
Brother, somebody has come to meet you.

1422
01:44:01,304 --> 01:44:02,701
Please come.
- Go in.

1423
01:44:05,649 --> 01:44:08,223
It's my brother-in-law's wedding in Delhi.
I want you to stitch an attire for him.

1424
01:44:19,813 --> 01:44:21,896
Collect it from this
address after two days.

1425
01:44:34,772 --> 01:44:37,775
So, you want to secretly
take Malik to India?

1426
01:44:37,855 --> 01:44:38,654
That's impossible.

1427
01:44:38,734 --> 01:44:41,872
Do you think it's as easy
as taking a parcel of food home?

1428
01:44:41,952 --> 01:44:44,648
Do you know that Malik
is under the control of ISIS?

1429
01:44:44,869 --> 01:44:47,727
Nobody except them can go near him.

1430
01:44:47,807 --> 01:44:50,183
I've been working here under
cover for the last ten years.

1431
01:44:50,263 --> 01:44:53,697
Rehman sir had given me the
assignment to prove that he lives here.

1432
01:44:53,777 --> 01:44:55,261
But, I got no evidence.

1433
01:44:56,056 --> 01:45:00,132
I've gone crazy stitching dresses
for women for the last few years.

1434
01:45:00,212 --> 01:45:03,203
Forget about any evidence I
couldn't even see his face till date.

1435
01:45:03,283 --> 01:45:07,611
Fifteen years back RAW
went to Dubai to catch him.

1436
01:45:07,691 --> 01:45:10,696
Later on it was found that
the person they caught wasn't Malik..

1437
01:45:10,776 --> 01:45:12,004
..but his lookalike.

1438
01:45:12,084 --> 01:45:15,497
That was it and Malik escaped
from there and came to Pakistan.

1439
01:45:15,577 --> 01:45:18,236
The government takes money
from him and treats him like a king.

1440
01:45:18,316 --> 01:45:21,702
The military provides him with security.
He's living a grand life here.

1441
01:45:24,179 --> 01:45:25,591
Can you show me his house?

1442
01:45:34,018 --> 01:45:36,073
Why is the place decked up?
Any special occasion?

1443
01:45:36,153 --> 01:45:39,090
I've heard that it's his daughter's
wedding after three days.

1444
01:45:39,429 --> 01:45:42,030
I'm sure he'll come out
during the wedding. - No.

1445
01:45:42,529 --> 01:45:45,974
Due to security reasons the wedding
will take place inside the house.

1446
01:45:56,705 --> 01:45:58,892
What are you doing here? Get out of here.

1447
01:45:58,972 --> 01:45:59,951
Nothing. The car broke down.

1448
01:46:00,031 --> 01:46:01,494
C'mon get out of here.
- Okay, sir. we're leaving.

1449
01:46:01,574 --> 01:46:02,573
Let's go, brother.

1450
01:46:13,653 --> 01:46:16,296
He's Taheer Iqbal,
Pakistan's military general.

1451
01:46:19,194 --> 01:46:21,650
He's in-charge of Malik's security.

1452
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,889
The security system of this
house is divided in three layers.

1453
01:46:24,969 --> 01:46:27,379
The first layer is that
of the Pakistan police.

1454
01:46:30,748 --> 01:46:34,298
Second layer has trained
commandos from Pakistan's army.

1455
01:46:38,794 --> 01:46:43,423
The inner circle has the tightest
security for Malik's safety.

1456
01:46:43,503 --> 01:46:45,462
He's not an ordinary officer.
He's SWAT trained.

1457
01:46:45,542 --> 01:46:47,710
He's the one who plan
the attacks of ISIS.

1458
01:46:47,790 --> 01:46:51,225
He's expert in brainwashing youngsters
and making them terrorists.

1459
01:46:51,305 --> 01:46:53,888
It's impossible to get through
his security and meet Malik.

1460
01:46:55,142 --> 01:46:56,885
Everything here belongs
to my granddaughter.

1461
01:46:56,965 --> 01:46:59,341
Brother Taheer,
you're still in your uniform.

1462
01:46:59,421 --> 01:47:01,887
Come with your wife and children tomorrow.
- Yes.

1463
01:47:01,967 --> 01:47:03,264
Salma, keep it.

1464
01:47:03,344 --> 01:47:06,986
Malik, you need to postpone
the wedding for the time being.

1465
01:47:07,066 --> 01:47:10,023
Why? Is it for the Indian agent who has
crossed the borders and come here?

1466
01:47:10,103 --> 01:47:11,615
Do you think I'm a coward like you?

1467
01:47:11,695 --> 01:47:12,950
So, you know about him.

1468
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:15,759
I get all the information
at lightning speed.

1469
01:47:15,839 --> 01:47:17,738
His name is Col. Subhash.

1470
01:47:18,056 --> 01:47:20,982
SEAT training,
19th battalion, Madras regiment.

1471
01:47:25,245 --> 01:47:28,137
Look at his photo carefully. Get him.
- Okay, I will.

1472
01:47:28,217 --> 01:47:31,140
I suggest that you shift to a
safer place before this issue is resolved.

1473
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:33,396
Entire India is scared of me.

1474
01:47:33,476 --> 01:47:36,205
It's strange that I need to
be scared of this petty fellow now.

1475
01:47:36,285 --> 01:47:37,906
Your safety is my duty.

1476
01:47:37,986 --> 01:47:40,985
I request you shift
to the military safe-house.

1477
01:47:41,559 --> 01:47:43,559
Do you think you can protect me?

1478
01:47:43,953 --> 01:47:46,901
I've faced thousands absolutely alone.

1479
01:47:46,981 --> 01:47:48,340
I never sought any help.

1480
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:51,183
It's my daughter's
wedding and I'm very happy.

1481
01:47:52,256 --> 01:47:54,816
If you spoil my mood I'll kill you.

1482
01:47:58,234 --> 01:48:00,552
You asked for the blue print of his house.
This is it.

1483
01:48:01,872 --> 01:48:05,899
The right time to kidnap
him is the wedding night.

1484
01:48:06,369 --> 01:48:07,483
Impossible!

1485
01:48:07,676 --> 01:48:09,365
Limited guests will attend the wedding.

1486
01:48:09,445 --> 01:48:11,648
You can't enter without an invitation.

1487
01:48:11,728 --> 01:48:15,052
Even if we manage to enter
how will we fool the police..

1488
01:48:15,132 --> 01:48:17,597
..military and personal
security and reach him.

1489
01:48:17,677 --> 01:48:20,621
We can shoot him from a distance
and then get killed for it.

1490
01:48:20,701 --> 01:48:24,053
But even that will be difficult.
It's impossible to kidnap him.

1491
01:48:26,094 --> 01:48:27,104
It's possible.

1492
01:48:28,965 --> 01:48:29,962
I've a plan.

1493
01:48:31,615 --> 01:48:34,729
I want to know who gave the permission
to go ahead with this mission.

1494
01:48:34,809 --> 01:48:37,061
Our soldier has risked his life.

1495
01:48:37,141 --> 01:48:39,136
He's asking for a small favour in return.

1496
01:48:39,216 --> 01:48:42,270
Mr. Rehman, the relation between
the two countries is already strained.

1497
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:45,425
If our officer gets caught
not only the UN but the entire world..

1498
01:48:45,505 --> 01:48:46,747
..will support Pakistan.

1499
01:48:46,827 --> 01:48:49,798
We can't ruin the goodwill
of our country. No way.

1500
01:48:49,878 --> 01:48:52,932
Call him back right now or
I'll have to give the statement that..

1501
01:48:53,012 --> 01:48:56,121
..he trespassed the borders
without required permissions.

1502
01:48:56,201 --> 01:48:58,687
We'll be forced to give the
detail to the Pakistan embassy.

1503
01:48:58,767 --> 01:49:01,545
Sir, don't rush into any decision.

1504
01:49:01,625 --> 01:49:03,336
According to the information
we got from Subhash..

1505
01:49:03,416 --> 01:49:05,412
..Mr. Gupta was killed by Malik.

1506
01:49:05,585 --> 01:49:09,073
That's not all. A VVIP from India
is also involved with him.

1507
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:13,611
But, it's very important that
we bring Malik here to prove it.

1508
01:49:14,331 --> 01:49:15,715
What's the plan? Share it with me.

1509
01:49:30,803 --> 01:49:33,058
Okay, I'll speak with the high command.

1510
01:49:33,138 --> 01:49:35,390
Please keep your mission on hold till then.
- Okay, sir.

1511
01:49:38,461 --> 01:49:38,786
Sir..

1512
01:49:38,866 --> 01:49:42,440
We've to keep the mission on hold until
we get permission from the government.

1513
01:49:43,561 --> 01:49:44,847
The mission has started.

1514
01:49:45,518 --> 01:49:46,957
Subhash.. Subhash..

1515
01:49:50,826 --> 01:49:52,507
Isn't this design nice?

1516
01:49:53,233 --> 01:49:54,790
Do you want to apply it?

1517
01:51:00,355 --> 01:51:03,932
Subhash, Malik knows that you're here.

1518
01:51:04,012 --> 01:51:06,908
The police is searching you madly.

1519
01:51:08,008 --> 01:51:09,883
The situation is getting more complicated.

1520
01:51:10,796 --> 01:51:13,896
The chances of the mission's
success are very less.

1521
01:51:14,553 --> 01:51:18,592
If we make any mistake tomorrow
none of us will be alive.

1522
01:51:20,294 --> 01:51:22,536
So, I can't involve you in this mission.

1523
01:51:23,838 --> 01:51:26,938
Diya, this is my battle.
I'll fight it alone.

1524
01:51:27,429 --> 01:51:30,453
You can leave.
- Doesn't matter. We'll fight together.

1525
01:51:31,907 --> 01:51:34,619
We may win or lose
but I'll never leave you.

1526
01:51:34,699 --> 01:51:35,519
Bye.

1527
01:51:41,897 --> 01:51:43,467
Bye.
- Bye.

1528
01:52:14,194 --> 01:52:15,211
Who are you?

1529
01:52:41,493 --> 01:52:41,888
Sir.

1530
01:52:41,968 --> 01:52:44,849
Subhash, we've got permission
from the high command.

1531
01:52:46,634 --> 01:52:47,298
Thank you, sir.

1532
01:52:47,378 --> 01:52:51,823
But be careful, if you win it'll be
India's victory and not just yours.

1533
01:52:51,903 --> 01:52:53,165
But, a small mistake from your end..

1534
01:52:53,245 --> 01:52:55,130
..can spoil the relationship
between the countries further.

1535
01:52:55,372 --> 01:52:56,589
All the best, my boy.

1536
01:52:57,316 --> 01:52:58,250
Sir.

1537
01:53:11,892 --> 01:53:13,213
It's time for action.

1538
01:53:19,957 --> 01:53:23,506
"O Lord!"

1539
01:53:23,586 --> 01:53:26,426
"O Lord!"

1540
01:53:27,042 --> 01:53:30,508
"O Lord!"

1541
01:53:30,588 --> 01:53:33,234
"O Lord!"

1542
01:53:50,822 --> 01:53:53,245
Isn't this a nice design?
Do you want to apply it?

1543
01:53:54,373 --> 01:53:55,736
I'm very happy.

1544
01:54:03,660 --> 01:54:05,459
There should be no
loopholes in our security.

1545
01:54:27,417 --> 01:54:30,406
"O lord!"

1546
01:54:30,848 --> 01:54:33,982
"O lord!"

1547
01:54:34,328 --> 01:54:37,082
"O lord!"

1548
01:54:38,176 --> 01:54:41,449
"O lord!"

1549
01:54:41,670 --> 01:54:44,999
"O lord!"

1550
01:54:45,079 --> 01:54:48,458
"O lord!"

1551
01:54:48,748 --> 01:54:52,076
"O lord!"

1552
01:56:05,173 --> 01:56:07,477
Hey look there. Fire! Fire!

1553
01:56:27,737 --> 01:56:29,667
Why's there so much smoke here?
What happened?

1554
01:56:29,747 --> 01:56:30,809
The kitchen is on fire, sir.

1555
01:56:38,074 --> 01:56:40,267
Go and check quickly what's happening.

1556
01:56:51,705 --> 01:56:52,258
Yes, tell me.

1557
01:56:52,338 --> 01:56:56,002
Malik, I'm sure that the Indian
agent planned this fire outbreak.

1558
01:56:56,082 --> 01:56:58,264
Be alert and careful.
- Shut up. I can take care of myself.

1559
01:56:58,344 --> 01:57:02,035
You should've listened to my advice
and this wouldn't have happened.

1560
01:57:02,305 --> 01:57:04,678
I've got orders from higher authorities
to shift you to a safer place.

1561
01:57:04,758 --> 01:57:06,498
And I'm under pressure.
So, be ready.

1562
01:57:06,578 --> 01:57:07,453
Okay.

1563
01:58:39,186 --> 01:58:40,618
I'll kill him.
- Don't worry about him.

1564
01:58:40,698 --> 01:58:41,877
Think about your safety now.

1565
01:58:42,556 --> 01:58:43,704
Don't go out of the main gate.

1566
01:58:43,784 --> 01:58:45,372
I'm sure that he has
laid a trap for you there.

1567
01:58:45,452 --> 01:58:46,707
Take the rear exit.

1568
01:58:46,787 --> 01:58:48,721
Take the Shah Alam market route.

1569
01:59:24,635 --> 01:59:27,714
Move. Move. A car is coming. Move.

1570
01:59:28,461 --> 01:59:30,219
Step aside. Let the car go.

1571
01:59:31,664 --> 01:59:33,954
Close the barricade. Close it.

1572
02:01:24,884 --> 02:01:27,388
He's running with my car.
Catch him.

1573
02:02:40,271 --> 02:02:41,876
Hey Indian, stop the car.

1574
02:02:41,956 --> 02:02:43,592
I'll kill you. Stop the car.

1575
02:03:30,046 --> 02:03:31,651
Malik is in the car.

1576
02:04:28,734 --> 02:04:31,010
Do you want to go with me or die here?

1577
02:04:31,090 --> 02:04:33,072
Don't shoot. You're mistaken.

1578
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:34,359
I'm his lookalike.

1579
02:04:34,439 --> 02:04:36,054
The original Malik is downstairs.

1580
02:04:36,134 --> 02:04:38,025
If you don't believe me,
I'll call him here.

1581
02:04:38,565 --> 02:04:39,132
Hello.

1582
02:04:39,212 --> 02:04:40,080
Are you sleeping downstairs?

1583
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:42,626
I've an urgent work.
Come to my room immediately.

1584
02:04:46,756 --> 02:04:49,358
You made a mistake in hurry.
You're the original Malik.

1585
02:04:50,001 --> 02:04:53,149
If you were the lookalike
you wouldn't have ordered him.

1586
02:04:56,720 --> 02:04:58,560
Oh! You scared me.

1587
02:05:00,055 --> 02:05:00,933
Where do I have to go?

1588
02:05:01,013 --> 02:05:03,736
Taheer will be here in a few
minutes to take me to the safe-house.

1589
02:05:03,816 --> 02:05:07,028
If you want to stay alive
then get out of here immediately.

1590
02:05:08,065 --> 02:05:10,030
Your lookalike will go with Taheer.

1591
02:05:14,650 --> 02:05:15,695
Call him.

1592
02:05:19,044 --> 02:05:19,569
Hello.

1593
02:05:19,649 --> 02:05:21,071
You'll go with Taheer.
- Sir..

1594
02:05:21,230 --> 02:05:22,752
Do as I say.
- Okay.

1595
02:05:24,489 --> 02:05:25,499
Now move.

1596
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:21,851
Come on.

1597
02:07:06,963 --> 02:07:08,167
You may go.

1598
02:07:08,983 --> 02:07:09,827
Next.

1599
02:07:24,289 --> 02:07:25,472
What's wrong with him?

1600
02:07:25,552 --> 02:07:26,655
Medical visa.

1601
02:07:27,535 --> 02:07:29,652
We're taking him out
for kidney transplant surgery.

1602
02:07:29,732 --> 02:07:32,627
Don't we get good treatment in our
country? Why do you wish to go to India?

1603
02:07:32,772 --> 02:07:34,883
We're getting AB negative donors
only there.

1604
02:07:35,415 --> 02:07:37,304
Sir..
- What is it?

1605
02:07:38,031 --> 02:07:39,539
This is his medical report.

1606
02:07:39,619 --> 02:07:42,978
I think something is wrong.
Please check it.

1607
02:08:05,559 --> 02:08:06,507
Hello.

1608
02:08:06,587 --> 02:08:09,530
Pakistan immigration.
I want to talk to you about Zaheer Iman.

1609
02:08:09,610 --> 02:08:12,014
He's our patient.
He has a surgery scheduled tomorrow.

1610
02:08:12,094 --> 02:08:12,768
What's the matter?

1611
02:08:12,848 --> 02:08:14,332
It's a routine verification.

1612
02:08:14,412 --> 02:08:15,286
Okay.

1613
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:19,923
Send them.

1614
02:08:27,857 --> 02:08:30,806
Uncle, how is he?
- Don't worry. Malik is absolutely fine.

1615
02:09:07,878 --> 02:09:09,953
Don't worry, the doctors
are taking good care of him.

1616
02:09:10,033 --> 02:09:12,105
He's okay. Everything is fine.

1617
02:09:12,185 --> 02:09:13,371
Everything is okay.

1618
02:09:50,097 --> 02:09:52,014
Malik, are you okay?

1619
02:10:00,517 --> 02:10:02,862
Enter runway 25.
- Roger, entering.

1620
02:10:02,942 --> 02:10:04,730
We thought that he abducted the lookalike.

1621
02:10:04,810 --> 02:10:06,370
But, he has kidnapped the real Malik.

1622
02:10:06,450 --> 02:10:08,763
We've been deceived.
He has played his game really well.

1623
02:10:09,054 --> 02:10:12,056
He set the wedding venue
on fire to confuse us.

1624
02:10:12,136 --> 02:10:14,056
But he forgot that this is Pakistan.

1625
02:10:14,136 --> 02:10:15,675
Seal all the check-posts.

1626
02:10:15,755 --> 02:10:17,433
Close all possible ways.
- Yes, sir.

1627
02:10:18,726 --> 02:10:22,331
Is there any flight to India right now?

1628
02:10:22,614 --> 02:10:25,112
Sir, a flight is going to
leave for Delhi in ten minutes.

1629
02:10:25,192 --> 02:10:25,686
Yes.

1630
02:10:25,766 --> 02:10:28,114
Fax Subhash photo to the airport security.
- Okay, sir.

1631
02:10:28,194 --> 02:10:30,094
If they spot any person who resembles him
then he should be detained.

1632
02:10:30,174 --> 02:10:32,121
Remember that there should be
no mistakes. Do it fast.

1633
02:10:32,286 --> 02:10:35,927
FA908, enter runway.
25 main line up..

1634
02:10:36,007 --> 02:10:38,202
..and be ready for immediate take-off.

1635
02:10:38,282 --> 02:10:39,684
Roger. Copy.

1636
02:10:48,635 --> 02:10:52,138
FA908, you're on line get ready.

1637
02:10:53,132 --> 02:10:53,716
Hello.

1638
02:10:53,796 --> 02:10:56,210
Sir, the photo sent by you matches
with the passenger of seat number 16..

1639
02:10:56,290 --> 02:10:57,343
..on the flight to Delhi.

1640
02:10:57,423 --> 02:11:00,526
Call the ATC immediately.
Tell them to abort the flight immediately.

1641
02:11:00,751 --> 02:11:01,538
Yes, sir.

1642
02:11:01,711 --> 02:11:03,847
Tell ATC to stop the
flight to Delhi immediately.

1643
02:11:03,927 --> 02:11:04,886
Roger, waiting.

1644
02:11:04,966 --> 02:11:09,054
FA908 enter the runway.

1645
02:11:09,134 --> 02:11:10,551
25 main line up.

1646
02:11:10,631 --> 02:11:13,620
You're clear for takeoff.
- Roger, clear for takeoff.

1647
02:11:29,299 --> 02:11:30,207
Stop the flight to Delhi.

1648
02:11:30,287 --> 02:11:32,023
There's a terrorist in it.
Do it right now.

1649
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:36,641
Call the ATC.
Stop the flight to Delhi immediately.

1650
02:11:42,193 --> 02:11:43,075
Sir, I'm unable to connect with the ATC.

1651
02:11:43,155 --> 02:11:44,554
I'm sure somebody
is carrying a cell-phone.

1652
02:11:44,634 --> 02:11:45,722
Sir, cell-phones aren't allowed inside.

1653
02:11:45,802 --> 02:11:46,717
Cell-phones aren't allowed.

1654
02:11:46,797 --> 02:11:49,173
If cell-phones aren't allowed
then you go inside and inform them.

1655
02:11:49,253 --> 02:11:50,134
I'm on the way and will reach there soon.

1656
02:12:25,911 --> 02:12:29,656
Turn right at 240 degrees for takeoff.
Fly to 8000 feet.

1657
02:12:29,736 --> 02:12:30,953
Roger, copy.

1658
02:13:00,371 --> 02:13:02,161
Move. Step aside.

1659
02:13:02,241 --> 02:13:04,384
Let me go. Move. Please step aside.

1660
02:13:50,866 --> 02:13:53,279
FA908 runway clear. Ready for take-off?

1661
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:55,104
Roger, ready for take-off.

1662
02:14:11,261 --> 02:14:12,455
Stop the flight to Delhi immediately.

1663
02:14:12,535 --> 02:14:14,591
What's the matter?
- There are terrorists in it.

1664
02:14:15,326 --> 02:14:17,436
FA908 reject take-off immediately.

1665
02:14:17,516 --> 02:14:18,939
Reject take-off immediately.
Reject take-off.

1666
02:14:19,019 --> 02:14:20,401
Roger, why reject take-off?

1667
02:14:20,481 --> 02:14:22,813
There are terrorists ion the flight.
- There are terrorists in the flight.

1668
02:14:22,893 --> 02:14:24,500
We're stopping the flight.

1669
02:15:12,495 --> 02:15:15,401
'The flight has been stopped
due to security reasons.'

1670
02:15:15,481 --> 02:15:17,442
'Please bear with us. Thank you.'

1671
02:15:27,396 --> 02:15:28,598
Boarding pass.

1672
02:15:30,180 --> 02:15:31,443
What's your name?
- Rashid.

1673
02:15:31,523 --> 02:15:33,233
Where are you from?
- Karachi.

1674
02:15:41,017 --> 02:15:42,461
Sir, your doubt is correct.

1675
02:15:42,541 --> 02:15:45,289
Passengers with these names
have left by the flight to Nepal.

1676
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:54,673
Stop the flight by any means.

1677
02:15:54,753 --> 02:15:55,788
Ask the flight to return.

1678
02:15:55,868 --> 02:15:56,991
Sir, that's impossible.

1679
02:15:57,071 --> 02:15:58,141
The flight has taken off.

1680
02:15:58,221 --> 02:16:01,497
By the time you complete the formalities
the flight will have crossed our borders.

1681
02:16:07,007 --> 02:16:11,850
'Dear passengers, right now we're flying
over the beautiful Himalayan mountains.'

1682
02:16:11,930 --> 02:16:14,250
'You've entered Nepal now.'

1683
02:16:24,380 --> 02:16:26,056
Sir, call for you.

1684
02:16:27,115 --> 02:16:30,056
Hello.
- Sir, our mission is successful.

1685
02:16:32,348 --> 02:16:34,575
Yes! Yes!

1686
02:16:38,554 --> 02:16:39,646
Yes!

1687
02:16:51,181 --> 02:16:54,133
Superb, uncle
That was a thrilling story.

1688
02:16:54,213 --> 02:16:56,890
It must've been so difficult for you.

1689
02:16:57,495 --> 02:17:00,068
What happened after that?
- After that?

1690
02:17:00,148 --> 02:17:02,793
He was handed over to
the Indian army in Nepal.

1691
02:17:16,578 --> 02:17:18,654
Well-done, Subhash.
- Thank you, sir.

1692
02:17:21,593 --> 02:17:24,543
What next? - He confessed
everything after some thrashing.

1693
02:17:24,623 --> 02:17:26,148
All his partners were also arrested.

1694
02:17:26,307 --> 02:17:29,608
Mr. Varma who planned Mr. Gupta's murder
wanted to be the PM.

1695
02:17:29,688 --> 02:17:31,233
He was arrested by the police.

1696
02:17:31,313 --> 02:17:34,084
Uncle, what was the
punishment given to Malik?

1697
02:17:34,164 --> 02:17:36,195
Malik was a dangerous criminal.

1698
02:17:36,275 --> 02:17:38,084
He tried to escape on the way to jail.

1699
02:17:38,311 --> 02:17:40,961
But, the police shot him dead.

1700
02:17:41,605 --> 02:17:42,940
My super uncle!

1701
02:17:43,020 --> 02:17:45,742
Grandfather always said that good things
happen to good people..

1702
02:17:45,822 --> 02:17:46,967
..and evil people are always punished.

1703
02:17:47,047 --> 02:17:50,924
I request our honourable President
to unveil the photograph..

1704
02:17:51,004 --> 02:17:53,775
..of Late Mr. Shravan Kumar.

1705
02:18:06,367 --> 02:18:08,104
Uncle, put me down.

1706
02:18:52,693 --> 02:18:53,549
Hey!

1707
02:19:03,511 --> 02:19:04,731
No! Stop!

1708
02:19:05,544 --> 02:19:07,490
Don't shoot. Don't kill me.
