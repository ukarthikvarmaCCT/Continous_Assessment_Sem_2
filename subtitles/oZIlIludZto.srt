00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,311
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,311 --> 00:00:03,891
On 8th August 1942,

3
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:05,620
in the Gwalior Tank Maidan, Mumbai,

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,644
the leaders of the All India Congress Committee gathered.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,500
They were about to announce a movement.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,976
A final struggle against the British 
imperialist government in power.

7
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:25,303
In front of thousands of people,

8
00:00:25,303 --> 00:00:28,373
Mahatma Gandhi gave a historic speech.

9
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:32,514
"Every one of you should consider yourself free.

10
00:00:32,514 --> 00:00:35,682
We can no longer live under the shoes of imperialism.

11
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:38,259
We need complete freedom.

12
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:40,504
I give you a mantra.

13
00:00:40,504 --> 00:00:42,000
You may imprint it on your hearts

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and let every breath of yours give expression to it.

15
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:46,560
This mantra is 'Do or Die'.

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,354
Do or Die.

17
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:50,495
Either we will see India free

18
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:52,555
or we will be k!ll3d in this attempt.

19
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:55,406
But we shall not live in this slavery anymore.

20
00:00:55,406 --> 00:00:57,418
Long live Mother India!

21
00:00:57,418 --> 00:01:00,296
We'll succeed or d!e trying! 

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,543
We'll succeed or d!e trying!"

23
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:05,872
Friends, this was the beginning of

24
00:01:05,872 --> 00:01:07,877
the Quit India Movement.

25
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,912
Quit India Movement.

26
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:12,205
The British government was aware of it.

27
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:15,765
Since a few months prior to this, the 
Home Department of the British government

28
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:20,137
was working on a 3-stage plan to end this movement.

29
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:22,886
Stage 1. Use of Propaganda.

30
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:25,549
Controlling the media in such a way that

31
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:28,414
no newspaper could publish this news.

32
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:31,807
Stage 2. Raiding the offices of Congress organizations,

33
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:33,530
seizing their funds,

34
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,011
and arresting all the leaders of Congress.

35
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:39,086
Stage 3, was to suppress the mass movement,

36
00:01:39,086 --> 00:01:41,104
using emergency powers,

37
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:44,419
declaring the Congress leaders as anti-national,

38
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:48,737
and thus, ending the movement 
before it even began.

39
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:50,321
The next day, 9th August,

40
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:52,458
Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru,

41
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,449
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Maulana Azad

42
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:56,635
and all the top leaders of Congress

43
00:01:56,635 --> 00:01:59,607
were arrested and put in jail.

44
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:02,560
These leaders were not to be 
released from jail for many years.

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,597
Then the question was: 
how to further this movement?

46
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:09,642
In today's video, you will hear 
a great story of inspiration.

47
00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:11,759
Amidst so much oppression and difficulties,

48
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,580
How does the slogan of revolution

49
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,362
reach every corner of the country?

50
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:17,655
And who were those traitors living in the country

51
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:20,821
who were on the side of the British 
during this movement?

52
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:23,612
Let's understand the Quit India Movement in depth

53
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:25,367
in today's video.

54
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,226
It was exactly 2 years before this movement started.

55
00:02:36,226 --> 00:02:38,311
8th August 1940.

56
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:44,032
British Raj had presented an offer to Indian 
freedom fighters through Viceroy Linlithgow.

57
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:46,797
It was called the August Offer.

58
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:49,762
In this, he said that the Indian 
representation would be increased

59
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:51,048
in the British-Indian government.

60
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:53,751
Actually, this was the time

61
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:56,599
when World War II was in full rage in Europe.

62
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,422
Germany's dictator Adolf Hitler

63
00:02:58,422 --> 00:03:01,303
was successfully invading one country after another

64
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:04,552
and Britain was the only country standing against him.

65
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,510
The British government in the UK

66
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,695
was in big trouble and was desperate

67
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:10,773
to get help from wherever it could. 

68
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,382
Although Indian soldiers were already 
fighting on behalf of the British in World War II

69
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:18,041
the British wanted more cooperation from the Indians.

70
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:22,341
So they decided to send in an offer to convince the Indians.

71
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:24,219
Till this time, Congress had decided that

72
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,086
they would not accept inconsequential offers.

73
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:27,805
They wanted complete freedom.

74
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:30,164
They said that if the British government wanted

75
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:32,959
India to cooperate with them in WWII

76
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,242
then they would have to give 
complete independence to India.

77
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:37,439
So this August Offer was a failure.

78
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,911
After this, in March 1942,

79
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:42,721
another delegation was sent by Britain.

80
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:44,898
It was called the Cripps Mission because

81
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:47,889
the leader of the House of Commons 
at that time was Stafford Cripps.

82
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:49,449
The mission's aim was

83
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:51,842
to give India independence 
after the end of World War II,

84
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:55,660
but the offer given by the British in the Cripps Mission

85
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,069
was not of full freedom,

86
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,652
but of Dominion status.

87
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:02,338
As per the Cripps Offer, 
India would be an autonomous region

88
00:04:02,338 --> 00:04:04,009
under the British Commonwealth.

89
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:05,919
This was a better offer than the previous one,

90
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,545
but Congress outrightly rejected it.

91
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:10,790
They clearly stated their goal,

92
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,922
complete freedom.

93
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:16,069
By then, Congress leaders were 
fed up with these offers and negotiations.

94
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:19,003
A few months later, on 14th July 1942

95
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:20,307
in the Wardha Committee,

96
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:24,740
a resolution was passed to 
start a civil disobedience movement.

97
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,646
Many prominent leaders of the time like

98
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:28,592
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra Prasad

99
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:31,118
and Jayaprakash Narayan showed great interest

100
00:04:31,118 --> 00:04:32,546
in this initiative.

101
00:04:32,546 --> 00:04:35,088
9 days after the meeting, on 23rd July,

102
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,786
Secretary of State for India Lord Amery,

103
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:40,756
wrote a letter to the Secretary of State 
for the Colonies Viscount Cranborne.

104
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:43,970
He stated that the resolution 
passed at the Wardha meeting

105
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,928
would be approved on 7th August in the 
All India Congress Committee meeting.

106
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:50,508
After this, a mass movement would begin

107
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:53,759
which would be a direct challenge to the British Empire.

108
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,334
He stated that they should 
take strict measures to prevent it.

109
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:57,731
He wrote in the letter,

110
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,704
"If necessary, we have to contemplate,

111
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:01,178
therefore, the probable arrest of Gandhi

112
00:05:01,178 --> 00:05:02,335
and of the members of the Working Committee. 

113
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,965
It is also mentioned that

114
00:05:03,965 --> 00:05:07,502
some of the Congress leaders 
should be deported to Africa

115
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:09,158
so that this movement could not begin.

116
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:11,385
The next day, the British Raj's Home Department

117
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:13,791
shared a three-stage plan with Amery

118
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,616
to stifle this movement.

119
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:18,126
The same plan that I mentioned
at the beginning of the video.

120
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:22,176
This is the reason why when the 
All India Committee passed the Quit India Resolution,

121
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:24,257
the British already knew about it.

122
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,525
After Mahatma Gandhi's historic speech,

123
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:29,181
on 9th August, at around 5 in the morning,

124
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:32,466
Gandhi and the other top leaders were arrested.

125
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:36,584
After the arrest, Mahatma Gandhi 
was taken to the Aga Khan Palace in Pune.

126
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:39,054
The British had a strategic reason for this.

127
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:41,713
Viceroy Linlithgow wrote to Amery saying that

128
00:05:41,713 --> 00:05:45,380
they should send the Mahatma to a place 

129
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,776
that doesn't have the word 'Jail' in its name.

130
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:50,237
If the people were to find out that he was put into a 'jail'

131
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:52,045
it might infuriate the masses.

132
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:55,140
So they decided to pretend that Gandhi 
was placed under house-arrest in a Palace.

133
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,581
"We may be quite certain

134
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:59,693
that we shall have some 
uphill propaganda battles to fight.

135
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,826
After these arrests, the Congress party was banned.

136
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:05,589
All the offices of Congress across the country

137
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,677
were sealed and declared anti-national.

138
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,821
Two other influential organizations of that time,

139
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:14,034
the Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha,

140
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:15,859
didn't face any restrictions.

141
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:17,551
Because both these organizations

142
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:20,018
were not supporting the Quit India Movement.

143
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:26,145
I will discuss this in detail later in the video,

144
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:28,197
but before that let's see the media's reaction.

145
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:34,191
Not a single word of Gandhi's historic speech 
was allowed to be printed in the newspapers.

146
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:37,839
So neither did any newspaper publish 
Mahatma Gandhi's speech,

147
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,645
nor did they talk about the British government's action.

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,766
How could one convey Gandhi's message to the people?

149
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:47,427
Friends, at this point in our story, enters

150
00:06:47,427 --> 00:06:49,973
22-year-old activist Usha Mehta.

151
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:51,768
Along with some of her colleagues

152
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:55,644
she found a transmitter and 
started an underground radio station.

153
00:06:55,644 --> 00:06:59,143
Congress Radio 42.34 thus began.

154
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:11,372
It was on 14th August when this 
underground radio station began transmitting.

155
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:14,678
And the words you just heard 
were spoken by none other than Usha Mehta.

156
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:17,575
Through this radio, the messages of 
the All India Congress Committee

157
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:19,708
were broadcast to every corner of the country.

158
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:24,847
Such underground media channels started 
opposing the propaganda of the British Raj.

159
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:26,481
To keep their location hidden,

160
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:28,225
in her messages Usha Mehta used to say,

161
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:30,743
"This is Congress Radio 
from somewhere in India."

162
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:33,430
But actually, she was operating from Bombay.

163
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,151
It took the British government about 3 months 
to find the source of this radio.

164
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:40,033
But by then, a lot of people were already aware.

165
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:43,144
Gradually, All India Radio was called Anti-India Radio

166
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:47,062
when they tried to jam the Congress radio.

167
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:50,111
Finally, on 12th November 1942,

168
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:52,896
the British government arrested Usha Mehta.

169
00:07:52,896 --> 00:07:55,087
All her equipment was seized

170
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:59,113
and despite interrogating her for 6 months,

171
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:01,885
she does not reveal anything to the British.

172
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:03,503
Later, in 1969,

173
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:05,892
when she was interviewed, she said,

174
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:08,132
"When the press is gagged and all news banned,

175
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:10,693
a transmitter certainly helps a good deal

176
00:08:10,693 --> 00:08:13,935
in furnishing the public with...spreading the message
of rebellion in the remotest corners of the country."

177
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:16,687
When this movement began, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose

178
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:18,767
was living in Berlin, Germany.

179
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:21,167
And he was trying his best

180
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,119
to raise awareness through his Azad Hind Radio.

181
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:28,263
As soon as the news of the 
Quit India Movement reached Netaji,

182
00:08:28,263 --> 00:08:30,622
he told his friend ACN Nambiar,

183
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:33,539
it was time to support Gandhi.

184
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,065
Although there was a lot of difference in 
the methods of Netaji and Gandhi ji,

185
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:41,280
Netaji was completely in favour 
of the Quit India Movement.

186
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,832
He called this movement 
India's Non-Violent Guerrilla Warfare.

187
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:48,994
On one hand, our freedom fighters were 
trying to raise awareness among the masses, 

188
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:51,464
on the other hand, some new faces emerged

189
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,265
who were ready to protest on the ground.

190
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:57,974
A few words from Mahatma Gandhi 
inspired people to such an extent that

191
00:08:57,974 --> 00:08:59,518
it's beyond our imagination.

192
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:08,872
Matangiri Hazra was a 72-year-old woman
who lived in the Bengal Presidency.

193
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:10,871
She is known as Gandhi Buri in Bengali,

194
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:12,239
which means old female-Gandhi.

195
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,640
On 29 September 1942,

196
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,103
she led a rally of 6,000 people in her district.

197
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:23,168
Her plan was to hoist the flag at 
the Tamluk police station nearby

198
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:25,239
and to capture the police station.

199
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:28,655
She was more courageous than her age.

200
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:31,489
Despite the police threats, she did not stop.

201
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:36,353
"Vande Mataram!"

202
00:09:36,353 --> 00:09:38,332
She was leading this rally from the front,

203
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:40,310
chanting Vande Mataram

204
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,968
when she was shot thrice.

205
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:45,967
Even after she was shot,

206
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:47,751
she didn't stop chanting Vande Mataram.

207
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:51,262
Eventually, she fell down, holding the Tiranga in her hand.

208
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:53,663
After 30 years of independence, in 1977,

209
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,747
Hazra became the first woman revolutionary

210
00:09:55,747 --> 00:09:58,733
whose statue was erected in Kolkata Maidan.

211
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,662
Thousands of people like Hazra,

212
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:04,984
were open fired at by the British in an effort to suppress this movement.

213
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:08,669
Ram Manohar Lohia wrote a letter 
to the then Vice Royal Linlithgow,

214
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:10,216
in which he stated that

215
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:12,657
more than 50,000 revolutionaries were k!ll3d

216
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:14,566
during this Quit India Movement.

217
00:10:14,566 --> 00:10:18,717
Apart from this, more than 100,000 arrests were made.

218
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:21,312
These include many names 
that might not have never heard of.

219
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:22,801
Like Sucheta Kripalani,

220
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:25,747
who later became the 4th Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh.

221
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:28,033
She led her own underground movement.

222
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,221
Some leaders were ready to be arrested

223
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:32,665
and they had already made alternate plans.

224
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,285
For example, when Yusuf Meher Ali 
was arrested on 9th August,

225
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:39,030
he had already told his friends

226
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,321
that it was their responsibility to 
continue the movement further.

227
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:44,591
One of them was Aruna Asaf Ali,

228
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:48,753
who led the first demonstration of 
the Quit India Movement on 9th August 

229
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:50,355
in Gwalior Tank Maidan.

230
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:53,984
She was later called the Grand Old Lady 
of the Independence Movement.

231
00:10:53,984 --> 00:10:55,736
She was the first mayor of Delhi

232
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:58,457
and in 1997, she was awarded Bharat Ratna.

233
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,385
During the movement, Aruna Asaf Ali 
was saved from being arrest

234
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:02,296
by being underground.

235
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:04,424
On the other hand, there were some leaders

236
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:08,171
who were jailed but when they came out
they continued their work.

237
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:10,122
Like Jai Prakash Narayan,

238
00:11:10,122 --> 00:11:12,435
who was put in Hazaribagh Central Jail

239
00:11:12,435 --> 00:11:16,395
and together with his friends, he made a plan to escape from the jail.

240
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:19,217
On the night of Diwali, 8th November 1942,

241
00:11:19,217 --> 00:11:21,032
when most of the guards were not on duty,

242
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:23,879
they successfully carried out a historic jail break.

243
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,399
He escaped from the jail with 7 other prisoners,

244
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,701
and fled to Nepal, where

245
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:30,689
he started the Azad Dastan.

246
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:32,875
There are many more such stories from all over the country,

247
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,755
where during the Quit India Movement, not only the leaders,

248
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:38,557
but even the common people were 
doing their best to take part in the protest.

249
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:41,797
From collecting school fees by the students

250
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:44,784
to blocking the railway tracks by the villagers,

251
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:46,543
no stones were left unturned.

252
00:11:46,543 --> 00:11:48,401
The British government's police station, courts,

253
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:52,214
post offices, and other symbols of the government authorities

254
00:11:52,214 --> 00:11:53,746
were attacked.

255
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,750
In colleges, the students went on strike,

256
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,102
and marches were organised.

257
00:11:57,102 --> 00:11:58,732
In Bombay, Jamshedpur, and Ahmedabad,

258
00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:01,777
factory workers did not go to work for weeks.

259
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:03,326
This is also something to note.

260
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:06,774
Not everyone needs to take out rallies 
to participate in the movement.

261
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:09,918
Stopping your work, going on organized strikes

262
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:13,078
is also a way to participate in the movement.

263
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:15,029
In some places, there was violence too.

264
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,089
Bridges were blown up, 
telegraph wires were cut,

265
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:19,189
and railway lines were blocked.

266
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:20,595
In places like UP and Bihar, at that time,

267
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:23,154
there were slogans to set police stations on fire.

268
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:27,512
On 31st August, Viceroy Linlithgaon wrote 
a letter to Winston Churchill stating that

269
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:30,041
"I am engaged here in the meeting by far

270
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,973
the most serious rebellion since that of 1857."

271
00:12:32,973 --> 00:12:35,351
He acknowledged that the revolution he was dealing with

272
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:36,845
was so big that

273
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:40,031
the last comparable revolution was in 1857.

274
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:42,729
All the strategies of the British government failed here.

275
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,045
Despite arresting all the top leaders,

276
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,122
this movement was moving ahead rapidly because

277
00:12:47,122 --> 00:12:50,465
the common people were participating in this.

278
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:51,816
How many people could you shoot?

279
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:53,121
How many could you put in jail?

280
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:54,955
By then, violence was already on the rise.

281
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:57,303
It is also very interesting to note what

282
00:12:57,303 --> 00:12:59,990
Mahatma Gandhi thought about this violence.

283
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,209
We know that in 1922

284
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:05,206
when violence was seen in the non-cooperation movement,

285
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:07,216
he stopped that movement.

286
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:10,879
Once again in 1934, during the Civil Disobedience Movement

287
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,522
when violence began,

288
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:14,773
Gandhi ji stopped that movement.

289
00:13:14,773 --> 00:13:17,201
But now, during the Quit India Movement,

290
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:20,019
when violent incidents were again seen,

291
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:22,462
Gandhi ji was already tired.

292
00:13:22,462 --> 00:13:26,581
On 7th June 1942, he wrote in his weekly magazine, Harijan,

293
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,302
"I waited and waited."

294
00:13:28,302 --> 00:13:32,411
"...until the country...develop(ed) non-violent strength

295
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,944
necessary to throw off the foreign yoke.

296
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:37,592
I feel that I cannot afford to wait...

297
00:13:37,592 --> 00:13:39,226
If in-spite of all precautions,

298
00:13:39,226 --> 00:13:41,626
rioting takes place,

299
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:43,543
it cannot be helped."

300
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:46,123
Gandhi ji's approach this time was pragmatic,

301
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:48,005
considering this complex situation.

302
00:13:48,005 --> 00:13:51,432
He blamed all this violence on the British government.

303
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:55,092
Here, if you want to understand 
Mahatma Gandhi's ideology in depth,

304
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:57,942
then I would like to recommend his autobiography.

305
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:00,514
'The Story of My Experiments with Truth'

306
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:02,515
You will find this on KUKU FM Bytes,

307
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:04,387
which was recently launched by KUKU FM.

308
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:09,909
Basically, KUKU FM condenses the ideas of the bestselling books and topics

309
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:11,600
and gives it to you in a byte form.

310
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,892
Instead of listening to the entire audiobook,

311
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:13,844
this is an alternative.

312
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:17,146
Listening to Bytes on KUKU FM normally takes only 15 minutes.

313
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:19,580
It is especially more useful for those people who

314
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,938
don't have time to listen to hours-long audiobooks.

315
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:25,189
If you haven't joined KUKU FM yet, do try it.

316
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:27,282
It's a great audio-learning platform.

00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:29,103
Use the coupon code DHRUV50.

318
00:14:29,103 --> 00:14:33,306
You will get 50% off on the first month's subscription to KUKU FM.

319
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,832
Instead of ₹99,
it will cost you only ₹49.

320
00:14:35,832 --> 00:14:38,530
You will find the link in the description below.

321
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,475
Now, let's get back to the topic.

322
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:44,701
In this entire struggle, many people 
didn't participate in this movement.

323
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:46,157
Which is understandable.

324
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:50,717
Not everyone dares to raise their 
voice against the people in power.

325
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:52,616
But there were some people who

326
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:54,566
were bootlicking the British so much that

327
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:58,881
they were supporting the British 
in ending the Quit India Movement.

328
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:00,906
There were two major organizations at that time.

329
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:02,910
Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha.

330
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,845
The Muslim League passed a resolution in 1940

331
00:15:05,845 --> 00:15:08,050
which is known as the Lahore Resolution.

332
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,118
Because of this, they demanded

333
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,863
that a separate country be created for Muslims.

334
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:15,142
It is also called the Pakistan Resolution.

335
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:17,506
At that time, there was a Muslim League leader Fazlul Huq,

336
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:20,700
he was the first Prime Minister of Bengal Province.

337
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,736
Their government in Bengal was formed 
with an alliance with the Hindu Mahasabha.

338
00:15:24,736 --> 00:15:26,474
In this Muslim League government,

339
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:30,830
Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the Finance Minister.

340
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,263
It was on 26 July 1942,

341
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:35,323
about two weeks before the start of the Quit India Movement.

342
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:38,630
Syama Prasad Mukherjee wrote a letter to the British government.

343
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,951
"Anybody who, during the war,

344
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:41,227
plans to stir up mass feelings, 

345
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:43,879
resulting in internal disturbances or insecurity

346
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,379
must be resisted by the government."

347
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:50,820
Further, he asked about how the Quit India 
Movement could be combated in Bengal.

348
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,111
He states that the administration should be such that

349
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:55,628
all efforts by the Congress would fail.

350
00:15:55,628 --> 00:15:58,462
And the movement would not begin in the Bengal Province.

351
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:02,053
He was, literally, discussing ideas with the British government

352
00:16:02,053 --> 00:16:04,146
on how to suppress this movement.

353
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:06,740
During the 24th session of the Hindu Mahasabha in Kanpur,

354
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,233
their party leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar

355
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,153
came up with another strategy.

356
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:15,294
The Hindu Mahasabha follows 
the strategy of responsive cooperation.

357
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:18,723
Not only did they intend to give 
unconditional cooperation to the British government,

358
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:21,515
they were also ready for active and armed resistance.

359
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:24,087
At that time, the Hindu Mahasabha was a political party

360
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:25,331
and at the organizational level,

361
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:29,504
RSS had the same response towards the Quit India Movement.

362
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:32,100
That's why the British intelligence agencies

363
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,084
described their stance as follows.

364
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:39,960
"The Sangh has scrupulously kept itself within the law,

365
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,942
and...refrained from taking part in the 
disturbances that broke out in August 1942."

366
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:48,000
While on one hand, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose formed the Azad Hind Fauj

367
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,318
a few months after the Quit India Movement,

368
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:52,071
On the other hand, Savarkar was helping the colonial government

369
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,909
recruit hundreds of thousands of Indians

370
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:56,948
in the British Armed Forces.

371
00:16:56,948 --> 00:16:59,320
These Indians joined the British Army

372
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,265
and fought against Subhash Chandra Bose's Azad Hind Fauj.

373
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:04,221
At that time, there was a man named Narayan Apte

374
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,164
who joined the British Army

375
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:09,805
and later on, became a recruiter for 
the British Royal Indian Air Force.

376
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,763
Later on, he was found guilty

377
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:14,547
for being involved in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.

378
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:18,040
Along with that, Nathuram Godse's 
brother, Gopal Godse

379
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,101
was also fighting this war on the British side.

380
00:17:20,101 --> 00:17:23,029
Savarkar had said some more things 
about the Quit India Movement.

381
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:25,173
That this type of unscrupulous rebellion 

382
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:27,190
did not deserve any sympathy.

383
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,638
This was a huge insult to the freedom fighters

384
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:33,527
who were actually fighting 
against the British at that time.

385
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:37,054
And that is why, after hearing this, Netaji 
Subhash Chandra Bose could not remain silent.

386
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:38,967
On 14th August 1942,

387
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:42,339
in Berlin, he sent a message through the radio.

388
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:45,964
"I would request Mr. Jinnah, Mr. Savarkar, and all those leaders

389
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,894
who still think of a compromise with the British

390
00:17:48,894 --> 00:17:52,194
to realise (that).... in the world of tomorrow 
there will be no British Empire."

391
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:55,582
A senior leader of Hindu Mahasabha, N.C. Chatterjee wrote,

392
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:56,958
"It is rather amusing to find

393
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,631
that Mr. Jinnah wants

394
00:17:58,631 --> 00:18:02,008
the Muslims to not join the Congress movement

395
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:04,415
and Mr. Savarkar wants

396
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,945
Hindus not to join the same."

397
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:07,634
Despite all this opposition, friends,

398
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:10,779
the Quit India Movement was successful.

399
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:13,706
The world started talking about India's freedom.

400
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:17,727
The then American President Roosevelt 
also put pressure on the UK government

401
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,064
to fulfil some of India's demands.

402
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:25,908
Even in Britain, the British people were 
demanding that India be given freedom.

403
00:18:25,908 --> 00:18:30,164
In June 1945, the British Labour Party 
released its new manifesto.

404
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:31,863
Let Us Face The Future.

405
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:33,689
They made a promise to the British people

406
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:35,752
that if they came into power

407
00:18:35,752 --> 00:18:39,521
then they would give complete freedom to colonies like India.

408
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:43,281
Next month, in 1945, the Labour Party came to power in Britain

409
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:46,202
and the new Prime Minister was Clement Attlee.

410
00:18:46,202 --> 00:18:48,027
And he openly declared that

411
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:51,560
it was time to give India self-governance.

412
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,728
As soon as the government changed in Britain,

413
00:18:53,728 --> 00:18:57,283
the arrested Congress leaders 
were released from jail in India.

414
00:18:57,283 --> 00:19:02,338
And two years after that, the struggle that 
our Indian freedom fighters started years ago,

415
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:04,023
became successful.

416
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:07,240
India got complete freedom.

417
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:18,772
Although it was clear by 1945 that

418
00:19:18,772 --> 00:19:20,857
India's freedom was inevitable,

419
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:23,979
in 1946, two other important things happened,

420
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:27,376
which increased the importance of freedom.

421
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,712
First, the INA soldiers' court-martial,

422
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:31,061
also known as the INA trials,

423
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:34,068
and second, the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny.

424
00:19:34,068 --> 00:19:37,396
Let's talk about these in detail in another video.

425
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:38,911
For now, if you liked this video,

426
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,808
you can go and watch this video,

427
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:42,993
in which I have explained in detail

428
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:44,903
why India's partition happened.

429
00:19:44,903 --> 00:19:47,234
Who were the people and what were the incidents

430
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:49,202
that led to the partition?

431
00:19:49,202 --> 00:19:50,720

432
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,797
Thank you very much!
