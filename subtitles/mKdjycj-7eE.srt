1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,801
- Sitting on these train tracks

2
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:03,870
is a quarter million dollar Lamborghini.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,372
And barreling down at it

4
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,474
right now is a massive train.

5
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,410
But before the impact, I'm
giving this Lamborghini to Blake.

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,244
- Thank you.

7
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,379
- And on top of sending the train,

8
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,647
I'm also gonna have these eight soldiers

9
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:17,384
shoot 10,000 bullets at your Lamborghini.

10
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:18,818
- That's the scariest
thing I've ever seen.

11
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,053
- Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

12
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,256
- And you have exactly 24 hours
to build whatever you want

13
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,325
to protect your Lambo from the bullets.

14
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,426
The timer starts now.

15
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,927
- Okay, first line of defense,

16
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,530
I'm thinking a wall of
cinder blocks, after that

17
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,632
some shipping containers
filled with refrigerators

18
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,868
and then basically just a wall of cars

19
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,302
to block those bullets.

20
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,737
- Do you think
all of this is enough

21
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,305
to stop 10,000 bullets?

22
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,507
- I think it is, Jimmy.

23
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,409
- Okay, but so
far nothing's there.

24
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,243
You should get to building.

25
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,844
- So Blake immediately
drove to three stores

26
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,613
where I gave him my credit card

27
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,549
and he literally spent
$78,000 on supplies.

28
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,018
And since I don't wanna bore
you with all that, let's skip

29
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,553
to the part where
everything was delivered.

30
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,722
This first round of supplies
are starting to show up.

31
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,624
- Oh my God, I can't believe
I bought all this stuff.

32
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,925
And this isn't even everything, man.

33
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,093
- He's got a water truck.

34
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,795
Some of his junk cars came in.

35
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,696
He's got a CONEX crate over here.

36
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,432
How did he get this much
stuff? This is crazy.

37
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,101
Don't worry about the guys
with the machine guns.

38
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,302
Just pretend they're not there.

39
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,037
Yeah, I don't even know what

40
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,072
they're doing there, honestly.

41
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,174
- We're five hours in and
this storage container

42
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,675
is about to be the first line of defense

43
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:16,743
against 10,000 bullets.

44
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,446
- Alright, that's probably
good. That's probably good.

45
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,714
Do you think that shipping container's

46
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:22,549
gonna stop any bullets?

47
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,383
- Absolutely not.

48
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,119
- So as of now, he's screwed.

49
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,387
- Yeah, it's not looking good for him.

50
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,221
- Oh gosh.

51
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,423
It's been about six hours. Are
you happy with your progress?

52
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,558
- I'm very happy.
- You sure?

53
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,493
- It wasn't until this thing got down,

54
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,228
but now that it's down,
dude, I feel really good.

55
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,263
- I asked him if this
would stop the bullets

56
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,798
and they said no.

57
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,568
And once Blake realized
he had to go all out,

58
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,336
he works not only through the night

59
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,105
This way, Mr. Railroad ties.

60
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,773
- Nice, nice. Yes.

61
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,007
- Really nice. Really nice.

62
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,776
- But even into the next morning,

63
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,111
upgrading his defense-

64
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,346
- Dude, he's stuffing the
storage container with a van

65
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,380
and a giant tube!

66
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,982
- And once I saw it put together,

67
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,650
I was honestly pretty impressed.

68
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,985
Run me through what you built.

69
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,854
- So I built a whole
bunch of concrete in the front

70
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,856
and the tallest part of the
wall is right in the center

71
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,491
to block the crow's nest machine guns

72
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,892
'cause those things are big and scary.

73
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,560
- I got all my cars in storage containers

74
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,495
and a bunch of water.

75
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,363
- And if you come right over here,

76
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,700
you'll see his Lamborghini
tucked away amongst everything.

77
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,301
- There it is. Nice and cozy.

78
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,904
- Do you think all of
this will stop the bullets?

79
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,339
- Yeah, I do.

80
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,674
I think you have a 50% chance of survival.

81
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,176
- That's the best odds I've had yet.

82
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,245
- And before I have
them shoot 10,000 rounds,

83
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,846
come with me to the Lamborghini.

84
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,548
Not only are you competing
for this Lamborghini,

85
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,316
but for a hundred grand as well.

86
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,851
- What?
- Yes sir.

87
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,286
- Yeah, that's pretty cool, huh?

88
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,822
- This will be enough to cover
the insurance.

89
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,457
24 hours is up!

90
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,727
Eight scary men, 10,000 bullets-

91
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,662
- Versus everything
that Blake has built...

92
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,530
- Are you ready?

93
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,199
- Just get it over with. I'm freaking out.

94
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,768
- We're locked and loaded.
Ready to fire on you, Jimmy.

95
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:52,005
- Sir, fire at will.
- Roger that.

96
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,039
- Standby!

97
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,174
Fire!

98
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,277
- Oh!
- Oh my god!

99
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,347
- They are unloading on his fortress.

100
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,716
- Oh my God! This is crazy!

101
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,252
- They're actually ripping through

102
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,253
the cinder blocks now.

103
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,091
- Oh man. Oh god.

104
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:15,061
- Oh, Blake's walls
are crumbling right now!

105
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,700
And what we haven't told
Blake is these guns are only

106
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,236
the first of four phases we've designed

107
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,704
to destroy this Lamborghini,

108
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,740
or should I say whatever
remains after this?

109
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,710
- They just brought up the LMG.

110
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,584
- Oh, whoa!

111
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,354
- Oh, it's melting!

112
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:43,957
- No!

113
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,427
Cinder blocks are falling!

114
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,261
- Ah!

115
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,697
- All it takes is
one bullet to penetrate

116
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,265
and it's going in his Lambo.

117
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,101
- Oh my God!

118
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,174
- These are the last bullets.

119
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,278
- Ten thousand!

120
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,680
- All clear? Let's go.

121
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,549
Please be safe. Please be safe.

122
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,418
How is it?!

123
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,820
- She's clean, baby!

124
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,992
- Whoo! 10,000 rounds and
not one connection baby.

125
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,294
- There's no bullet holes
in your Lamborghini.

126
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,329
And if you don't already
know who Blake is,

127
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,632
he's actually a contestant
from our previous two videos.

128
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,600
But today he's back for a third

129
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,336
and final attempt to win the grand prize.

130
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,304
- Are you ready for phase two?

131
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,138
- Yes.

132
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,740
- See that giant crane coming?

133
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,675
- That big yellow oil rig looking thing?

134
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,043
- That is phase two.

135
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,646
That crane is going to lift
your car up a hundred feet

136
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,414
and then in 24 hours drop it.

137
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,117
And you have to catch it
without it being destroyed.

138
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:45,918
- Seriously?

139
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,920
- Yeah. Alright, bring it over here!

140
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,423
And while we prepared the
world's first 100 foot

141
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,557
Lamborghini free fall...

142
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,226
- There goes your Lamborghini, Blake!

143
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:56,195
Blake began to strategize on
how he was going to catch it.

144
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,163
- I have no idea what I'm gonna do.

145
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,064
- Chandler, come over here.

146
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:58,898
- Yes, I'm here.

147
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,866
- How would you break its fall?

148
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,501
- So you get all the pillows in the city.

149
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,604
Step two, get all the
mattresses, next, get a blanket.

150
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,272
- Chandler, you're just
making a giant bed.

151
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,573
- Then a warm glass of milk...

152
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:08,841
- All right, stop. You're not helping.

153
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,176
Blake, work your magic.

154
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,110
- I'm screwed.

155
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,279
- Alright guys, I got some
good news and bad news.

156
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,847
We passed day one with flying colors.

157
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,283
The bad news is the
Lamborghini is airborne.

158
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,652
Okay? So anyone got any ideas?

159
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,055
I mean, yeah, hit me,
like what do we think?

160
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,023
- The bouncy castles.
- Bouncy castles.

161
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,425
That that's actually not that bad.

162
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,227
Just because...that's
not bad at all really.

163
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,429
- And after being inspired

164
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,064
by the construction worker's wisdom,

165
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,066
Blake had decided on his master plan.

166
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,802
- I would like to move the
CONEXes in like a square,

167
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,437
right here with the X in the middle.

168
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,439
And that way I can just fill
the square up with a bunch

169
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,941
of air mattresses, pillows, bubble wrap,

170
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,043
and on top it all off with
a bunch of bouncy castles.

171
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,046
Just the biggest problem right
now is I have no material.

172
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:50,450
Everything that I bought
is hard, concrete or metal.

173
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,819
And nothing that I bought
I can use for day two.

174
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,153
So, I have absolutely nothing.

175
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,389
- And so Blake sent his
crew to buy every pillow

176
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,623
and air mattress in the city.

177
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,826
And even though he was
incredibly sleep deprived,

178
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:00,660
he got to work.

179
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,595
- I'm already at the stage
where it's like, "Wait,

180
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,896
why am I doing this again?"

181
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,199
Oh yeah, that's right. I'm in
a challenge for a Lamborghini

182
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,734
that's floating in the sky right now.

183
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,602
- By the time his
materials had arrived,

184
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,804
Blake had been awake for over 24 hours

185
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,606
and was in desperate need of sleep.

186
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,574
- I'm gonna try to get some sleep

187
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,709
'cause I'm exhausted and
it's four in the morning.

188
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,444
- And with how exhausted Blake was,

189
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,147
he ended up sleeping for
way longer than he planned.

190
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,583
Blake!

191
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,184
Is he serious?

192
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,119
- What is this?

193
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,321
He got mattresses, pillows, and blankets.

194
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,022
But he's missing the warm milk.

195
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,624
- Yeah, that's the key to everything.

196
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,725
- Where is Blake?

197
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,993
- He's asleep. I heard.

198
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,027
- No, he is not.

199
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,629
- By the time Blake got on site,

200
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,664
it was already super late in the day.

201
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:39,832
- That's Blake's truck pulling up.

202
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,968
Alright, we need to get to work. Come on!

203
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,503
- Alright, let's just
see what this looks like.

204
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,539
Oh, that bouncy house works as a big box.

205
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,208
So I'm thinking maybe we put
that thing in the middle now

206
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,877
and then we start blowing it up.

207
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,779
- Only four and a half hours remain

208
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,213
and it's not looking good for Blake.

209
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,282
I don't think he has
more than a 10% chance

210
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,350
of catching a Lamborghini.

211
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,385
- And even if he does,
there's no shot he's stopping

212
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,319
that train later on.

213
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,289
- Start filling up the side so
that way it's high over here,

214
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,757
takes away this wall.

215
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,826
- So with only a
couple of hours remaining,

216
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,629
Blake did all that he could
by filling the rest of his pit

217
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,464
with cardboard boxes and bubble wrap.

218
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,932
- It's coming down to the wire.

219
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,168
Chandler, how much time is left?

220
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,736
- One hour.

221
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,470
- Blake is screwed.

222
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,704
- I have a little bit of bubble wrap left.

223
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,339
I think I'm just gonna
get raised on this thing

224
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,108
and just wrap my baby
up in this bubble wrap

225
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:22,942
and I'm good to go.

226
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,210
- That's definitely gonna help.

227
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,212
- Blake spent what little
time he had remaining

228
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,881
on this crane, failing at
trying to bubble wrap his car.

229
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,416
- It's just not gonna work.

230
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,651
- You know what time it is?

231
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,485
- What?

232
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,154
- Time to drop the car.
Let's drop this by boy.

233
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,258
The failed bubble wrap
makes it look majestic.

234
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,727
Blake, do you think your
Lamborghini will survive?

235
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:42,762
- I'm positive, Jimmy.

236
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,330
- He is more certain than me.

237
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,231
- I'm positive about this one.

238
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,033
I bought every air mattress at Walmart.

239
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,801
If this won't catch it,
I don't know what will.

240
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,036
I did everything I can.

241
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,871
- Here's a Feastables bar, Blake.

242
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:52,839
- Ah, thank you Mr.

243
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,673
- That way even if you lose the car,

244
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,541
at least you have some good chocolate.

245
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,777
It's available at Walmart. Be
sure to go try our new bar.

246
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,011
I'm so curious what you think.

247
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:03,483
But anyway, you have three
bouncy castles, 150 mattresses,

248
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,450
how many pillows?
- 150.

249
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:08,654
- 150 pillows and 2,000 cardboard boxes!

250
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,823
Will it break the Lamborghini's fall?

251
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,325
- Yes. Yes.

252
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,559
- That's two yeses.
- Okay.

253
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:17,430
- 24 hours of work, down
to this, no pun intended.

254
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,968
- 3, 2, 1. Drop the Lamborghini!

255
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,882
Here we go! Outta my way!

256
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,016
- That did not sound good.

257
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,085
- Please be okay.
Please be okay. Please be okay.

258
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:39,919
Please be okay.

259
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,320
- Alright. He's moving the
CONEX crate out the way.

260
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,456
- There's no way you caught that Lambo.

261
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,624
- Get these boxes outta the way!

262
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,225
- Whoa!
- What?

263
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,294
- We're about to find out
how damaged this car is.

264
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,128
- The lights work.

265
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,663
- Ooh, the lights work.

266
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,198
- Yeah. This princess castle might have

267
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,766
saved this entire car.

268
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:54,834
- Moment of truth.

269
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,936
You might've been the
first person in history

270
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,371
to catch a Lamborghini-

271
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,672
- If it turns on.

272
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,909
- Alright, here we go. Here we
go. Here we go.

273
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,411
Whoa, it works!

274
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,014
I can't believe it! Yay!

275
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,950
That's what I'm talking
about! She's alive!

276
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,120
- Everything looks good, minus
a little crack in the bumper,

277
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,355
which we found out via official appraiser.

278
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,291
This was only going to reduce the price

279
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,659
of Blake's Lamborghini by...

280
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,160
- Probably 10 grand.

281
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,994
- Thank you so much.
Thanks for the good news.

282
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,565
- Right now's the perfect time
to mention that Phase three

283
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,867
is flaming cars.

284
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,335
- For Blake's next challenge

285
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,404
we're bringing back his biggest nightmare.

286
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,839
We have recreated the
flaming cars challenge

287
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,175
that costed Blake everything last time.

288
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,144
- Wow, that's a low blow.

289
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,012
- But seeing that
he's done this before,

290
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,248
we're gonna up the
stakes by dropping twice

291
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,250
as many cars as last time.

292
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,452
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I got a lot to prove.

293
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:47,520
Redemption day!

294
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,855
- Blake spent the rest
of the night disassembling his

295
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,290
defense for phase two.

296
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,292
And after a good night
of sleep, he was ready

297
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,261
to begin his defense for phase three.

298
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,228
- It's eight in the morning.

299
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,631
Just woke up. We got a
lot of work to do today.

300
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,732
So let's get started.

301
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,167
- Here's the day three plan.

302
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,469
I'm gonna cut the bottom
out of a shipping container.

303
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,438
I'm gonna drop it right on the car.

304
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,139
Next I'm gonna take two more containers

305
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,075
and I'm gonna lead them up coming

306
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,776
to a point right above the car.

307
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,446
- And most importantly,
nothing flammable this time.

308
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,880
- Do you think that will deflect a car?

309
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,715
- Yes sir.

310
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,316
- Oh, I thought you were
gonna say no.

311
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,952
Blake then asked his crew to
remove every piece of wood

312
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,153
that was in the container

313
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,823
because that's what ended
his challenge last time.

314
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,125
He then had them cut out
the bottom of the container

315
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,660
that would surround the Lamborghini.

316
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,196
- The storage container
could put a lot of damage.

317
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,430
- Completely crush it?
- Yeah.

318
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,264
- It can?

319
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,734
- I mean, yeah, that
thing weighs a whole lot.

320
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,436
- And with that
being done, Blake just needs

321
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,905
to lower the container
carefully over the Lamborghini

322
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,340
without damaging it.

323
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,643
- One scratch can
cost some thousands of dollars.

324
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,710
You're good just like that?

325
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,712
- It is so close
to scraping the car.

326
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,115
- Watch your fingers.
We're coming down!

327
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,251
- Yes! Yes!

328
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,886
- I cannot believe that!

329
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,621
- Next we're gonna
bring these containers together

330
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,422
to form a "V".

331
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,257
- What if the car gets caught in there?

332
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,392
- Yeah, that's, that can't happen, dude.

333
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,761
That's why we're putting
this pointy thing at the top.

334
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,697
- Do you think that will
actually deflect our car?

335
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,698
- A hundred percent.

336
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,434
- 20 minutes remain and then
we see if that Lamborghini

337
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,070
perishes just like his 500 grand.

338
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,774
And as usual, Blake
utilized every last second.

339
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,109
3, 2, 1.

340
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,745
Not quite sure what
that dirt accomplished.

341
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,614
Time is up.
- No!

342
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,384
- Let's see if unlike last
time, you survive phase three.

343
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,686
- Redemption!

344
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,188
- Blake,

345
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,991
you lost $500,000 from
this exact challenge.

346
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,059
How are you feeling?

347
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,060
- I feel pretty confident.

348
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,062
- I think the viewers
wanna know one thing:

349
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,731
Did you put wood inside
of there like last time?

350
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:39,565
- A little bit.

351
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,033
No, I'm just kidding.
There's no wood in there.

352
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,401
It was one of the biggest mistakes

353
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,803
I've ever made in my life.

354
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,372
- Moment of truth. Come on in.

355
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,540
Three shipping containers.

356
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,842
A bunch of dirt, concrete,

357
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,378
a weird like, pointed roof thing.

358
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,513
Versus 10 flaming cars!

359
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,648
Are you ready?

360
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,582
- Let's go dude.

361
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,384
- Light it on fire!

362
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,620
- Will Blake be
one step closer to going home

363
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,322
with the new Lamborghini filled

364
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:07,359
with a hundred thousand
dollars or be eliminated

365
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,562
and go home with nothing?

366
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,263
- We're about to find out.

367
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,633
3, 2, 1.

368
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:15,534
Drop it!

369
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,570
- Oh!

370
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,606
- Oh, oh!

371
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:21,941
- Oh. You did not want that.

372
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,044
- I feel like that's exactly
what he didn't want to happen.

373
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,046
Oh no.

374
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,314
Still feeling good?

375
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,148
- Not as good.

376
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,250
- Yeah, this is giving me some flashbacks.

377
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,485
- It's giving you some flashbacks.

378
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,053
- Alright, ready for the next one?

379
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,821
- Let's do it. Let's do it.

380
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:36,655
- Drop it.

381
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,660
- Oh my God, the roof looks
like it's already buckling.

382
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,363
- And just in case Blake
loses the flaming cars

383
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,298
like last time, I'm gonna take this moment

384
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,134
and tell you about this amazing new phone.

385
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,769
What you're currently watching on is

386
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,438
the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra.

387
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,141
This phone can record slow-mo in 4K.

388
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,942
The camera on this is crazy.

389
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,111
We're like 200 feet
away and it's nighttime.

390
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,313
And look at that; crystal clear.

391
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:04,583
- Ho ho ho ho!
- And go ahead and drop it.

392
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,553
- Oh!

393
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,654
- Oh, that hurt to watch.

394
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,322
It also has a ton of new features

395
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,424
with Galaxy AI, like Photo Assist.

396
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,929
- Remember the last
challenge when the bumper

397
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:17,763
got cracked on the Lambo?

398
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,098
You can just circle it like this

399
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,033
and then all you do is you
hit that eraser button.

400
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,569
And just like that, the bumper is fixed.

401
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,637
- Now I have a new car.

402
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,838
- For the picture you do

403
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,474
- Whenever you're ready.

404
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,780
This phone also has
circle to search Google,

405
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,216
which makes finding
information incredibly easy.

406
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,819
It would've helped Blake
a lot in the last video

407
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,655
to learn about the flammability
of wooden railroad ties.

408
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,124
All he needed to do was
long press the home button,

409
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:49,628
highlight the railroad ties and
ask, "Is this flammable?"

410
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,531
- As you can see, railroad
ties are flammable.

411
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,466
- You would've learned
the answer instantly.

412
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,701
Could have just told you.

413
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,371
I was genuinely impressed

414
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,607
by this phone and I think you will be too.

415
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,043
So go to samsung.com, click
the link in the description

416
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,145
or scan this QR code to
check it out right now

417
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,546
and let's drop the next car.

418
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,085
- We dropped car after car,

419
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,753
and with each one we could tell Blake

420
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,690
was getting more nervous,
but we also noticed that all

421
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,991
of the impacts were starting

422
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,659
to damage the crate itself.

423
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,162
- Your crate on the bottom is bowing.

424
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,197
- At this point,
the container protecting

425
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,466
the Lambo was being crushed by the weight

426
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,801
and heat of the cars.

427
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,769
- I thought about this every day since

428
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:31,971
the last time I saw this.

429
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,206
- And now it's
time for the final car!

430
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,443
- Yes!

431
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,878
- Oh no!

432
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,881
- Bro, it's gotta be
a thousand degrees in there!

433
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,149
This car's probably melting right now.

434
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,451
- We got the fire extinguisher.

435
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,487
- Somehow he's running so
fast. Be careful, Blake.

436
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,156
- I'm coming.

437
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:51,991
- How is it?

438
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,960
- It's okay. It's okay!

439
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,264
Yes! You like that?

440
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,166
- If one more car was dropped, this crate

441
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,101
would've collapsed.

442
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,336
You stopped 10,000 bullets.
- Easy.

443
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,939
- You caught a car out of mid air.

444
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,575
You've now deflected ten flaming cars.

445
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,744
- Now its time for phase four.

446
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,112
- Bring on the train.

447
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,247
- The timer has officially started.

448
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,081
- I gotta go.

449
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,083
- Good luck on phase four.

450
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,018
- God speed.

451
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,419
- What is he even running at?

452
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,254
- Blake knew that the train was going

453
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,390
to be the most deadly attack yet,

454
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,059
so he wasted no time in getting started.

455
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,161
- I think the best way to
stop a train is to derail it.

456
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,396
That's what I've tried to build here.

457
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,064
All these railroad ties are tucked snug,

458
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,700
and all of these are
gonna go under the train.

459
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,135
The train's gonna hit 'em like that.

460
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,970
And if I do that a hundred more times,

461
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,439
I don't see the train just
blowing past all that.

462
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,242
The railroad ties lost me
the challenge last video.

463
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,476
This time they'll save me.

464
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,745
I just need two inches
off the track and I win.

465
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,147
- Two inches is a lot though.

466
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,081
- My man.

467
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,582
And then once I have all this done,

468
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,184
I can just put concrete on top.

469
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,486
I think that's gonna work,
man. I think that's gonna work.

470
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,121
- Blake worked
with his crew throughout

471
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,891
the entire night and when I
showed up the next morning,

472
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:02,027
it was obvious that this
challenge had taken a toll on him.

473
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:02,895
What's up, Jimbo?

474
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,163
- What happened to your voice?

475
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,764
- I'm like dying out here.

476
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,400
- As you guys know, he lost
$250,000 in this video.

477
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,936
He lost half a million
dollars in this video.

478
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,105
I think Blake is sick and tired of losing.

479
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,940
He has an army going super hard.

480
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,842
They're currently stacking the cars

481
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,678
that we dropped on phase
three on the train tracks.

482
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,814
But time was still ticking down.

483
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,883
And in order to stop this
train and take his Lambo home,

484
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,152
Blake began adding a lot more objects

485
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,955
to the tracks, like shipping
containers, mattresses

486
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,156
to cushion the impact...

487
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,492
- Blake's worked so hard.
I'm now on his team.

488
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,426
- And water tanks.

489
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,828
- Blake really seems to
know what he's doing.

490
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,529
Too bad, there's only 11 minutes left.

491
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,665
At this point, Blake
did everything he could

492
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,767
to finish his build before time ran out,

493
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,902
and it was actually
starting to look impressive.

494
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,738
- This is it.
- Three...

495
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,039
- The final stretch,

496
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,508
- Two, one.
- Last line of defense.

497
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,310
- Time's up. Stop. Turn it off.

498
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,011
Turn it off.

499
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,046
Time is officially up!

500
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,047
- Oh my God.

501
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,616
- From phase one
shipping containers, phase two's

502
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,452
mattresses, and even phase
three's burning cars.

503
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,521
Blake, you somehow used all the resources

504
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,189
from the previous phases.

505
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,325
- Let's see if you're
driving home in a Lamborghini

506
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,394
or if I'm dropping you off at your house.

507
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,262
- Bring that train on, man. Bring it on.

508
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,232
- Before we ram everything,
we need to back the train up.

509
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,533
We're gonna go really far back.

510
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,169
That way the train can
pick up a lot of speed

511
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,338
before it hits everything.
Sounds like a good idea?

512
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,539
- No, that sounds awful.

513
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,840
- Be honest, Blake. Do you think

514
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,042
your Lamborghini will survive?

515
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,309
- God, I hope so, Jimmy.

516
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,311
- And of course we had to
put the Feastables logo

517
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,146
on the train.

518
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,480
It's the best chocolate on earth.

519
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,783
Do yourself a favor and
try the new formula,

520
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,085
but for now, it's time
for the biggest moment

521
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,053
of Blake's life.

522
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,721
Let's see if he wins a Lamborghini.

523
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,989
Blake, any last words?

524
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,290
- Give it all you got.

525
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,692
- Send the train.

526
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,161
Here it comes.

527
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,896
- Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

528
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,730
- It's coming!

529
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,466
- It's gonna speed up
until it hits 35 miles an hour

530
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,967
right before impact.

531
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,202
- Dude, it is going quick!

532
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,237
- It's just gonna
derail. It's just gonna derail.

533
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,172
- Here she comes!

534
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,008
Let's see if it was all worth it!

535
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,925
- Oh, wait, wait, wait!

536
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,294
- Blake, it derailed!
- Wait, I think it stopped!

537
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,895
- Oh my God!

538
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,297
- Blake, I've never
seen someone this happy!

539
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,965
- Oh wow, you derailed it!

540
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,034
- Oh my God. Oh my God. I did it!

541
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,335
Oh!

542
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,873
Oh my God!

543
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,675
- This is your new Lamborghini, Blake!

544
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,677
Not only did he win the Lamborghini,

545
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,345
but he also got all this money!

546
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,213
- Yes!

547
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,147
- Congrats.

548
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,081
- I did it!

549
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,016
- You wanna know the best
way to end this video, Blake?

550
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:38,617
- What?

551
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,120
- By them going to Walmart and
buying Feastables right now.

552
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,088
It's the best tasty
chocolate on the planet.

553
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,957
Third time's the charm.
See you guys later!

554
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,391
- Yes!
