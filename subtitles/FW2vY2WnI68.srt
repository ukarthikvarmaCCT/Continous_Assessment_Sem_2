1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,129
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,129 --> 00:00:05,909
After 2011, it's time for India 
to host the Cricket World Cup again.

3
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:10,677
And I hope that we win again, 
just like we did last year.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,978
Because till now, the Indian 
cricket team has been in great form.

5
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:17,336
India has been dominating the World Cup with a series of impressive victories,

6
00:00:17,336 --> 00:00:20,208
leaving no other team in serious contention.

7
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:23,722
In this World Cup, the Indian 
cricket team broke several records.

8
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:29,422
In the match against Sri Lanka, the team 
achieved the historic victory in World Cup history,

9
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:32,952
bowling out the opposition with just 55 runs.

10
00:00:32,952 --> 00:00:35,559
And winning with a massive 302-run lead.

11
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,439
Mohammad Shammi set the record for 
the most 5-wicket hauls in World Cups

12
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,534
and becoming India's most 
successful bowler in World Cup history

13
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:49,371
with 45 wickets in just 14 matches.

14
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:53,821
The previous record was held by
Zahir Khan with 44 wickets in 23 matches.

15
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:58,684
In the recent semi-final match, 
he went on to break more records.

16
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,347
His standout performance included 7 wickets and 57 runs,

17
00:01:01,347 --> 00:01:06,691
marking the best individual performance 
by an Indian in ODI cricket history.

18
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,421
Additionally, he became the fastest bowler

19
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:14,107
to reach a 50-wicket haul in just 17 innings.

20
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:18,377
On the batting front, our top star batsmen,
Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli

21
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:21,629
accumulated nearly 1,300 runs together.

22
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:23,408
Rohit Sharma scored a century,

23
00:01:23,408 --> 00:01:24,892
while Kohli scored 3.

24
00:01:24,892 --> 00:01:27,814
Virat Kohli broke many records too.

25
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:31,496
He has now surpassed 50 ODI centuries,

26
00:01:31,496 --> 00:01:35,307
The only batsman in history to beat this record.

27
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:39,995
The previous record was held by 
Sachin Tendulkar at 49 ODI centuries.

28
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:42,313
Additionally, he broke another record held by Sachin.

29
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:45,657
Most runs made by any batsman in a World Cup.

30
00:01:45,657 --> 00:01:49,236
In the 2003 World Cup, Sachin Tendulkar set the record at 673 runs.

31
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:54,105
And Kohli has already scored 711 runs in this World Cup edition.

32
00:01:54,105 --> 00:01:57,957
Beyond India, the World Cup has seen other interesting records,

33
00:01:57,957 --> 00:02:03,456
including two highest run-scoring matches in this World Cup.

34
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,137
The first in the Sri Lanka v. South Africa game.

35
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:09,257
With a total of 754 runs.

36
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:11,582
And the Australia v. New Zealand game

37
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,505
with 771 runs.

38
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:16,750
And the historic match between Australia and Afghanistan.

39
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,751
In which, Glenn Maxwell broke multiple records.

40
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:24,487
Scoring 201 runs on 128 balls, not out,

41
00:02:24,487 --> 00:02:26,754
becoming the first non-opening batsman

42
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:28,711
to achieve a double century,

43
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:32,435
His partnership with the captain of the Australian team,

44
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:35,706
became the highest 8th wicket partnership

45
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:37,443
in the history of ODI cricket.

46
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:40,032
Australia had nearly lost the game

47
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:42,693
at one point they were playing at 91-7.

48
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:46,809
Glenn Maxwell singlehandedly delivered Australia from their precarious score,

49
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:49,403
and had the team qualify for the World Cup semi-finals.

50
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:52,637
Even though Afghanistan lost the match they had almost won,

51
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:57,087
Afghanistan's story stands out as 
one of the most intriguing in this World Cup,

52
00:02:57,087 --> 00:03:01,697
defeating three former World Cup-winning teams

53
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:03,778
England, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

54
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:05,846
Despite this being only the third time

55
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:08,470
that Afghanistan was participating in the World Cup.

56
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,443
And the previous two times that Afghanistan had played,

57
00:03:11,443 --> 00:03:14,755
They had won only a single match in both World Cups combined.

58
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:17,738
That was against Scotland in 2015.

59
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:20,682
How could Afghanistan's team accomplish this out of nowhere?

60
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:24,199
What is the reason behind the increasing popularity of cricket in Afghanistan?

61
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:28,750
What is the link between geopolitics and cricket?

62
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,458
Come, let's discuss some unheard stories in this video.

63
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:41,207
Today, cricket is the second most popular sport after football,

64
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:48,529
with an estimated 2.5 billion followers.

65
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:52,980
While around 3.5 billion people are football fans.

66
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,047
This number is significant, 
not merely due to India's large population,

67
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:58,813
as the cricket fan base is nearly double that of the Indian population,

68
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:01,564
and not every Indian is a cricket enthusiast.

69
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:05,548
The roots of cricket's popularity can 
be traced back to the British Empire.

70
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:10,787
International cricket has been governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC)

71
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:13,061
since its establishment in 1909.

72
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:16,651
Presently, 12 countries are full members of the ICC.

73
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:18,464
The 12 full ICC members are England, Australia,

74
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:20,769
South Africa, West Indies, New Zealand,

75
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,510
India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,

76
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,370
Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Ireland, and Afghanistan.

77
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,801
These countries share a history of colonization by the British,

78
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:32,987
contributing to the widespread popularity of cricket in these nations.

79
00:04:32,987 --> 00:04:37,185
Afghanistan stands out as an exception to some extent,

80
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:39,010
a topic we will delve into later in the video.

81
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,003
The 12 full members of the ICC

82
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:45,746
are the exclusive participants in Test cricket,

83
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:49,153
and the 10 teams participating in the ongoing World Cup

84
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:50,634
are from these 12,

85
00:04:50,634 --> 00:04:51,661
excluding Netherlands.

86
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:53,921
Unfortunately, West Indies, Zimbabwe, and Ireland

87
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:57,517
failed to qualify for this year's World Cup,

88
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:59,662
with Netherlands securing a spot instead.

89
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:02,902
The Netherlands is an associate member of the ICC,

90
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:06,537
The category of associate members is a tier below full membership.

91
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:10,701
There are a total of 94 associate member countries in the ICC.

92
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:13,650
The question arises: how did cricket gain popularity in the Netherlands,

93
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,964
a country untouched by British colonisation?

94
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:17,536
The Netherlands is a European country.

95
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:19,235
There are two major reasons for this.

96
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,033
First, the proximity to England,

97
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:25,751
with the British introducing cricket to the Netherlands in the early days.

98
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:28,421
The British citizens who had moved to the Netherlands.

99
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:31,237
And then the elite Dutch people, 
those from the upper class,

100
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:33,703
among them, cricket's popularity grew.

101
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:37,852
The second reason is that the Netherlands 
had colonised some Caribbean countries,

102
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:39,767
such as Suriname,

103
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:43,686
when immigrants from those regions moved to the Netherlands post-World War II

104
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:45,874
further fueled cricket's popularity there.

105
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:47,873
However, it's essential to note that

106
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:52,866
games like football and field hockey 
are more popular than cricket in the Netherlands.

107
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:55,560
Although their team did qualify for the World Cup,

108
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,699
but cricket is not very popular in the Netherlands.

109
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:02,952
Shifting our focus to India, 1721 was the year

110
00:06:02,952 --> 00:06:05,102
when the first recorded cricket match took place.

111
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:11,073
This match was played by sailors of the 
East India Company in Khambath, Gujarat.

112
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:15,232
Cricket reached Australia by the late 1700s,

113
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:18,569
while New Zealand and South Africa saw its advent

114
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:20,613
only during the early 1800s.

115
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:25,149
Ironically, while England propagated cricket to so many countries,

116
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:27,915
many colonized nations

117
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:30,851
won the Cricket World Cup before England.

118
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:35,291
With the West Indies securing the title 
in the first cricket World Cup held in 1975

119
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,339
and also in 1979.

120
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:44,240
And it was in the third World Cup 
that India claimed its victory in 1983.

121
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,631
Countries like Australia, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka 
have won the World Cup at least once.

122
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:52,490
But it was only in 2019,

123
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,321
that England won the World Cup trophy for the first time.

124
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:59,695
Winning reminds me, if you want to win in your life,

125
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:03,325
in your job, your career, your studies, or in a sport,

126
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:07,514
the number one thing that you need to win at anything,

127
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:09,000
is discipline.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,802
Focusing on your goal while maintaining your self control,

129
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:15,437
being consistent everyday.

130
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:18,666
But most of us fail at these simple things.

131
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,759
Instead of focusing on our work, we waste our time

132
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,407
scrolling on our phones.

133
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:26,414
I did this too.

134
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:30,085
But then I developed my new system of time management. 

135
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:32,716
With this, I have become so disciplined that

136
00:07:32,716 --> 00:07:37,131
I can consistently produce these
high-quality videos every single week.

137
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:39,619
All while travelling the world,

138
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,505
and making travel vlogs.

139
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:44,828
So that you can bring discipline to your life using this system,

140
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:47,851
I have made this time management course for you.

141
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:51,266

Many of them found it to be life-changing.

144
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,254
Enrol in it to experience this.

145
00:07:58,254 --> 00:08:01,644
I'm sure that you will see a substantial change in your life.

And now, let's get back to our topic.

154
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:24,372
The memorable 2019 Cricket World Cup final match

155
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:27,150
most cricket fans would still remember this,

156
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,252
it was so thrilling,

157
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:30,554
And England's win in the Super Over

158
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:32,787
was quite controversial. 

159
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:35,828
Because technically, even the Super Over culminated in a tie.

160
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:38,263
In this match between England and New Zealand,

161
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:41,147
both teams had scored 15 runs in the Super Over.

162
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:43,626
According to the rules,
since the Super Over was a tie,

163
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:46,482
the team that scored more boundaries in the match

164
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,943
was declared the winner of the match.

165
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:52,068
And in this year's World Cup, England was the fourth-worst team.

166
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:54,657
England could win only 3 out of the 9 matches it played.

167
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:59,466
Afghanistan's cricket team ranked 
higher than England, boasting four wins.

168
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:03,170
This is the intriguing story of the Afghanistan cricket team.

169
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,329
Some years ago, in 2007,

170
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:08,858
when India won the T20 Cricket World Cup,

171
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:14,483
the ICC classified Afghanistan in the lowest division.

172
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:15,555
Division 5.

173
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,953
This was the worst division of ICC's associate members.

174
00:09:18,953 --> 00:09:24,856
However, the tide turned for Afghanistan with 
the rising popularity of T20 cricket that year.

175
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:29,470
In September 2007, after India won the first T20 World Cup,

176
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,738
the next month, the Asian Cricket Council organized its T20 Cup,

177
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:37,255
featuring 10 Asian associate teams,

178
00:09:37,255 --> 00:09:38,824
Hong Kong, Kuwait, Malaysia,

179
00:09:38,824 --> 00:09:40,417
Nepal, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,

180
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,922
Singapore, the UAE, and Afghanistan.

181
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:45,851
Afghanistan won three out of four group-stage games,

182
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,250
defeated the UAE in the semi-finals,

183
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,374
and played the finals against Oman.

184
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:52,871
In the final match, both teams tied.

185
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:56,920
Oman and Afghanistan shared the trophy.

186
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,187
For the Afghan people, this trophy meant a lot.

187
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:05,856
This marked the first victory of the 
Afghanistan cricket team in any tournament. 

188
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,662
This marked a turning point for Afghanistan.

189
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:11,857
In 2008, they secured victory in the ICC World Cricket League

190
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:13,234
this was the Division 5 league,

191
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:15,708
followed by triumphs in the Division 4 league in 2008

192
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:19,701
and the Division 3 league in 2009.

193
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:22,371
In just six years,

194
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:26,046
they qualified for their first World Cup in 2015.

195
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:30,177
The journey, however, was arduous for the Afghanis.

196
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:35,590
As I mentioned before, Afghanistan is the 
only exception among British-colonized countries.

197
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,308
Some parts of Afghanistan were colonized by the British,

198
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:42,227
during a certain period in time,

199
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:46,186
but the British could not occupy the entire country.

200
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:51,209
Cricket wasn't historically popular in Afghanistan.

201
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:56,956
In December 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded the country,

202
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,362
thousands of Afghanis fled towards Pakistan.

203
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:05,243
It was in the refugee camps at Peshawar,

204
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:07,693
that these Afghani boys encountered cricket.

205
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:11,338
The people in the refugee camps saw the Pakistanis playing cricket.

206
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,481
And they started playing too.

207
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:18,276
Initially, using sticks as bats

208
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:19,937
and since they had no balls,

209
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:22,937
they would roll the plastic bags as balls.

210
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:24,671
Some years later, in 1992,

211
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:29,287
Pakistan won the World Cup for the first time
under the leadership of Imran Khan.

212
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,165
This victory was an inspiration for these Afghan refugees.

213
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:44,582
This is why, in 2015, when Afghanistan played its first World Cup,

214
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:48,648
many of the team members, were from those refugee camps.

215
00:11:48,648 --> 00:11:51,987
Including the 2015 opening batsman Karim Sadiq,

216
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:55,751
who spent his childhood in Pakistan's Kacha Kara camp.

217
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:58,574
There he worked in a factory at night,

218
00:11:58,574 --> 00:12:00,163
and played cricket in the mornings.

219
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:03,925
The Afghanistan cricket team in the 2023 World Cup,

220
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:06,695
can be considered the second-generation players.

221
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:10,279
11 of the 15 players are younger than 25 years.

222
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:13,782
The assistant coach, Raees Ahmadzai,

223
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:15,885
is a former player,

224
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:19,492
recounting how he learned to play cricket as a refugee.

225
00:12:19,492 --> 00:12:23,613
He emphasizes that this new generation 
of the Afghanistan cricket team,

226
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:27,554
is the product of their training in Afghanistan.

227
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:29,479
After the Soviet's rule in Afghanistan ended

228
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:31,292
Taliban rose to power.

229
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,058
This had a major impact on their cricket.

230
00:12:34,058 --> 00:12:38,510
Basically, one can say that cricket could flourish in Afghanistan

231
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,665
because Taliban didn't interfere in this sport.

232
00:12:41,665 --> 00:12:45,585
When Taliban established their control in 1994,

233
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:47,337
they banned all sports.

234
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:49,283
Except cricket.

235
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:52,131
Cricket was acceptable to the Taliban because

236
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:54,082
it was a non-contact sport.

237
00:12:54,082 --> 00:12:57,324
There was no contact between the players,

238
00:12:57,324 --> 00:13:01,558
and the players didn't wear shorts like they do in football.

239
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:05,208
However, the situation has drastically 
changed during the ensuing 30 years.

240
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,241
The national flag that is represented by Afghanistan's team,

241
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:11,420
and the national anthem they sing before each match,

242
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,645
neither of them holds official status.

243
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:18,563
After the 2021 Taliban take over in Afghanistan,

244
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:21,149
they introduced a new national flag,

245
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:22,825
this white flag.

246
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:25,974
After their resurgence, the conditions have only worsened,

247
00:13:25,974 --> 00:13:29,146
with 90% of the Afghan population living in poverty

248
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:31,079
the financial conditions are terrible,

249
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,976
on top of it, in the past 20 months

250
00:13:32,976 --> 00:13:35,764
10 major earthquakes have hit Afghanistan.

251
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:39,490
Thousands of people have been displaced or have lost their lives.

252
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,412
And the most extreme earthquake hit last month, on 7th October.

253
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:46,645
"The death toll from an earthquake in Western Afghanistan 

254
00:13:46,645 --> 00:13:50,371
has risen to around 320 
with 1,000 more injured."

255
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:53,998
This is why the biggest cricket star in Afghanistan, Rashid Khan, 

256
00:13:53,998 --> 00:14:01,235
donated his entire tournament fees from 
this World Cup to the earthquake victims.

257
00:14:01,235 --> 00:14:04,909
He says that people pray for them back home. 

258
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:08,568
They watch their matches hoping that they will win.

259
00:14:08,568 --> 00:14:12,830
Because cricket is now the only source of joy in Afghanistan. 

260
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,577
The restrictions Taliban has placed on women,

261
00:14:16,577 --> 00:14:18,785
and the atrocities committed by them,

262
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:21,756
hardly any place on Earth is as restrictive as it is.

263
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:23,873
Women are confined to their homes

264
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:27,674
and prohibited from working or studying,

265
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:31,243
Thankfully, Afghanistan's men's cricket team has the opportunity

266
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:33,467
to participate in the World Cup.

267
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:36,296
However, the women's cricket team

268
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:38,908
is now refugees in Australia,

269
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:42,151
they are still struggling in their pursuit of playing opportunities.

270
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:48,453
Last year, Rashid Khan expressed solidarity with 
the daughters and sisters of Afghanistan,

271
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:55,598
advocating for the reversal of the decision 
to ban girls from high schools and universities.

272
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:58,112
"Every day of education wasted,

273
00:14:58,112 --> 00:15:01,103
is a day wasted from the future of the country."

274
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:04,542
For Afghani cricketers, cricket is not merely a sport.

275
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:07,449
This is a means to fight the circumstances.

276
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:11,599
Sometimes against the Soviet invasion.
sometimes against Taliban's oppressions.

277
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:15,957
The Afghani players do not hesitate to express their opinions.

278
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,491
Last month, after defeating Pakistan,

279
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:20,633
the team celebrated the victory.

280
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:23,639
Afghan Captain Hasmatullah Shahidi

281
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,176
dedicated the victory to Afghan refugees,

282
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:31,674
particularly those escaping Taliban 
rule and seeking refuge in Pakistan.

283
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:35,577
Whom Pakistan is forcefully sending back to Afghanistan. 

284
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:38,837
"Islamabad has ordered all undocumented immigrants,

285
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:42,511
which includes around 1.7 million Afghan nationals,

286
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:43,722
to leave the country."

287
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:47,129
The game of cricket emerges as 
a potential avenue for diplomatic relations.

288
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:51,085
When Afghanistan attained full membership in the ICC,

289
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:58,004
their inaugural test match was against India in Bangalore.

290
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:01,450
The Afghanistani President Ashraf Ghani was invited to India

291
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:03,561
to watch this first test match.

292
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,828
Similarly, during the 2011 World Cup,

293
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:11,495
Dr Manmohan Singh extended an invitation to 
then Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani

294
00:16:11,495 --> 00:16:13,913
to watch the India v. Pakistan match,

295
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:17,384
aiming to ease tensions between the two countries.

296
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:20,782
A similar initiative occurred in 2004 when

297
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:23,207
the Indian cricket team visited Pakistan,

298
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:25,736
leading both nations to relax visa regulations,

299
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:29,771
allowing the public to attend matches in these countries.

300
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:33,253
These instances underscore the profound impact of cricket's popularity

301
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:36,849
in fostering positive relations globally.

302
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:41,438
Consequently, there is a need to promote this sport in other countries,

303
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:45,541
encouraging both small and large 
nations to take an interest in cricket.

304
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:49,921
Unfortunately, the current state of the sport

305
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:52,642
reveals a concentration of control in 
the hands of only three major countries,

306
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,233
with India holding the strongest influence.

307
00:16:56,233 --> 00:17:00,243
While the ICC theoretically comprises 12 full members

308
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:02,069
and 94 associate countries,

309
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:04,281
this is just the theoritical model.

310
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:05,799
The practical reality is that ICC

311
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:13,261
is controlled by the BCCI, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), and Cricket Australia (CA).

312
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:16,614
These three nations are often referred to as the Big Three.

313
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:19,708
The consolidation of power escalated after February 2014 when

314
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:23,138
the ICC implemented structural and financial reforms,

315
00:17:23,138 --> 00:17:26,089
granting India, England, and Australia nearly

316
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,291
complete control over cricket's governance.

317
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:33,760
This power shift extended to the Big Three controlling the flow of money.

318
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,646
Out of ICC's total projected gross revenue of $2.5 billion,

319
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:43,709
the BCCI received a significant share of $570 million or 22.8%.

320
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:48,146
England and Australia obtained $143 million and $132 million,

321
00:17:48,146 --> 00:17:50,727
constituting 5.7% and 5.2% shares, respectively.

322
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:54,857
This distribution left associate members with minimal financial support.

323
00:17:54,857 --> 00:18:00,728
The Big Three argued that the funds invested in 
cricket development in associate countries

324
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:03,034
did not yield satisfactory returns,

325
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:05,219
prompting a reduction in financial support.

326
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:09,236
Fortunately, in 2017, this model was repealed,

327
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:10,821
and a new model was introduced.

328
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:12,892
When the voting took place for the new model,

329
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,965
13 votes were in favour, and only one vote dissented,

330
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:18,572
this dissenting vote was cast by the BCCI.

331
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:19,552
Why?

332
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:20,758
Because, under this new model,

333
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:26,574
BCCI's share would be reduced from $570 million to $293 million.

334
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:30,259
A share cut from 22% to 11%.

335
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,505
Concurrently, associate countries were

336
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:34,642
allocated $280 million

337
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:38,645
to stimulate growth in cricket in regions where

338
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:40,716
the sport isn't very popular yet.

339
00:18:40,716 --> 00:18:43,581
Regrettably, this model endured for only six years.

340
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,752
This year, another model was passed,

341
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:51,105
granting BCCI complete financial control over international cricket.

342
00:18:51,105 --> 00:18:54,246
In July, the ICC approved a new revenue system,

343
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:58,957
where full members will receive an 88.8% share of revenue

344
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:01,654
between 2024 and 2027.

345
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:04,238
Over the next three years, ICC's earnings are expected to be

346
00:19:04,238 --> 00:19:07,103
around $600 million annually,

347
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:10,954
with BCCI receiving $230 million.

348
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:13,337
Around 38.5%.

349
00:19:13,337 --> 00:19:18,058
The associate teams would receive 11% combined.

350
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:20,233
And the other full members

351
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:23,053
would get a share in the single digits.

352
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:25,390
The rationale behind this new revenue system is

353
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,154
the same as the one in 2014

354
00:19:27,154 --> 00:19:31,174
that BCCI significantly contributes commercially to cricket.

355
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:35,798
Given that most advertisers and the IPL are India-centric, 

356
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:39,433
85% of commercial weightage is attributed to BCCI.

357
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:43,777
This signifies that BCCI's contribution to the 
cricket economy ranges from 70% to 80%.

358
00:19:43,777 --> 00:19:48,211
Notably, the biggest contributor to this cricket economy is the IPL,

359
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:50,409
commonly referred to as the Cash Cow.

360
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:54,479
I have separate videos on IPL and 
T20 cricket, you can watch them too.

361
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:57,613
If you want to understand the business model of T20 model.

362
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,218
In that video, I explained how the World Cup works.

363
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:04,671
In the midst of these, there is positive news about cricket's popularity

364
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:08,856
it will soon be included in the Olympics.

365
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:13,440
This development is expected to introduce the sport to new audiences.

366
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,563
Curiously, cricket's absence from the Olympics until now

367
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:19,314
can also be attributed to the BCCI's resistance.

368
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,961
One might wonder why the BCCI opposed taking cricket to the Olympics,

369
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:30,648
given that it would enhance India's chances of winning another gold medal.

370
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:34,286
The BCCI's objection has consistently centered around the fear

371
00:20:34,286 --> 00:20:36,114
of losing member autonomy

372
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:38,046
in the face of the International Olympic Committee.

373
00:20:38,046 --> 00:20:43,354
Essentially, a concern that their control over the ICC would be diluted.

374
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:47,812
With the inclusion of the International Olympic Committee in the equation. 

375
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:51,854
Deciding match schedules and redistribution of financial costs,

376
00:20:51,854 --> 00:20:54,177
would no longer be within BCCI's purview

377
00:20:54,177 --> 00:20:56,548
once cricket would be played in the Olympics.

378
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,949
In the 2007 cricket World Cup

379
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:00,620
16 teams had participated.

380
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,037
The was reduced to 14 in 2011,

381
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:06,173
and further dwindled to 10 teams in 2019.

382
00:21:06,173 --> 00:21:08,274
Do you know why?

383
00:21:08,274 --> 00:21:09,595
Money.

384
00:21:09,595 --> 00:21:13,056
As fewer teams mean more matches for India,

385
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:17,447
translating into increased revenue for the BCCI.

386
00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:23,275
Not only the BCCI, the England 
Cricket Board (ECB) supported this too. 

387
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:29,303
The ECB articulated concerns that if cricket 
matches are held for 2-2.5 weeks in the Olympics,

388
00:21:29,303 --> 00:21:31,701
fewer matches would be played in England,

389
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:34,340
resulting in revenue loss.

390
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,568
However, cricket has been played at the Olympics once.

391
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:40,493
123 years ago,

392
00:21:40,493 --> 00:21:42,572
in the 1900 Paris Olympics,

393
00:21:42,572 --> 00:21:46,025
where only two cricket teams participated,

394
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:47,627
and only one match was played.

395
00:21:47,627 --> 00:21:49,689
Between Great Britain and France.

396
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:54,129
After this, during the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur

397
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:56,847
a full ODI tournament was included.

398
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:59,361
It had 16 participating teams,

399
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:03,023
culminated in South Africa winning the gold medal in this tournament.

400
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:04,521
Australia was in the second spot,

401
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:06,570
with the silver medal,

402
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,807
when the Australian cricket team captain Steve Waugh had said that

403
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:13,431
winning that silver medal was the highlight of his career,

404
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:18,824
even though Steve Waugh had been a part of the World Cup winning team in 1987.

405
00:22:18,824 --> 00:22:21,668
After this, in 2008, during the Beijing Olympics,

406
00:22:21,668 --> 00:22:25,289
he had said that if cricket is to be globalised,

407
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:29,389
it would mean including countries like China and the USA.

408
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:33,866
And to include them, the Olympics is the fast-track way.

409
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:38,564
Australian legendary cricketer Adam Gilchrist echoed these sentiments in 2009,

410
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:40,830
asserting that making cricket an Olympic sport

411
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,469
would encourage many countries to take the sport seriously

412
00:22:43,469 --> 00:22:45,523
and play it for the first time in their history.

413
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:48,941
However, no one considered these appeals seriously for so long.

414
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:51,280
And cricket was kept away from the Olympics.

415
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,084
But now, thankfully, it is changing.

416
00:22:54,084 --> 00:22:57,667
In the upcoming Los Angeles Olympics in 2028,

417
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:01,132
T20 cricket will finally make its Olympic debut.

418
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:05,795
This significant decision is influenced by 
the growing popularity of cricket in America.

419
00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:10,027
With the T20 World Cup scheduled to 
be hosted by the United States next year.

420
00:23:10,027 --> 00:23:13,220
By the time cricket makes its Olympic debut, 

421
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,000
Virat Kohli will likely be 40 years old.

422
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,877
The prospect of witnessing whether 
the greatest Indian cricket right now,

423
00:23:20,877 --> 00:23:24,834
can secure an Olympic gold for us or not.
