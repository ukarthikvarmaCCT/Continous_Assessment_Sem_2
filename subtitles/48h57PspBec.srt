1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
- This is a $1 billion super yacht,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,090
and it's big enough to hold
an entire city on the water.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,620
How do humans build this stuff?

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,930
And I'm gonna show you the
difference between this

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,880
and a $300 million mega yacht,
a $50 million giga yacht,

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,030
all the way down to this $1 yacht.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,860
Why did you sell me
this boat for a dollar?

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,300
- The storage just kept racking up.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,133
- Yeah.
- $18,000.

10
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:24,180
- It's cost you 18 grand
a year to store this?

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,200
- Correct.
- Interesting.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,130
Here you go.
- Thank you.

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,900
And after stepping on board

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,200
it was pretty clear why
this yacht only cost $1.

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,910
Okay, now that we're on the water

16
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,410
what are we working with in here?

17
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,760
- I don't think the floor's
supposed to do that.

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,590
I don't know if this
is even worth a dollar.

19
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,177
- Oh, we're actually sinking. Oh.

20
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:41,070
The boat literally started sinking

21
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,390
right when we put it in the water.

22
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,740
- Oh, my God. Let's go.

23
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,514
- We gotta go up. We're sinking.

24
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,142
Jump, Chandler.

25
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:52,879
My baby!

26
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,570
I paid a dollar for that.

27
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,310
That was the $1 yacht.

28
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,820
Later in this video, we
have a $50 million yacht

29
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,000
a $300 million yacht, and
the $1 billion super yacht.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,460
But before all that,
here's the $1 million yacht

31
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,260
which is a little smaller
than I thought it would be.

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,093
Hop on, boys.

33
00:01:08,093 --> 00:01:10,020
All right.
- Let's see the inside.

34
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,520
- On the $1 million yacht,

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,680
you get a surprisingly big living room,

36
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,630
a lower deck with a master bedroom,

37
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,390
another bedroom that I can't stand up in,

38
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,340
and then you got some
double beds for the kids.

39
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,173
- Wait, you have kids?

40
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:23,040
- Chris, Chandler, Karl, Nolan.

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,268
- Don't worry, boys. I got this.

42
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:25,101
Coming on the break to break.

43
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:27,330
- Please stop. Someone's
gonna send a rescue boat.

44
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,163
- We need the coast guard.

45
00:01:28,163 --> 00:01:30,251
- I wonder if I turn this, if he'll fall.

46
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:31,275
Stop.

47
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:32,741
- This is fun.

48
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,991
Oh.

49
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:38,160
- For a million dollar
boat, I'm not gonna lie,

50
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,660
it's a little smaller than I thought.

51
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,876
Let's see if these guys watch our videos.

52
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:42,273
- Oh, my God, it's Mr. Beast.

53
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:43,830
- Hey, he has seen our channel.

54
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,880
That's pretty funny.

55
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,246
So, now we're going to
the $10 million one.

56
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:48,360
- 10 million?

57
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,440
- See ya.
- It's gonna be great.

58
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,273
- Bye.

59
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:52,840
Oh, my God. He's fast.

60
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,080
- And now we are on the $10 million yacht.

61
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,070
Let's check this out.

62
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,680
- Holy crap, the front of the boat's huge.

63
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,887
It's just way bigger than the last one.

64
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,130
Look at the view.

65
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,660
- I'm getting some good sun here.

66
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,680
I'm really pale.

67
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,380
- Oh, my gosh. Yes,
this is a nice bedroom.

68
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,350
For $9 million more I
can actually stand up.

69
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,800
And right down these stairs
are four more massive bedrooms.

70
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,420
Why are there two toilets side by side?

71
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,380
- Oh, that's a bidet, Jim.

72
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,213
- For your butt?

73
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:18,088
- You poop in here

74
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:19,530
and then you wash your butt in here.

75
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,087
- Why don't you just use toilet paper?

76
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:22,920
- You're so American.

77
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,110
- And upstairs is another seating area.

78
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,943
Oh, my gosh.

79
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:29,040
The seats on the $1 million
yacht were leather and hot.

80
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,360
These are actually soft.

81
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,440
- Soft and practical.

82
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,440
- This boat is the nicest
boat I've been on so far.

83
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,630
- Well, just wait until
you see the next one.

84
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,463
It's massive.

85
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:40,770
And because it's so massive,
I invited all my friends.

86
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,750
Go have fun.
- Go, go, go.

87
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,120
- This boat is meant to hold 150 people.

88
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,000
They're gonna have a lot of fun.

89
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,340
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

90
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,300
- This is wild.

91
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,310
What is the difference
between this and a mansion?

92
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,300
- This is a mansion.

93
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,290
When does it stop?

94
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,580
Jimmy, I'm still going.

95
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,430
- This is definitely the nicest
bedroom we've seen so far.

96
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,530
And it's nice because my
head doesn't hit the ceiling.

97
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,610
I can barely touch it now.

98
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,100
This yacht has a living room, an office,

99
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,491
a massage parlor, two dining
rooms, and seven bedrooms.

100
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,690
- This is the best yacht
I've been on so far.

101
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,887
I'm driving the boat.

102
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:12,259
- Chocolate.

103
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,230
It's not Feastables.

104
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,254
- It's not Feastables.

105
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:15,480
Thank you for saving

106
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,895
my life.
- You're welcome.

107
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,285
No way.

108
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:19,678
♪ You gotta ♪

109
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:20,761
- No.

110
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:24,274
- Hey buddy, are you relaxed?

111
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:25,262
- Yeah, I was.

112
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:26,163
- Are you done with your massage yet?

113
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:27,616
Here you go, take a bite.

114
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,766
- That's some good chocolate.

115
00:03:29,697 --> 00:03:32,125
- So, we got all of the
goon squads in here.

116
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,320
This is a $25 million boat with 30 rooms.

117
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,153
Why are you guys in here?

118
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:36,780
- This bed is so comfortable.

119
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,600
- Even though this yacht
comes with a world class chef

120
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,760
the boys still wanted pizza.

121
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,860
So, I planned a little surprise.

122
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,563
Do you know what we're standing on boys?

123
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:46,770
- A boat.
- A hospital.

124
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,640
- An H.
- A boat.

125
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,350
- A helipad.

126
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,507
And Uber conveniently does
helicopter deliveries.

127
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:54,030
That can't be real.

128
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,145
- Oh, it's real.

129
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:56,506
- Is that a helicopter?

130
00:03:56,506 --> 00:03:57,339
- Pizza.

131
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:59,874
- I can't believe it's actually works.

132
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:01,257
- Pizza!

133
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:03,260
- Pizza, pizza, pizza.

134
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,763
- All this for some pizza.
- Woohoo.

135
00:04:04,763 --> 00:04:07,140
- Pizza, pizza, pizza.

136
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,898
- I am terrified of parallel parking.

137
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:11,267
He just landed a helicopter
on a moving boat.

138
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:12,632
Who wants some pizza?

139
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,720
I know you're not supposed to swim

140
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,890
after you eat a bunch of pizza,

141
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,810
but you're on
- Jump.

142
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,384
a $25 million yacht.

143
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,973
Which thankfully when you pay 25 million,

144
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:24,780
you can get some jet skis.

145
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,700
- Oh.

146
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,020
- Tariq flipped the jet ski.

147
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,376
Yo, Mac. Catch this pizza.

148
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:31,209
Oh.

149
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:32,384
- Oh.

150
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:35,720
- Oh. Oh.

151
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,502
- $25 million yacht and I'm
the only one enjoying it.

152
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,300
- If you thought this yacht was crazy,

153
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,790
look at this video of
the $50 million yacht.

154
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,623
You know what?

155
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:47,040
Honestly, let's just go to it right now.

156
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,910
Zoom in.

157
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,880
And now, we are on the $50 million yacht.

158
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,480
This yacht is over 200 feet
long, four stories high,

159
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,620
can hold over 200 people, and
comes with a 20 person crew

160
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,255
with this homeless person I found.

161
00:05:00,255 --> 00:05:01,088
Sup guys?

162
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:02,575
- When you pay $50 million,

163
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:04,950
you're given this remote
that can call the crew

164
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,003
at any time you call me.

165
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:06,870
- Sir, did you call me?

166
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,753
- No, I just wanted to
show how this works.

167
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,700
But that's not the only
thing the remote does.

168
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,680
They said this TV goes up and down.

169
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,513
- That's cool.

170
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:18,723
That is slow, dude.

171
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,590
Maybe it's like...

172
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:25,410
I'm gonna go downstairs,

173
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,250
you guys go upstairs.

174
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,083
Tell me if you find anything cool.

175
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:27,990
- Okay.
- Okay.

176
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,210
- Bro, it is massive.

177
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,620
- It's like a whole nother boat up here.

178
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,810
- Jimmy, there's nothing
cool up here. Don't worry.

179
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,863
- This is crazy.

180
00:05:34,863 --> 00:05:35,696
- Whoa.

181
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:37,200
The interesting thing is
I've just been walking

182
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,730
and I don't know if I'm
at the halfway point,

183
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,253
the end of the boat, or if I just started.

184
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:41,790
This thing's huge.

185
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,830
- Meanwhile, Nolan overslept.

186
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,870
So, he was still trying to find us.

187
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,147
Have you seen Mr. Beast?

188
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,180
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

189
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,371
- Are you lying to me?

190
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:50,220
- Yeah.

191
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,589
- Apparently Pete Davidson is there.

192
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:53,760
If I don't see Pete Davidson,

193
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,740
I'm gonna sink the $50 million yacht.

194
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,560
- Meanwhile, we noticed
another boat was approaching us

195
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,722
and then the owner did this.

196
00:06:00,722 --> 00:06:02,310
I was waving at him and
he showed me his butt.

197
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,260
- That's gonna be someone's
dad one day, dude.

198
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,508
- All right, catch.

199
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:08,340
Oh.

200
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,480
- Where are they going?
- Gimme that, gimme that.

201
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,680
- Are they backing away from us

202
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,894
or are we just that much better?

203
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,875
Oh.

204
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,507
- Get 'em.

205
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:20,507
- This is the best.
- Oh.

206
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:21,382
Oh.
- Oh.

207
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,766
The guy that's bigger and
stronger than all of us did it.

208
00:06:23,766 --> 00:06:25,890
Wow, Chucky.

209
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,540
- I wonder what kind of
food they got on this yacht.

210
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,373
- I heard they have lamb.

211
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:29,400
- They do not have lamb.

212
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,840
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

213
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,740
- Cut to the dinner.

214
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,240
- Oh, man.
- Whole lamb.

215
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,376
Thank you so much.

216
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,630
- It's really good.

217
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,720
What projects

218
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,490
do you have coming up?
- Uh. Ooh, I'm very excited.

219
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,557
I have a show called Bupkis

220
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:44,910
coming out on Peacock on May 4th.

221
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,144
- Three days before my birthday.

222
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,650
And while Nolan was
still trying to find us.

223
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,772
- Which direction did Mr. Beast go?

224
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,090
- We noticed a lot of boats

225
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,560
surrounding our floating billboards.

226
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,720
I didn't even know you could
put billboards in the ocean.

227
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,760
And we thought they might
want some chocolate.

228
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,512
- I'm delivering chocolate.

229
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:03,012
Yo, you guys want chocolate?

230
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,135
- Let's do this.

231
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:05,504
Oh, my gosh.

232
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:06,868
- Best chocolate I've ever had.

233
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:07,890
- Let's go.
- It's so good.

234
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,600
- Yeah.
- Let know if this is

235
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,680
the best chocolate bar ever.

236
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,255
- Oh, my God. Out of 10, it's an 11.

237
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:14,088
Hershey's don't know nothing.

238
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:15,840
- Hershey's doesn't know nothing.

239
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,460
Everyone agrees it's
better than Hershey's.

240
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,630
You need to try it.

241
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,560
Tell me what you think.

242
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,510
- Honestly, way better than Reese's.

243
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,770
- That's what I like to hear.

244
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,634
What do you give it?

245
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:25,008
Aye.

246
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:27,090
- A 10.
- I'm flying Feastable bars

247
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,923
to people.

248
00:07:27,923 --> 00:07:28,756
Aye, Feastables incoming.

249
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:31,650
- Oh, no.
- Let go of the string.

250
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,141
One Feastable bar delivered.

251
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:34,140
Hey Karl,

252
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,129
they're trying your gummies.

253
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,250
- If you wanna try the best
chocolate bars, cookies,

254
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,750
and gummies on the planet?

255
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,900
Go to Walmart, 7-Eleven, or
any Albertsons stores right now

256
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,337
or go to feastables.com right
now if you wanna order online.

257
00:07:46,337 --> 00:07:47,262
Hey, what do you think?

258
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:48,095
- This is amazing.

259
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:49,500
This is better than every other chocolate

260
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,150
so why wouldn't you get Deez Nutz?

261
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,520
- I agree. Put our nuts in your mouth.

262
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,748
- Oh. Alright.

263
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,740
- At the end of the day,
Nolan finally found us.

264
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,870
- Jimmy.

265
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,960
- Nolan.

266
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,471
We had another five star dinner.

267
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:04,860
And the next morning we boarded

268
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,810
one of the world's largest yachts.

269
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,110
This is the $300 million yacht

270
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,060
and it has over 50 crew members

271
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,770
waiting on your every request.

272
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,390
Tons of luxurious rooms

273
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,040
and nine master bedrooms.

274
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,374
Oh, my gosh. Great.

275
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:19,207
- Welcome aboard.

276
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,989
- I literally can't see the
top of the boat from here.

277
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:21,930
We are the 69th

278
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,830
largest yacht in the world.

279
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,663
- Is that a factual statement?

280
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:25,440
- Yes, it is.
- That is crazy.

281
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,320
There are six floors, a massive pool,

282
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,880
and a hot tub with a view.

283
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,930
This is nice.

284
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,130
- It's ridiculous.

285
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,123
- It's my favorite boat so far.

286
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:36,990
- The $300 million yacht comes
with a state-of-the-art gym

287
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,401
that overlooks the ocean.

288
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:39,510
- Oh, what?

289
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,333
- Dude, if my boat had
a gym, I'm working out.

290
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,880
- A movie theater with
windows that auto darkened

291
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,140
whenever you watch something.

292
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,960
And even the table is worth $3 million

293
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,690
and the piano plays itself.

294
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,070
I want one of these in my house.

295
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,892
All the boys disappeared in the spa.

296
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:56,010
Come with me.

297
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,120
Oh, you're getting a haircut?

298
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,010
Yeah. Karl was in the sauna.

299
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,970
Are you alive?

300
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,840
- Barely.

301
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,070
- That does not look comfortable.

302
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,050
And I don't even know where Nolan is.

303
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,573
- Oh, it's so hot.

304
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:07,650
- Man, really got in a hot tub

305
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,010
with a sunburn.
- It's too hot.

306
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,220
- Dude, there's more downstairs?

307
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,630
- Whoa.
- Oh, my gosh.

308
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,310
- You think they have enough jet skis?

309
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,900
- What's behind this door?

310
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,490
- Oh, I'm doing this.

311
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,860
- One of us is getting thrown
off the side of the boat.

312
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,227
- Huh?

313
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:25,113
- He was last.
- Bye.

314
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,130
- Hey, always, always
be ready for nose goes.

315
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,930
- Jimmy, can we eat some food?

316
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,950
- Yeah, when you get back.

317
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,503
Boys, we must act like rich billionaires.

318
00:09:34,503 --> 00:09:35,490
Clink.

319
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,150
Would you rather have 300 $1 million ships

320
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,040
or one $300 million ship?

321
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,000
- You could almost have one

322
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,170
for every different day of the year.

323
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,760
- I'm not gonna take care of 300 boats.

324
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,810
- Which would you rather have?

325
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,550
300 boats or one big boat?

326
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,510
- You want the big boat?

327
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,060
- Gentlemen, did any of you
notice a boat pulling up?

328
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,893
- No.

329
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:53,730
- On that boat might be Tom Brady.

330
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,930
By might, I mean it is.

331
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,190
And we should probably go say hi to him.

332
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,840
- Let's go.

333
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,980
- Hey, Tom.
- What's up, guys?

334
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,870
- And if you don't know who Tom Brady is,

335
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,900
he is the number one
quarterback in NFL history.

336
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,090
So, this is where you get
your haircut on the boat.

337
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,270
So, it turns into a dentistry.
- Where you wash.

338
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,402
- Clean your teeth too.

339
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:09,810
Is this the nicest boat

340
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,133
you've been on?
- My God, are you kidding me?

341
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:12,090
- Yeah.
- It's crazy

342
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,150
if you eat too many Deez
Nutz bars before breakfast.

343
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,920
I literally had to hide them in my house

344
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,390
because I knew these two would sneak

345
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,223
to right where they're at.
- Yeah.

346
00:10:19,223 --> 00:10:20,820
- I did. This place is so fun.

347
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,140
It's really an endless maze.

348
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,430
I think it's a nicest boat in the world.

349
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,510
That's what we do.
- It's so beautiful.

350
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,040
- It's crazy.
- We still have more floors

351
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,510
to go on.
- Tariq's, the master

352
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,396
of the camera.

353
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:29,430
Thank you, thank you.

354
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,410
- This is a way nicer helicopter pad.

355
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,720
- When I think of a
helicopter pad on a yacht

356
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,710
this is what I think of.

357
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,970
Not what we had before.

358
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,890
And with Tom Brady here, of course,

359
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,060
we had to play some football.

360
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,770
This is the most fun version of catch

361
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,470
'cause you just do this and
he just throws it there.

362
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,303
- Nope.

363
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:45,136
- I just suck.

364
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:47,100
- That's what I got paid
for, Jimmy. Come on.

365
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,500
- I wanna see if you could
hit my drone out of the sky

366
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,333
- Oh, no.
- with a football.

367
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,500
- All right, if I hit the
drone on the first try,

368
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,820
maybe I should come out of retirement.

369
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,920
- I like that.
- Dad, you're gonna like miss.

370
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,030
- I probably will miss.

371
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,507
- First try.

372
00:10:59,507 --> 00:11:01,015
- Go, go, go.
- Oh.

373
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:03,030
He got it.

374
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,757
- Nolan, put your sunscreen on.

375
00:11:04,757 --> 00:11:06,450
Karl's probably the worst

376
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,220
wide receiver you've ever thrown to.

377
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,510
Unless you dome him in the head,

378
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,343
he's probably not gonna catch it.

379
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:12,450
All right, Karl, don't screw this up.

380
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,490
Just throw it as far as you can.

381
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:18,450
You hit him in the chest.

382
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,190
You gotta hit him in the head.
- It's a bad placing.

383
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,810
After chilling with Tom Brady,

384
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,240
we hung out in the movie room
for the rest of the night.

385
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,730
Would you say this is
the best boat so far?

386
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,680
- 100%.
- But keep in mind,

387
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,890
there's still a billion
dollar boat after this.

388
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,000
- How big can that get?

389
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,190
- It is four times bigger than this boat.

390
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,330
- These things get bigger?

391
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,270
- This ship is bigger than
three statues of liberty.

392
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,140
- Holy crap.

393
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,890
- You cannot fathom how
massive this ship is.

394
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,030
It is literally a floating city

395
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,780
that is 1200 feet wide
and 17 stories high,

396
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,020
and it fits almost 10,000 people.

397
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,390
In all the other ships
we had our own rooms

398
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,300
but this ship has over 2000 rooms.

399
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,180
This boat has water
slides, an indoor mall,

400
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,580
a basketball court,
and tons of other stuff

401
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,570
I can't even name.

402
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,650
- I ran out of fingers.

403
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,600
- All of which we have to ourselves.

404
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,073
Have fun boys.
- Yeah, yeah.

405
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,863
- Brother, it's that way.

406
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,640
- Oh, okay.
- Let's see what happens.

407
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,170
- Whoa, there's a water slide.

408
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,150
- There's a whole entire
waterpark up here.

409
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,983
I'm breaking the rules.

410
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:17,040
- We're running, we're running.

411
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,880
- Sorry, lifeguard.

412
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,950
They literally have live
music in the waterpark.

413
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,870
What the heck?
- There's even an entire

414
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,450
sports floor that has
everything you can imagine.

415
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,530
- Mini golf.
- Let's go.

416
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,506
- We're literally playing
mini golf on a ship right now.

417
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,150
Interference.

418
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,590
- And I wasn't exaggerating,

419
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,570
when I said this ship is a city.

420
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,510
There's literally seven
neighborhoods on this ship.

421
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,560
This is insane.

422
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,760
We're still on a ship.

423
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,920
And just for reference, this is what one

424
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,210
of those neighborhoods look like.

425
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,530
- So, I went down to the slide

426
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,050
and now I'm teleported into
like a different world.

427
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,520
And you have a carousel?

428
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,090
- They have shops, restaurants,
arcades, even a Starbucks.

429
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,050
Hey, Chandler.

430
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,250
- Hey.
- A hundred million people

431
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,083
are watching.

432
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,401
Let's see if you make the shot.

433
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,520
- This is crazy.

434
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,620
Like how can I use all these seats?

435
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,030
I'm only one person.

436
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,980
- And apparently there's an entire floor

437
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,644
for indoor shows and events.

438
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:07,680
- What is this, bro?

439
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,660
We got the whole ship to ourselves,

440
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,690
selves, selves, selves,
selves, selves, selves.

441
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,720
- Obviously, I don't need
this giant ship all to myself,

442
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,513
so I wanted to share this
experience with you guys,

443
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:19,378
my subscribers.

444
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,500
- I love Mr. Beast.

445
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,640
- Subscribe to Mr. Beast.

446
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,660
- Holy cow, this boat.

447
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,760
- It's actually pretty nice.

448
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,360
- Let's go, boys. Let's get it.

449
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,763
- We're gonna go ride the carousel.

450
00:13:28,763 --> 00:13:31,727
- Carousel, carousel,

451
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,480
carousel.

452
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,639
- Where'd Chandler go?

453
00:13:37,676 --> 00:13:38,550
Oh.

454
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,160
- And just when we had thought
we had seen everything here.

455
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,090
What is this?

456
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,800
How do humans build this stuff?

457
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,370
Also in this giant mall,
inside of this giant ship

458
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,490
there's a bar that comes
down from the ceiling.

459
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,840
Wait, what are those robotic arms?

460
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,501
- That's our bionic bar.

461
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:54,526
- Oh, it's all right, buddy.

462
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:55,497
- Oh.
- Oh.

463
00:13:55,497 --> 00:13:57,253
- Whoo. Woohoo.

464
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,984
This is sick.

465
00:13:58,984 --> 00:14:00,138
- From the kids menu.

466
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:01,260
- Oh, my God.

467
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,120
- See how much you guys, my subscribers,

468
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,200
we're enjoying this ship.

469
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,880
- Never let go.
- Never let go.

470
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,010
- And I had one last
surprise for my subscribers

471
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:08,843
on the cruise ship.

472
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:10,495
So, I had Nolan gathered
them all together.

473
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:11,670
I have a big announcement

474
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,503
for all of you.

475
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,490
To all the subscribers
we brought here today.

476
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,888
We're giving you a
three night free cruise.

477
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,710
- And if you wanna be in
a video in the future,

478
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,378
subscribe so you can join us next time.

479
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:26,490
We filmed a secret Mr. Beast

480
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,710
video that will never
be uploaded to YouTube.

481
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,600
The only way you can watch this video

482
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,600
is by buying a Feastables
product within the next 30 days

483
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,730
and scanning the QR
code on the back of it.

484
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,280
There's literally never been a
better time to buy Feastables

485
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,000
from Walmart, Albertsons,
7-Eleven, or feastables.com.

486
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,760
I spent over a million
dollars on this secret video.

487
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,910
You wanna buy Feastables,
so you can watch.
