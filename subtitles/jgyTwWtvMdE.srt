1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,240
- The people in this video take
being lucky to the extreme,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,360
from finding a $250 million
lottery ticket on the street

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,170
to winning the championship game

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,170
with a full court basketball shot.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,520
- That's extremely lucky.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,380
- NASCAR crew dodges two cars.

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,580
- Dude, I love NASCAR.

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,630
- Into the danger zone.

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,493
- Jason-
- Jason!

10
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:18,331
You're in the danger zone!

11
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:19,890
- Jason, man.

12
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,390
- Jason, gosh darn it.

13
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,441
Get out of the danger zone!
- Jason,

14
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:23,794
you're not Jason Bourne!

15
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,661
- Jason don't know nothing but jacking.

16
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:27,510
Look at him.

17
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,010
He jumped with a floor jack.

18
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,568
Those things weigh like 60 pounds.

19
00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:31,570
That's insane.

20
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,020
- Right, so they're riding a rollercoaster

21
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,790
and he catches someone's phone

22
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,590
that fell off a different rollercoaster.

23
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,120
- Wait, 'cause now he can probably look

24
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,730
through that guy's phone
and embarrass him and stuff

25
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,720
and that's pretty funny.

26
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,070
- Imagine falling from this.
- Imagine dragon.

27
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,840
Yo, they were asking for
that to happen once, dude.

28
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,330
- Oh, boy.

29
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,230
- Those are blanks.

30
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,400
Okay, those are blanks.

31
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,512
Yeah, it was probably just the air.

32
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,513
I don't know.

33
00:00:57,513 --> 00:00:58,513
Well, mm.

34
00:00:58,513 --> 00:00:59,664
I saw like a little,

35
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:01,530
it looked like there might
have been a little projectile.

36
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,580
- So this is, uh.

37
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,630
- No way.

38
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,101
- Your local WWE.

39
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:07,530
- Did you see the guy on the side?

40
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,640
He was like, "Yo, turn around.

41
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,410
You just did the coolest
thing I've ever seen."

42
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,550
- Okay, so he's jumping up.

43
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,383
Oh!

44
00:01:12,383 --> 00:01:13,590
- Wow.
- Oh!

45
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,724
- I don't know if that was luck.

46
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:16,380
That looked like skill.

47
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,340
- What is this?

48
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,567
- This is tree falling.

49
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:19,567
- Nani?

50
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:20,770
- Nice. He made a new tree.
- Oh, there we go.

51
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,890
Okay, okay, I'll approve, I'll approve.

52
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,723
All right gentlemen,

53
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:26,700
this is why you should
always wear safety goggles.

54
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,890
- Number one, I saw this on TikTok.

55
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,360
Number two, it's proven fake.

56
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,800
- I wanna believe it's real.

57
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,180
- No, it's on the internet.

58
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,013
It's fake.
- No!

59
00:01:34,013 --> 00:01:34,980
- Everything on the internet's fake.

60
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,660
- I just wanna believe that he's sawing,

61
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,100
it snaps in half and that catches it.

62
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,360
That's so cool.

63
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,515
- I watched a long video about this.

64
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:43,500
He was in a submarine.
- Uh-huh.

65
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,290
- It sank to the bottom,
it had an air pocket.

66
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,672
It was on the bottom of the ocean.

67
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:51,810
He was living in an air pocket
in pitch black for four days.

68
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,370
He felt sharks swimming
around him and everything.

69
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,203
- Oh my gosh.

70
00:01:55,203 --> 00:01:56,700
- In freezing cold water, dude.

71
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,570
- And they got him out?

72
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,410
- Yeah, they got him out.

73
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,790
- Let's high five for that guy.

74
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,830
This is a state championship game.

75
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,684
The team in black is
currently up by three points.

76
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:04,607
He misses.
- Oh, that's a miss.

77
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:05,490
That's a big miss.

78
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,110
- Okay, look.

79
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,110
Half a second is left on the clock.

80
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,090
- Wait a minute, Jimmy,
where he's standing at,

81
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,160
approximately would be worth three points.

82
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,248
No chance he makes it, Jimmy.

83
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,053
Wow, that's sick.

84
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:18,992
- Ooh.

85
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:19,825
- This is why I'm scared of baseball.

86
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:21,185
I got hit in the face with
a ball like that one time.

87
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:22,113
Look at that.

88
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,450
- Dude, it literally
went across his chest.

89
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,470
- Just catch it.

90
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,828
- What do you mean just catch it?

91
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:30,870
He tried.
- Just catch it.

92
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,430
This is why I don't ice climb.

93
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,160
- This is like that "Modern
Warfare II" mission.

94
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,390
It kind of looks like he hit it.

95
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,940
- He's only climbing
with those two sheaths.

96
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,680
- And his feet have spikes on him.

97
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,790
That's the only other thing.
- Oh my God.

98
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,772
- No rope, no nothing, dude.

99
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:44,040
- If you lose your footing,

100
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,480
it's just that one thing holding you up.

101
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,403
- Mm-hm.
- No, never ice climbing.

102
00:02:46,403 --> 00:02:48,273
- Whoa.

103
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,483
That's in.

104
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:51,843
- Oh, might have been an accident.

105
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:52,830
- Stay in your lane.

106
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,600
Yeah, it's an accident.
- So they collided.

107
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,770
This guy's knocked out.

108
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,600
- Just blacked out.

109
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,530
- Wow.
- Nice.

110
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,760
- He just saved his life.

111
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,221
All right, so these workers
are working on a building.

112
00:03:01,221 --> 00:03:03,090
Whoa.

113
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,250
That's like a Minecraft sand trap.

114
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,083
- Oh my god.

115
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,649
Look at that guy on the pole.

116
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:08,887
- He's just like,

117
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:11,010
"This is the safest spot. I know it."

118
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,150
- He bought a lottery ticket,

119
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,200
a winning lottery ticket,

120
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,730
but he left it at the store.

121
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,687
And thankfully, an honest
cashier came to the rescue.

122
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:18,480
- You work at a gas station,

123
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,890
someone buys a lottery ticket.
- Mm-hmm.

124
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,180
- They leave it there.
- Mm-hmm.

125
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,013
- You grab it.

126
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:22,920
Next day you find out,

127
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,668
it wins a quarter of a billion dollars.

128
00:03:24,668 --> 00:03:26,670
You giving it back or you keeping it?

129
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,750
- To the bank.

130
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,597
I would anonymously leave
him a million dollars.

131
00:03:30,597 --> 00:03:32,547
- Yeah, maybe two.
- To be nice.

132
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:33,380
- Two million.

133
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,590
- But look, that's on you.

134
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,993
Finders, keepers.
- Losers, weepers.

135
00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:42,156
Oh.

136
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:42,989
- Wow.
- Bro, come on.

137
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:43,822
We do Team Trees

138
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:44,655
and this is how he pays
back Mother Nature.

139
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:47,820
- Geez, that tree said,
"Mm, it's your time."

140
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,151
- Right, this guy's on the ladder.

141
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:50,206
- Oh, Christmas lights.

142
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:51,206
This is why I don't hang Christmas lights.

143
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:52,039
- Oh, oh.

144
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,750
- Dude, imagine not being alive anymore

145
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,430
because you were hanging Christmas lights.

146
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,160
- Oh, thank gosh he had help.
- Wow, he had a lot of help.

147
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,690
- It's like they were just
waiting for it to happen.

148
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,190
- Yo, if I ever fall off a roof,

149
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,910
I better have six dudes come help me.

150
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,580
- Okay, so he's driving.

151
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,145
- Getting a lot of sway going.
- He seems to swerve.

152
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:08,539
Yeah, he's noticing.

153
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:12,008
- Oh, Lord have mercy.
- He's noticing.

154
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:12,841
Dang.

155
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:13,860
- Oh, what's gonna happen?

156
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,360
Oh, wait, is it loose?

157
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,830
- No, it's still connected.

158
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,249
It's a trailer but it's getting sideways.

159
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:20,230
Man, he handled that incredibly.

160
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,020
- Never let 'em know your next move.

161
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,030
- I was about to say.

162
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,140
- This clip has the title
card of an inch away.

163
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,310
And before we watch the clip,

164
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,750
I just wanna say I don't understand

165
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,490
why that's in the World's luckiest clips.

166
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,840
- Because-
- That seems pretty far away.

167
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,430
- An inch is a ton of space.

168
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,992
Some would say it's
almost a little too much.

169
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:38,781
- I mean, he still hit that sign.

170
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:40,294
Through that sign.

171
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,917
- Move your car now.

172
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,177
- Skater.

173
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:46,113
- Oh.
- Oh.

174
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:47,693
That was a pretty cool trick in itself.

175
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:50,520
- Kid, you are what Chris wishes he was.

176
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,353
- Hey, no.

177
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:52,186
What I wish I was,

178
00:04:52,186 --> 00:04:54,240
was that Sabrett hot dog.

179
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,680
'Cause that thing look good.

180
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,082
- The best evasive
maneuver I've ever seen.

181
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,370
- Whoa, oh.

182
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,628
Kicking drywall is so much fun.

183
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:09,628
Oh.

184
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,230
A lot went wrong so quick.

185
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,690
- But also right.

186
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,082
Oh.
- Oh.

187
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:18,570
- Oh!

188
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,730
- Don't have to know sports
to know that was sick.

189
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,160
- West Brick capitalized on the Brick.

190
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,510
- He did, that was beautiful.

191
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,343
- That was very cool.

192
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:26,970
Crazy ping pong saves.

193
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,803
Oh, he's only got one arm.

194
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:29,400
Whoa.
- Whoa.

195
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,905
That's cool.

196
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:31,908
Congrats to you.

197
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:32,911
- He didn't even react.

198
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:33,912
That's how you know
he's been there before.

199
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:35,190
Oh, that's a giant hole, right?

200
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,090
Am I looking at a hole?

201
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,928
What am I looking at?

202
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:39,270
- Oh.

203
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,100
- Oh my goodness.
- Wow.

204
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,550
How does the guy who's currently
standing there feel safe?

205
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,140
He's like, "Let me get closer to the edge

206
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,973
just so you can see it."

207
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:48,150
Humans are dumb.

208
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,490
I love people, but humans are really dumb.

209
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,960
- We've all seen this clip, all right?

210
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,830
He's getting interviewed.

211
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,663
Boom.

212
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,641
- Was that fake? Did that happen?

213
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:58,140
Did that turn out fake?

214
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,250
- I don't know, it's kinda hard

215
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,352
to believe it's real 'cause watch, see,

216
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:02,100
it's coming, coming, he gets it.

217
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,390
- Oh but wait, you can't,

218
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,240
this isn't a picture, you
can only Photoshop pictures,

219
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,405
you can't Photoshop video.

220
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:09,720
- So far, I'd say these
people are pretty lucky.

221
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,820
- Yeah, lucky we didn't
call 'em out sooner

222
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,943
on the fakeness.

223
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,630
- He hit the mother load.

224
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,480
- Three or four other
people's unluckiest days

225
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,130
became his luckiest day ever.

226
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,330
- Does he get it?
- Oh.

227
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,687
No way.
- Really?

228
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,163
He's in too deep.

229
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,833
- Oh, shake it, shake it, shake it.

230
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:37,500
Why would you not just kick it? Come on.

231
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,240
- This is intense.
- He can do it.

232
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,383
- Come on, come on.

233
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:43,726
- Nice, he got the whole lot.

234
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:45,960
- Bro, look at that genuine excitement.

235
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,150
- He's like, "I only had to
pay for half these chips,

236
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,260
oh my God!"

237
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,760
