1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,002
This is my old Feastables chocolate bar.

2
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,552
And as you know, it tastes
better than a Hershey's bar.

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,425
Now, I know what you're thinking.

4
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,385
Jimmy, why are you in engulfing

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,637
your old Feastables bar in flames?

6
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,806
Well,
it all started about one year ago.

7
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,683
I was in a Feastables
business meeting,

8
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,186
and I realized tasting better
than Hershey's wasn't so special.

9
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,309
Doesn't everything
taste better than Hershey's?

10
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,486
Like, literally, doesn't anything

11
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,470
on the planet taste
better than a Hershey's bar?

12
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,928
- Yeah.
- I think so.

13
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,919
None of you felt the need to tell me this?

14
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,357
If everything tastes better than
Hershey's, what makes us special?

15
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,965
Yeah, well, the answer is nothing.

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,143
And to be honest,

17
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:54,346
myself and my entire company
weren't exactly fans of that harsh truth.

18
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,806
So I set out to do something better.

19
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,933
And what's better than being better
than Hershey's?

20
00:00:59,351 --> 00:00:59,908
Am I fired?

21
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:01,604
Well, how about being better
than everyone?

22
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,063
The best on Earth.

23
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,231
And from that day forward,
we worked tireless.

24
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,776
Like I'm talking barely even sleeping.

25
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,945
I travelled from country to country,

26
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,114
chocolate factory
to chocolate factory.

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,272
Tried out thousands of formulas.

28
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:16,493
Which eventually led us to this.

29
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:21,790
The best tasting
chocolate ever made by mankind,

30
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,710
also known
as our brand new Feastables bar.

31
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,296
This is the best tasting
chocolate on Earth.

32
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,337
Good job, boys.

33
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,757
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,093
How do we know that's
the best tasting chocolate in the world?

35
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,440
Why did he say that?

36
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:35,596
You're fired.

37
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,263
Leave.

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,849
I was just going to say
that we do a blind taste test.

39
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:40,959
Wait a minute.

40
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,688
We should prove it
in a blind taste test format.

41
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:45,494
That's genius.

42
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,204
You're rehired.

43
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,366
So I set up a random warehouse,

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,654
where I'm going to invite
hundreds of strangers

45
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,032
to do a blind taste test
of our brand new chocolate.

46
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,659
All four of these pieces of chocolate
have no branding,

47
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,286
and there's no labels distinguishing
anything between them.

48
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,622
The only thing
they are voting on is taste.

49
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,334
So now it's time to see
how our new chocolate formula

50
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:08,193
holds up to three
of the top European chocolates.

51
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,101
I like the first one the best.

52
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,426
Of course she picked Feastables.

53
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,771
- I'm going to go with the first one.
- Yep.

54
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,644
It has a really nice bite to it

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,682
and it's a little bit
richer than the other ones.

56
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,230
I'm not even surprised
by what she's saying.

57
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:24,311
- Another one.
- I like that a lot, it's really good.

58
00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:25,368
I would eat that every day.

59
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,192
That is what
an intelligent man looks like.

60
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,994
It's a weird taste
I haven't tasted before.

61
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:29,976
It reminds me of like...

62
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:32,235
It's not Hershey's.
Hershey's is not that good.

63
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,817
Better than Hershey's. Spot on.

64
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,161
This might bankrupt Hershey's.

65
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:36,123
That chocolate. I'm pretty sure.

66
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,243
Another one.

67
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,415
Back to back, back to back.

68
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:41,001
To be honest, we just keep winning.

69
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:41,668
It's boring.

70
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,222
And the new bars come in seven flavours.

71
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,460
- Milk Chocolate.
- Thank you.

72
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:49,734
- Milk Crunch.
- Yes, please.

73
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,441
Almond.

74
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,247
Peanut Butter.

75
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,558
It used to be called Deez Nuts,
but you know...

76
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,315
- Peanut Butter Crunch.
- That one.

77
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,255
- Dark Chocolate.
- Mine.

78
00:02:57,288 --> 00:02:58,428
And Dark Chocolate Sea Salt.

79
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,220
Thank you.

80
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,973
The new bars are available
nationwide in every single Walmart.

81
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,891
Go give them a try.

82
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,143
We've genuinely
put a ton of effort into these.

83
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,728
And if you spend your money on Feastables,

84
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,188
I really want you to enjoy it.

85
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,035
And starting February 17th,
for 30 days straight,

86
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:13,723
we're going to be giving away $10,000

87
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:18,281
to a lucky customer who scans the QR code
on the back of any new Feastables bar.

88
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,699
So go give the new bars a try.

89
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,742
You might win ten grand.

90
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,540
And I can't wait
to see what all of you think.

91
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:27,437
GO TRY A NEW FEASTABLES BAR!
YOU COULD WIN $10,000!
