1
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:17,727
Granddad, did you start yet?
- No.

2
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:20,047
Move aside..

3
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,167
Brother Asha..

4
00:00:21,247 --> 00:00:22,647
Get in line.
It's my turn after him.

5
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:24,527
Isn't Granddad done yet?

6
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:27,527
Try another song.

7
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:31,214
It's weird to help Granddad
by singing everyday.

8
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:42,531
Get in the line, Apu.

9
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:45,571
Granddad?
- Yes. - Come on!

10
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:47,211
Is he still having trouble?

11
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:48,771
What happened?

12
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:51,531
Tell him to get in line
for the sweets.

13
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:53,571
Dad again?

14
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:55,891
Exactly, Dad.

15
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:59,771
We spend our mornings
in helping him empty his bowel.

16
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:02,891
It's all because of him.

17
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:03,851
Because of me?

18
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:06,571
Am I stopping him from doing it?

19
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:08,331
Why can't you get a commode

20
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:10,411
for the unfinished
bathroom upstairs?

21
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:13,171
He is right, Dad.

22
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:14,971
All right,
do me a favour.

23
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,611
Stop being celibate
and get married.

24
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,211
Ask you father-in-law
for a bride, a pair of clothes

25
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:22,411
and a commode.

26
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:24,371
Don't be a miser.

27
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:26,771
Tell him that if he
wants to save money

28
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:28,011
stop feeding him so that

29
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:29,171
he doesn't come here
in the morning.

30
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:32,051
And if he is feeding him,
he should find a solution too.

31
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:33,611
Move aside.
I am going in.

32
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:36,171
Hey..
- Hey, we are waiting here.

33
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:39,131
Why did you stop singing?

34
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:41,411
It's not helping, is it?

35
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:45,691
Say that dialogue, Rana,
I will drink your blood.

36
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:48,811
That dialogue stopped working
before the 'Dussera'.

37
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:50,651
His system keeps
updating as well.

38
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:54,251
I think that we should
call a sorcerer.

39
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,051
He too must be squatting down
somewhere right now.

40
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:58,131
Let's strike the plates.

41
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,451
It helped during
the first lock-down.

42
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:04,051
The entire India did it.

43
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:07,731
Only then he did it
at five o'clock.

44
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:09,531
How will just four plates help?

45
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:14,811
How did we handle it in Shimla?
It was easy over there.

46
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:16,691
The hotel was near a cliff.

47
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:19,371
He got scared
and it became easy.

48
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,211
Let's sing a 'Qawwali'.

49
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:24,171
They were singing
it on the train

50
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,451
and he got it done
in the first verse.

51
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:27,851
That's because they were
professional singers.

52
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,691
Should we take him
for Bungee jumping now?

53
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:32,131
Get him out of there

54
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:33,971
or else I will
have to do it here.

55
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:35,891
What happened?

56
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:39,051
Can't the whole family
together get it done?

57
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:44,051
Punjabi!
Play a Punjabi song!

58
00:02:44,091 --> 00:02:45,611
The high energy
will make it easy for him.

59
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:01,403
Are you done?
- I did it in the fourth verse.

60
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,203
Yes!
- Yes!

61
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:11,643
My dear child..

62
00:03:11,883 --> 00:03:13,603
Feeding a hungry man

63
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:16,323
and emptying the bowel
of a constipated man

64
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:18,203
both are noble deeds.

65
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:19,923
Stay blessed.

66
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:20,963
Now go ahead.

67
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:25,003
Hey! - Dad..
- Dad..

68
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,643
Open it..
- Open it!

69
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:29,523
I have readied your bag
according to the schedule.

70
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:30,603
The lunch is in it too.

71
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:34,843
Don't put this water bottle
in the bag if it leaks.

72
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,483
Otherwise, it will ruin
the history and geography.

73
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:41,963
Where is your school uniform?

74
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:43,003
Will you go to school
wearing this?

75
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:45,363
I go to school
without doing my homework.

76
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,483
Today, I will go without
wearing the school uniform.

77
00:03:47,563 --> 00:03:49,883
I see. You will go to school
without wearing the uniform

78
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,563
on your mushroom
cut anniversary? - What?

79
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,363
Have you forgotten?

80
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:55,563
You had mushroom cut
for the first time on this date

81
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:56,603
two years back.

82
00:03:57,483 --> 00:03:58,843
You remember the date!

83
00:03:59,283 --> 00:04:02,163
Yes, such small things
bring happiness in life.

84
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:05,465
Forget it.
Where is your school uniform?

85
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:07,185
I have not found
my school uniform.

86
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,465
You have not found!

87
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,625
Yesterday, I asked Aloukik
to wash your shirt.

88
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:11,505
Come with me.

89
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:13,985
Stop. Where are you going?
Stop.

90
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:15,865
I won't spare you today.
Stop.

91
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:20,025
Don't do this, Mr. Hatasha.

92
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:22,345
Mr. Asha Amar.

93
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:25,065
How many times I have told you..

94
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:27,305
Don't keep your underwear
for drying on my towel.

95
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:29,185
And what's this?

96
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:30,745
You wear only red
colour underwear!

97
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,385
It has left colour stains.

98
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:35,945
It's perfect.

99
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:38,905
If you wear this towel,
you will look like Superman.

100
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:41,385
He is making fun of
his elder brother.

101
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:45,105
What are you doing here?

102
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,745
Has dad hired you to work
in the shop

103
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:49,825
or he has hired you
to come here and laugh?

104
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:54,345
He asks me to do every work
if there is any.

105
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:55,305
Okay, leave!

106
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,585
Aloukik, where
is Akki's uniform?

107
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,745
But it's still dirty.
- Impossible!

108
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:10,825
Aloukik and I washed
this together.

109
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:14,705
Wash our clothes which have
become dirty in the process.

110
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:18,745
But the backside of the
collar is still dirty.

111
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:20,185
Who looks the backside?

112
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:23,505
Kids go to school
to progress in life.

113
00:05:24,745 --> 00:05:25,745
This means, you didn't
wash the entire shirt.

114
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:26,865
Brother Asha..

115
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:31,345
Brother Asha Amar suggested me
not to wash the entire shirt.

116
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:32,985
He asked me to remove
armpit stains.

117
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:34,345
Those parts become dirty
due to sweat.

118
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:38,225
Even I liked the idea.

119
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,745
Hence, I just removed
armpit stains.

120
00:05:41,145 --> 00:05:44,545
Akki can't go to school
wearing this shirt.

121
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:46,345
Sister-in-law,
ask him to wear this.

122
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:48,545
See, I have done a great job.

123
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:49,945
Thank God!

124
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:51,505
This shirt is clean.

125
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,545
Wear this. - Okay.
- Just a moment..

126
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:57,185
What's this?
- Chalk.

127
00:05:57,545 --> 00:05:58,745
Chalk?
- You are surprised, right?

128
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,625
Even this was
Brother Asha's idea.

129
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:04,545
I just followed his suggestion.

130
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:07,145
I have been applying chalk
on stains since my childhood.

131
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:08,785
Brother-in-law,
it was a simple work.

132
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:09,905
You couldn't even do that.

133
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:12,345
Last week, I asked
to put papads for drying.

134
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:14,105
You used hair dryer.

135
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:17,065
After that, I asked to remove
spider's web from the storeroom.

136
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:18,785
You kept the stool
on the cupboard.

137
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:19,865
So that spider's web
can't be visible.

138
00:06:20,265 --> 00:06:21,745
That's the main problem
if something is visible, right?

139
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:23,865
Spider's web doesn't fly
and gets stuck on things.

140
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:27,265
It's okay.

141
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:29,265
Akki, come.
- Aunt.

142
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:32,145
You give me toffees
and make me wear casual.

143
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:34,105
I will say that
today is my birthday.

144
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:36,545
Come..

145
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:41,705
Sargam, such a small problem!

146
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:43,025
Is it a small problem?

147
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,265
He is the first student
of the school

148
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:47,145
who celebrates his birthday
four times in a year.

149
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:48,585
He has gone to school
wearing casual even today.

150
00:06:48,945 --> 00:06:50,105
Moreover, if father-in-law
gets to know

151
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:51,545
that he has distributed
toffees for no reason

152
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:52,745
I will get scolded.

153
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:54,545
Baby, relax..
It's fine.

154
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:55,945
Everything is fine.

155
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:59,625
You always ask me to relax
and say 'everything is fine'.

156
00:06:59,705 --> 00:07:01,265
Stop this.
Because nothing can be fine

157
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:02,305
just like that.

158
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:04,145
Actually, 'Poha'..

159
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:06,265
Hey, today is Tuesday, right?

160
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:07,665
You must have prepared
Parathas too.

161
00:07:07,785 --> 00:07:08,625
I couldn't prepare
Parathas today.

162
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:09,745
Why?

163
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:11,665
It's fine.

164
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:13,305
'Poha' is fine.

165
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:16,945
'Poha'?

166
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:18,785
But today is Tuesday.

167
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:20,265
You must have prepared
Parathas too.

168
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:23,905
Appu.
- Aloukik, my brother..

169
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:26,065
She has prepared
only 'Poha', okay?

170
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:28,425
Only 'Poha'!

171
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:31,505
It's fine, Aloukik.

172
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:38,585
See.

173
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:39,625
Everything is fine.

174
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:44,705
Are you preparing breakfast
or inventing corona vaccine?

175
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:46,905
How long will you take?

176
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,705
Yes, breakfast
is ready, Brother.

177
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,305
Sargam has prepared 'Poha'
which is very tasty.

178
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:52,745
'Poha'.

179
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:55,265
Since today is Tuesday

180
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:57,265
she must have
prepared Parathas too.

181
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:02,065
Brother-in-law, I made
arrangements for Parathas too.

182
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:05,065
But it took so long
to finish other works

183
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:06,745
that I had no time to prepare
anything else other than 'Poha'.

184
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,025
But I have time to
eat Parathas too.

185
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:12,505
You will have time
to eat even 56 dishes.

186
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:17,865
Dear, take time for eating
seeing the menu.

187
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:19,945
Don't ask her to prepare food
since you have time.

188
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:23,425
Nastik, someone
is very happy today.

189
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:25,185
She has saved his money.

190
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:27,425
Go to Prashant's house
and see.

191
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:29,545
Three dishes are prepared
for breakfast.

192
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:32,465
Prashant's three
brothers are married.

193
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:34,825
Sargam is managing
everything alone.

194
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:38,545
Asha Amar Awasthi,
what should I tell you?

195
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,425
You even broke your marriage.

196
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:43,065
Sargam takes care
of your kid too.

197
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:46,345
That's all right, Father-in-law.

198
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,985
You'll get 'Parathas'
for sure next Tuesday.

199
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:50,985
Very nice, Sister-in-law.

200
00:08:51,785 --> 00:08:55,225
Never break the pair of 'Pohe'
and 'Parathas' every Tuesday.

201
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:57,505
You should think of your pair.

202
00:08:58,665 --> 00:09:02,145
He is one more great man who
has taken the vow of celibacy!

203
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:06,465
Dad, this world is an illusion
and marriage is a disturbance.

204
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:08,825
We came alone in this world,
we will have to go alone too.

205
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:13,465
This was said by 'Guruji'!

206
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,225
Alaukik..

207
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:18,465
I say that you shouldn't
get married either.

208
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:22,625
Don't you dare
make him like you.

209
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:26,465
You won't understand
the happiness you get

210
00:09:26,505 --> 00:09:29,305
when you throw money for
your son's marriage.

211
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:32,305
Right! You're getting your kids
in trouble for your enjoyment.

212
00:09:33,065 --> 00:09:34,545
I don't want to eat 'Poha'!

213
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:36,265
Brother-in-law,
you will get 'Parathas'

214
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:37,625
next Tuesday for sure.
- Yes!

215
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:39,905
I was gathering up the
mess that you had made

216
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:41,945
so I only got the
time to make 'Poha'.

217
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:43,145
The mess that we made?

218
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:44,225
What mess did we make?

219
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:45,625
We even washed our shirts.

220
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:51,545
Yes! Everyone listen
to this carefully.

221
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:55,825
Henceforth, no one will speak
of shirts or wash shirts.

222
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:56,945
Got it?

223
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,145
Baby, I told them.

224
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:06,985
You all had taken the
responsibility of killing

225
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:08,785
the cockroaches using
insecticide, right?

226
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:09,785
Did anyone do it?

227
00:10:09,865 --> 00:10:11,625
That day,
Alaukik was putting something

228
00:10:11,665 --> 00:10:12,825
behind the refrigerator.

229
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:19,545
Yes, my 10 rupee coin
had fallen there.

230
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:21,345
I was looking for it.

231
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,705
Did you find it?
It was mine.

232
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:27,705
Father-in-law,
I've been cleaning all

233
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:29,625
the suitcases and
bags since morning

234
00:10:29,665 --> 00:10:31,385
there are cockroaches
everywhere.

235
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,945
If dad gives us some
money to go travel

236
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:35,905
then people may use that bag

237
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:37,385
or else, only the cockroaches
will rest there.

238
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:39,985
Sargam..

239
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:43,265
Coming..
- Come, Dad!

240
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:47,065
For a little 'Poha', a man
has to work all day long here.

241
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:50,585
Sargam, you pour that
insecticide on me.

242
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:51,465
Yes, put it.

243
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:55,265
Yes! I'm the cockroach
of this house, right?

244
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:57,265
No, Brother-in-law,
it's not like that.

245
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:58,105
Then what is it like?

246
00:10:58,185 --> 00:10:59,625
Nothing happens in this house
according to me.

247
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:01,865
I'm trying my best to see that

248
00:11:01,905 --> 00:11:04,305
everything happens
here as per your wish.

249
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:06,065
Does it?

250
00:11:06,865 --> 00:11:08,225
You come to our room
and cry every day.

251
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:09,785
'Brother, she made
curry today too!'

252
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:13,345
Why are you laughing?

253
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:15,465
'Cumin rice..'

254
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,065
What do you say? Even when
you sneeze, cumin comes out.

255
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:22,545
No one is happy with
this system, change it.

256
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:24,265
What do you mean?
- I mean, democracy.

257
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:28,425
Even our government
changes in five years.

258
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:29,785
The house should be
run according to

259
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:30,825
the person who makes
everyone happy.

260
00:11:31,305 --> 00:11:32,345
And who will that be?

261
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,865
It can be anyone.

262
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:35,985
It can be me too.

263
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:38,625
That's very nice,
Brother-in-law.

264
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:41,105
You run the house from now on.
I don't have any problem.

265
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,825
No.. Or people will say that
Asha Amar Awasthi scared

266
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:47,105
his sister-in-law and took
over the reins of the house.

267
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:50,185
It should be a fair selection.

268
00:11:50,265 --> 00:11:51,985
Yes.
Fair selection.

269
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,705
Here's a deck of cards.

270
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:55,305
You pick a card,
sister-in-law will pick one.

271
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:57,065
Whoever picks the bigger card
will run the house.

272
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,865
They're not deciding on
what to get for meal

273
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:03,545
Chinese or Pizza,
to choose using picking a card.

274
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:06,145
This is an important decision
of running the entire house.

275
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:11,025
And important decisions are
never made in this house.

276
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,185
What?
- What?

277
00:12:13,745 --> 00:12:16,105
It's done by voting.
- Yes..

278
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:18,185
That means, election.

279
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,185
Brother Asha against
sister-in-law.

280
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:22,265
No..

281
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:25,465
I mean, my system needs
to be changed, right?

282
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:26,865
So, I can't do it.

283
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:29,305
Appu, you contest the election.

284
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:31,185
Okay..
What! Me?

285
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:34,185
Hey, they like Ms. Sonia
and Mr. Manmohan.sssss

286
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:37,065
I mean, Appu will do what
Sargam tells him to.

287
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:38,945
He got scared of losing
the election already.

288
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:40,865
I'm not scared of anyone.

289
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:42,065
That's fine then.

290
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:43,665
Our second candidate is Appu.

291
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:46,425
Yes, perfect!

292
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:48,905
Beware, Brother Asha.

293
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:50,545
Never forget what
Spiderman said.

294
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:52,465
What?
- Spiderman.

295
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,585
He watches Hindi dubbing.

296
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:57,625
Spiderman says

297
00:12:57,665 --> 00:13:00,385
'With great power comes
great responsibility'.

298
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:01,345
What!

299
00:13:02,185 --> 00:13:03,185
What?

300
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:04,385
Forget all that.

301
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:06,265
The voting will take place
tomorrow morning at 10.

302
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,185
You can campaign as
much as you want today.

303
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:11,665
Tomorrow onwards, the person
who wins will run the house.

304
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:12,585
Yes, absolutely.

305
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:14,905
That person will take all
the decisions of the house

306
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:16,145
like how food will be made

307
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:18,025
who will do what and
how things will be.

308
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,825
Inform about this
to Eklavya too.

309
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:24,745
He may be the youngest but
his vote will count too.

310
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:26,905
Here he is.

311
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:28,185
Breakfast is ready?

312
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:30,065
'Poha'?

313
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:31,145
Today is Tuesday.

314
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:32,785
There will be 'Paratha'
with 'Poha' too. right?

315
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:33,825
No!

316
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:41,265
Sargam.. Baby.. Listen..
This won't work without you.

317
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:43,945
Hey! Your name
means immense power.

318
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:47,425
But you are crumbling under
responsibilities. - Hey..

319
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:49,385
No.. That's not the case.

320
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,745
The thing is, if
Brother Asha wins..

321
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:55,305
He will make everyone
eat jackfruit every day.

322
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:58,745
I love jackfruit.
- No, but.. - Appu..

323
00:13:59,065 --> 00:14:00,585
Relax. It's fine.

324
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:02,345
Everything is fine.

325
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,145
Brother Asha is not
ready to understand

326
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:06,345
at least you try to understand,
Spidey.

327
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:07,825
What..
- Look.

328
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:09,625
With power comes responsibility.

329
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:11,785
But if Brother Asha
gets powerful, he'll forget

330
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:12,985
his responsibility
and become careless.

331
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,865
Then he'll make such
strict rules.. - Yes..

332
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:17,625
Why are you scared?

333
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:19,225
You may win this instead of him.

334
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:21,105
I am not an expert
at running a house.

335
00:14:21,545 --> 00:14:22,545
You'll become one.

336
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,145
I've been trying to be
one for four years now.

337
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:27,185
'Sargam, do this, do that..'

338
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,345
'Sargam, where is this?
Where is that..'

339
00:14:29,425 --> 00:14:30,425
Where is the stapler?

340
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:34,145
Sister-in-law, I am asking you.

341
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:35,745
You are in-charge
till the elections happen.

342
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:37,745
There..

343
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:38,945
Come here.

344
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:41,865
Sit here!

345
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:45,545
Why do you want a stapler?

346
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:46,985
For what?

347
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:51,905
Distances are growing between
India and Pakistan for years now

348
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:54,425
so I thought of stapling
the countries together.

349
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,625
Really?

350
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:59,425
What do you mean why?
I want to staple something.

351
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:01,625
It is kept above the cupboard
containing crockery

352
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:02,865
in the left drawer.

353
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,985
Off you go.

354
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:09,265
Also, shut the cupboard gently.

355
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:13,385
Slam it and the crockery inside
it will come crashing down.

356
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:15,825
Saw that?

357
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:19,745
Saw that? You're teaching people
how to shut a cupboard!

358
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:21,545
I am not kidding..

359
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:24,585
Nobody here knows anything.
You know everything.

360
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:27,585
You are aware of everything.
How will they manage?

361
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:30,265
I will be here and help you out.

362
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:32,185
Passive help.

363
00:15:32,785 --> 00:15:35,225
Don't just sit.
Go and campaign for votes.

364
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,985
Or be prepared to eat jackfruit.

365
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:41,745
My fear has come true.

366
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,785
I am afraid, my fears
may also come true.

367
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:57,825
Dear family members!

368
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:03,425
If I win the election,
every Sunday

369
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,785
you will get ice-cream twice!

370
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:07,825
Ice-cream..
- Yay..

371
00:16:07,985 --> 00:16:10,785
Promise only that
which you can fulfil.

372
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:14,745
For how long will we
have tea in broken cups?

373
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:17,425
If I win the election

374
00:16:18,305 --> 00:16:20,945
I'll get new crockery
from the storeroom.

375
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:28,465
Please tell him
that changing crockery

376
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:30,905
won't turn tea into cappuccino!

377
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:33,585
To have good tea,
we need to do away with

378
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:37,105
the terrible tea leaves
dad brings in wholesale.

379
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,865
If I win, I'll get
premium tea leaves.

380
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:45,065
Forget the tea leaves.

381
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,145
I'll get better rice.

382
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:51,585
We shall not have
the useless rice anymore.

383
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:55,385
Four times a week,
I'll get basmati rice for all.

384
00:16:58,825 --> 00:17:01,705
Sargam, I will press
all clothes for you.

385
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,425
Ekalavya, I will massage
grandpa's feet for an year now.

386
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:13,985
Dad, I'll keep the accounts
and save your money.

387
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:16,305
Forget it, you fat-headed.

388
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:22,625
For how long will you rub
used soaps on your body?

389
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:27,305
I'll get you a personal soap.

390
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:29,145
What should I bathe with now?

391
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:35,425
You will be free from
washing the tank every month.

392
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:40,185
Brother, I will perform
all the asanas you teach me.

393
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:41,305
Master!

394
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:57,465
One, two, three, four, five

395
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,305
six, seven, eight..

396
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,345
The voting is complete.
Now count them..

397
00:18:08,345 --> 00:18:11,385
I mean, count the votes..

398
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:13,625
Oh, I am sorry..

399
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:27,825
Only one.

400
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:29,945
Did Asha win?

401
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:35,345
Who won? Tell me.
- Brother Appu gets..

402
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:38,225
Zero votes.

403
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,385
Congratulations, Mr. Asha!

404
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:46,945
You won with majority.

405
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:49,265
Now the house is
in your control.

406
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:51,345
No, Sister-in-law.
That's the wrong vibe.

407
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,945
He has got just one vote.

408
00:18:57,985 --> 00:19:00,105
What do you mean?
Mr. Asha got one.

409
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:01,185
Appu got zero.
Then he..

410
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,945
All the chits has your name.
- Okay..

411
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,705
You all have written my name
on the chits.

412
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,785
Great!

413
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:20,785
I thought I am the only person.

414
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,905
Yes, Grandpa, even I thought
it was just..

415
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:28,065
But everybody has..

416
00:19:29,145 --> 00:19:31,825
What's all this?
- You won this battle.

417
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:35,105
Why did you do this?

418
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,185
Listen..
- Sargam..

419
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:45,025
Sargam, what's wrong?

420
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,825
Sister-in-law, I thought
you will be free.

421
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:53,625
Then I read a survey report.

422
00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:56,065
Every year 4.5 percent of people

423
00:19:56,185 --> 00:19:58,265
die in kitchen because
of gas leakage.

424
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:01,945
If they forgot to switch it off
then we are all gone.

425
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:05,985
Grandpa can't even run.
- No, I..

426
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:10,265
I can't run.

427
00:20:11,185 --> 00:20:13,185
Listen, Sister-in-law.

428
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,185
I am a celibate.

429
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:17,625
I follow all the rules
with honesty.

430
00:20:17,705 --> 00:20:19,905
But I have read a book.

431
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:24,145
All the necessary things
in this world are feminine.

432
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:26,105
For example, pen.

433
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:29,825
Books, earth

434
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:31,705
and the crops on land.

435
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:34,425
Even roti..
- That's enough.

436
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,145
Come to the point.

437
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:41,785
All these things
are feminine.

438
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:45,345
So how would men run this house?

439
00:20:50,065 --> 00:20:51,745
Nice.
Very nice.

440
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:53,545
But I never thought so deep.

441
00:20:53,945 --> 00:20:56,465
What's there to think?
It's you, Sister-in-law.

442
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:59,705
You never let us realise
our mom's absence.

443
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:06,905
Right.

444
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:09,905
These fools can become
a part of this circus.

445
00:21:10,065 --> 00:21:11,985
But they can't run it.

446
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:15,505
Even you are not perfect.

447
00:21:16,705 --> 00:21:18,505
But who wants perfect?

448
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:22,225
Manage what you can.
Leave the rest.

449
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:25,625
Imperfection makes a house.

450
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,465
Only hotels are perfect.

451
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:33,145
Like I said..
It's fine.

452
00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:34,785
Everything is fine.

453
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,745
Come on, Brother Asha!
You voted yourself.

454
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:43,385
It was a waste.
- I didn't vote myself.

455
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:47,425
What!
It wasn't you!

456
00:21:49,105 --> 00:21:52,345
We all wrote her name
then who..

457
00:21:57,865 --> 00:21:59,225
Sister-in-law!

458
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:05,865
I voted him.

459
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:12,745
That means even he has
voted sister-in-law.

460
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:17,505
It wasn't intentional.

461
00:22:17,665 --> 00:22:19,505
Yesterday I saw your diary.

462
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:21,585
I thought I should have a look.

463
00:22:21,745 --> 00:22:24,865
I thought it would be as usual.

464
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:27,625
But I saw a list for whole week.

465
00:22:27,985 --> 00:22:30,905
I looked at it carefully.
And I didn't find it usual.

466
00:22:31,705 --> 00:22:35,505
There were so many little things

467
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:37,785
which are essential
for the house.

468
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,865
If you start reading
it will need the entire day.

469
00:22:42,225 --> 00:22:44,385
Monday's list was covering
the page of tuesday.

470
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:49,905
These are the works
which we think are easy.

471
00:22:51,985 --> 00:22:54,345
But today I learnt
how difficult they are.

472
00:22:55,065 --> 00:22:58,585
It needs courage.
It really needs hard work.

473
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:02,305
The hard work for which
we never thank her.

474
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:08,385
You have been doing this
since four years.

475
00:23:09,505 --> 00:23:12,705
But we only know
how to quarrel for food.

476
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:17,185
I don't think we could have
managed it.

477
00:23:17,825 --> 00:23:19,145
But I have understood.

478
00:23:19,225 --> 00:23:20,665
Sargam, nobody can do

479
00:23:20,785 --> 00:23:22,705
what you do here.

480
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:25,825
About my vote.

481
00:23:26,465 --> 00:23:27,825
That's not a big deal.

482
00:23:28,785 --> 00:23:32,785
Yes, the lockdown taught
all the men.

483
00:23:32,865 --> 00:23:35,865
There's no holiday
in the life of wives.

484
00:23:40,305 --> 00:23:42,945
People say 7:30 is a bad time.

485
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:45,785
But in my case
it's the opposite.

486
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:49,745
Appu proposed me
at 7:30 p.m.

487
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,265
Also, before this marriage

488
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:57,745
our affair lasted
for seven and half months.

489
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:02,345
Even the circumambulations.

490
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,305
I mean we did extra half.

491
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:14,625
Now you all have
become my world.

492
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:20,985
It might be bad for others.

493
00:24:22,265 --> 00:24:25,625
But for me it's a path
for happiness.

494
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:29,905
Aunt..

495
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:32,665
Come, dear.

496
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:36,585
Aunt, I am extremely hungry.
- Okay.

497
00:24:37,105 --> 00:24:38,825
Please prepare something
within ten minutes.

498
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:41,105
What can I prepare
in such less time..

499
00:24:42,185 --> 00:24:45,305
'Poha' is the only option.
- What!
