1
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,032
Stop! Stop!

2
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:35,653
Switch off! Switch on!

3
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,798
Start!

4
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:42,082
Stop! Stop! Once again.

5
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:45,265
Switch off! Switch on!

6
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,632
Start!

7
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:54,259
A guitarist like you
will not be able to turn this handle!

8
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:55,852
Jaggu!
- Coming, brother.

9
00:04:56,115 --> 00:04:58,523
You can't even turn the handle,
give it to me.

10
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:07,545
Get up!

11
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:10,770
You eat 50 breads with the cream!
Still you don't have strength!

12
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,573
I do eat but...
- I think there's a problem with the car.

13
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:16,242
What?! Is the dynamo clean?
- Yes.

14
00:05:16,322 --> 00:05:17,245
Carburetor?
- Yes.

15
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:18,013
Engine?
- Yes.

16
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:18,711
Battery?
- Yes.

17
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,143
Armature?
- Yes.

18
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:21,520
Hen?
- Yes.

19
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,357
Harmonium? Tabla?
- Yes.

20
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:26,723
You are just bluffing!
Why isn't the car starting?

21
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:30,160
Why is the car not starting?

22
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:35,382
I think one of us has seen
a woman, early in the morning.

23
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,703
Have you?

24
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:40,700
No. I saw myself in the mirror.
But Mannu may have.

25
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,812
Me?! When you are coming down,
I just saw your face.

26
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:45,361
Does that mean, I have?

27
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:48,129
Look that girl is watching us.
No wonder the car is not moving!

28
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:52,386
Till the time she keeps staring here,
the car is not going to start.

29
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:54,183
Get rid of her. Chase her away.
- Yes.

30
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:56,100
You go.
- You go!

31
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,948
Why me?
- You go.

32
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:58,730
Should I go?
- Please do so.

33
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:04,623
No one needs to go.
Let's use our old trick.

34
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:22,189
The car will now start and speed away!
- Yes, it will!

35
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:23,590
Come on.
- Let's go.

36
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,444
Come on. Start!

37
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,748
Hail Lord Hanuman!

38
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:41,469
The car's gone!
- It's gone!

39
00:06:41,549 --> 00:06:45,369
Come on brother. Catch it!

40
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:55,551
"Move aside."

41
00:06:55,631 --> 00:07:01,596
"The honk hoots aloud
so move aside."

42
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:07,286
"What's mobile here is called a car."

43
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:12,830
"The honk hoots aloud
so move aside."

44
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,470
"What's mobile here is called a car."

45
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:37,607
"The greatest truth of all is this.."

46
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:41,430
"..come what may
success will be ours."

47
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,183
"The greatest truth of all is this.."

48
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:48,383
"..come what may
success will be ours."

49
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:52,929
"In a tattered state it may be,
it's fine as long as it's mobile."

50
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:56,633
"True or untrue it may be,
it's fine as long as it's mobile."

51
00:07:56,713 --> 00:08:00,335
"In a tattered state it may be,
it's fine as long as it's mobile."

52
00:08:00,415 --> 00:08:03,326
"True or untrue it may be,
it's fine as long as it's mobile."

53
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:10,802
"Turn to the left
and turn to the right."

54
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:15,109
"Turn to the left
and turn to the right."

55
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:17,055
"Move aside."

56
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:23,236
"The honk hoots aloud
so move aside."

57
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:29,018
"What's mobile here is called a car."

58
00:08:57,612 --> 00:09:01,346
"A matter so trivial,
the world failed to fathom."

59
00:09:01,426 --> 00:09:04,591
"As long as man moves on
every treasure can be won."

60
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:08,793
"A matter so trivial,
the world failed to fathom."

61
00:09:08,873 --> 00:09:12,140
"As long as man moves on
every treasure can be won."

62
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:16,542
"What is fame? To move on
is the name of the game."

63
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:20,305
"What is honor? To move on
is the name of the game."

64
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:24,059
"What is fame? To move on
is the name of the game."

65
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:27,042
"What is honor? To move on
is the name of the game."

66
00:09:27,122 --> 00:09:34,562
"Turn to the left
and turn to the right."

67
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:38,954
"Turn to the left
and turn to the right."

68
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:40,919
"Move aside."

69
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:47,057
"The honk hoots aloud
so move aside."

70
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:52,709
"What's mobile here is called a car."

71
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:29,289
"Always stay together like this."

72
00:10:29,617 --> 00:10:33,449
"United we stand,
Divided we fall."

73
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,865
"Always be together like this."

74
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:41,017
"United we stand,
Divided we fall."

75
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:44,881
"If problems are strewn your way
with a brave face, challenge it."

76
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:48,628
"If huge hurdles block your way,
together move it aside."

77
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:52,303
"If problems are strewn your way
with a brave face, challenge it."

78
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:55,847
"If huge hurdles block your way,
together move it aside."

79
00:10:56,132 --> 00:10:59,738
"The one who fathoms this
achieves success."

80
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:02,783
"The one who fathoms this
achieves success."

81
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,212
"The one who fathoms this
achieves success."

82
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,080
"The one who fathoms this
achieves success."

83
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,628
"Move aside."

84
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:15,037
"The honk hoots aloud
so move aside."

85
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:20,785
"What's mobile here is called a car."

86
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:26,468
"The honk hoots aloud
so move aside."

87
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:32,237
"What's mobile here is called a car."

88
00:11:43,615 --> 00:11:45,879
Jaggu, fill oil in this.
- Yes, brother.

89
00:11:46,726 --> 00:11:48,574
Mannu, fill oil.

90
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:54,721
Sir, has our car been repaired?

91
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,787
It's in top condition!
We'll win the race this year too!

92
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:57,503
Really?

93
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,682
Yes, clean the car
and check the oil.

94
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,719
Certainly!
Sir, I need a holiday tonight.

95
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,605
Why?!

96
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:07,971
Raman Circus from Madras will be
showing good exercises tonight.

97
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:11,365
Some of my friends are going.
I also need Champion, our car.

98
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:13,177
Indeed! Who'll do the work?

99
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:17,727
I've changed the fuse, filled oil
and cleaned the cars!

100
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:18,937
Very good! Very good!

101
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:23,359
How awful! Mannu!
- Yes?

102
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,485
Come here.
- Okay. Move aside.

103
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:30,090
Look at this!

104
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:32,722
It's a lovely picture.

105
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,699
Did you put it there?
- No. - Then?

106
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:36,879
I did.
- Why?

107
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,442
Our driver Vithal gave it to me.
He told me it was lovely.

108
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:44,396
I put one here. I'll put the other
with a swimming costume, there.

109
00:12:44,476 --> 00:12:46,507
I'll smash your head! Jaggu!
- Jaggu sir.

110
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:47,821
Coming, brother.

111
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:50,494
Look at this disgusting picture.
- Awful!

112
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:52,733
Have you ever seen a woman's
photograph in this house?

113
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,567
Have you?
- No. - No.

114
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:57,160
If I wanted to put up such a picture,
wouldn't I have done so?

115
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,683
Yes. But why didn't you?

116
00:12:58,763 --> 00:13:01,434
Because I don't want anyone
in our home to befriend women!

117
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,966
Nobody should befriend a woman.

118
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:04,306
What if a woman comes
here with a car?

119
00:13:04,386 --> 00:13:05,491
Suppose it's an emergency?

120
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:08,717
That's a different case. But burn
this photograph with Mobil Oil!

121
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:12,625
Mannu, burn this photograph
with Mobil Oil.

122
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:16,007
Mojha, burn this photograph
with Mobil Oil.

123
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:20,842
Boss, can I get an off?
- An off?!

124
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:23,409
Why did you put the picture there?
I got slapped!

125
00:13:23,489 --> 00:13:26,800
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
May I take Champion?

126
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,527
Go.

127
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,663
I'll burn this first.
I've got a holiday!

128
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,252
You've given Mojha a holiday?
- He wants to go to the circus.

129
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,890
But who will stay here at night?
- You will.

130
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:38,952
Why should I?
You gave him an off, so you will stay.

131
00:13:39,032 --> 00:13:42,109
The day you give him an off,
I'll stay back.

132
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,625
No, I won't stay.
- I won't stay either!

133
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:46,311
I won't stay!
- I certainly won't stay!

134
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:47,409
I won't!

135
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:51,925
I'm a deep sleeper. So if a
customer returns, don't complain!

136
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:55,566
That will bring us disrepute.
It'll fetch all of us a bad name.

137
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:56,725
Think about it.

138
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,173
Let's toss.
- Okay.

139
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:00,557
Fine?
- Absolutely.

140
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:03,415
Heads I win, tails you lose.

141
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:06,478
Heads I win, tails you lose.
- Okay.

142
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,272
Ready?

143
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,835
Look.
- Tails.

144
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:12,787
You lose.
- Damn!

145
00:14:15,274 --> 00:14:17,350
Heads I win, tails you lose?

146
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,531
Who's it?

147
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,545
Who the hell is it?!

148
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,985
Why is he knocking at this hour?

149
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:58,192
Hey! Why don't you tell me
who you are?

150
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,991
Just you wait!

151
00:15:12,498 --> 00:15:13,708
What are you looking at!

152
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:16,459
I thought it must be a ghost!
- What!

153
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:18,422
It's the middle of the night.

154
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,046
I was sleeping so peacefully!

155
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,001
You were sleeping?
- Yes.

156
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:26,761
You were sleeping?!
- Yes, I was.

157
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:29,353
You were sleeping with the
'Day and night service' indicator on?!

158
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,695
Is the indicator on?

159
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:34,993
I will complain about you!

160
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:37,751
Idiot.

161
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,972
The indicator has been turned off.
Now you also buzz off!

162
00:15:42,052 --> 00:15:44,766
Come and complain in the morning.

163
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:52,276
I wonder where she came from!
The girls nowadays are such a pain!

164
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:54,087
Excuse me!

165
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:55,811
You haven't left yet?

166
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:58,792
Please open the door!
I'm in big trouble.

167
00:15:58,872 --> 00:16:00,124
Very good!

168
00:16:00,204 --> 00:16:01,817
My car has broken down.

169
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:04,195
Get it repaired when you
come to complain tomorrow!

170
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:07,243
Please! I said that in anger.

171
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:14,605
Please open the door.
I am a girl. You ought to help me.

172
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:18,555
I ought to help you, indeed!

173
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:21,816
Have you cooled down, madam?

174
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:25,205
Absolutely? Sure?

175
00:16:25,637 --> 00:16:26,804
Where is the car?

176
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,534
Parked on the road.

177
00:16:29,295 --> 00:16:30,402
The road?

178
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,420
Where is the driver?
- I, myself, drive.

179
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:37,832
No wonder!
It had to break down!

180
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,510
Come with me.

181
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:47,941
Come here.

182
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:52,840
Start.

183
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,344
Once again.

184
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,853
I can't figure out this way.

185
00:17:00,615 --> 00:17:02,691
Pardon?
- I can't figure out.

186
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:06,189
Then?
- I'll have to open the bonnet.

187
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:07,357
Go ahead!

188
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:12,364
How can I open it here?
I need light.

189
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:14,557
You mean, the car has
to be taken to the garage?

190
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:16,023
Obviously!

191
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,462
Who will push it?
- That's a good question.

192
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,879
I can't see a soul in these rains.

193
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:31,385
You're right.
I don't spot a soul.

194
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:34,780
You push it!
- What? - You push it.

195
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,915
I knew it! If you can disturb
my sleep at midnight, you can...

196
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:43,481
Just shut up! Take care of
the steering wheel. I'll push!

197
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:44,940
Really? Let's go.

198
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,695
Push, madam.

199
00:17:50,345 --> 00:17:53,556
Come on! Push harder!

200
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:55,699
Very good!

201
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:04,510
"A stormy, rainy night it is.
Look at the trouble it's brought.."

202
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:08,514
That's enough.

203
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:25,418
It will take some time.
Go and sit somewhere. Go!

204
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:37,941
Oh dear! You're drenched.
There aren't any dry clothes here.

205
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:42,024
My coat's over there,
you may wear it.

206
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:44,958
Pardon? No, thank you!

207
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:47,154
Your wish.

208
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:52,460
Even the car is dripping wet
just like madam!

209
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,089
Where was the misfire?

210
00:19:04,403 --> 00:19:06,555
Oh, so you were misfiring?

211
00:19:07,258 --> 00:19:11,615
Look, there's a flask kept.
Bring it here.

212
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:13,922
Me?!
- Yes.

213
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:15,990
Fetch it yourself!

214
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:17,544
So you won't go?

215
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:20,118
I am not your servant!

216
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,279
Is that so?

217
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:29,425
Even I'm nobody's servant.

218
00:19:29,505 --> 00:19:32,500
The work will be done
only after the flask is brought.

219
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:01,683
Careful! It will break.

220
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:12,765
It's hot tea. Just gulp it.

221
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:16,387
I don't drink tea.
- No? Thank God!

222
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:29,963
Excuse me.

223
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:31,553
Yes?

224
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,223
Please remove a
cigarette from my pocket.

225
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:40,069
My hands are dirty.
Remove it.

226
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:47,520
Match stick.

227
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:54,949
Where is it?
- It's not there?

228
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:58,091
Anyway, the cigarettes are wet.
- Serves you right!

229
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:16,451
She's shivering with cold but
her head has not cooled down yet!

230
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:40,273
"A girl, drenched to the core."

231
00:21:40,353 --> 00:21:43,694
"Wide awake in the dead of night."

232
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:48,440
"Met a stranger
with not a soul around."

233
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,340
"Is it something very wise to do?"

234
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:57,760
"A girl, drenched to the core."

235
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,544
"Wide awake in the dead of night."

236
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:05,976
"Met a stranger
with not a soul around."

237
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:09,825
"Is it something very wise to do?"

238
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:23,036
"Flames of anger burn
from deep within."

239
00:22:23,116 --> 00:22:26,766
"Seething with rage she comes."

240
00:22:28,735 --> 00:22:32,432
"Flames of anger burn
from deep within."

241
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:35,793
"Seething with rage she comes."

242
00:22:36,215 --> 00:22:42,615
"Fretting and fuming
on a lonely, rainy night."

243
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:47,772
"Met a stranger
with not a soul around."

244
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,847
"Is it something very wise to do?"

245
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:57,144
"A girl, drenched to the core."

246
00:22:57,224 --> 00:23:00,939
"Wide awake in the dead of night."

247
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:05,285
"Met a stranger
with not a soul around."

248
00:23:05,365 --> 00:23:09,165
"Is it something very wise to do?"

249
00:23:22,354 --> 00:23:26,137
"Swaying hither and thither."

250
00:23:26,217 --> 00:23:29,671
"Seeming so lost."

251
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:35,455
"Swaying hither and thither."

252
00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:38,990
"Seeming so lost."

253
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:45,693
"With all the zeal
she set out on a night so stormy."

254
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:50,786
"Met a stranger
with not a soul around."

255
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:54,602
"Is it something very wise to do?"

256
00:23:56,148 --> 00:24:00,051
"A girl, drenched to the core."

257
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:03,792
"Wide awake in the dead of night."

258
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:08,190
"Met a stranger
with not a soul around."

259
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,082
"Is it something very wise to do?"

260
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:32,950
"Soaking wet from head to toe."

261
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,680
"She's as crazy as can be."

262
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:42,031
"Soaking wet from head to toe."

263
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:45,912
"She's as crazy as can be."

264
00:24:45,992 --> 00:24:52,529
"She stands, bends, walks, stops
and set out on a night so dark."

265
00:24:53,264 --> 00:24:57,729
"Met a stranger
with not a soul around."

266
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:01,491
"Is it something very wise to do?"

267
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,768
"A girl, drenched to the core."

268
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:10,455
"Wide awake in the dead of night."

269
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:15,017
"Met a stranger
with not a soul around."

270
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,807
"Is it something very wise to do?"

271
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:24,411
Start the car, madam.

272
00:25:31,968 --> 00:25:33,414
That's it!

273
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:37,046
Sorry for the trouble, madam.
You had to wait long.

274
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:40,678
I have never seen
a man as strange as you.

275
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:45,383
Well, you have now. People say
I am a bit mad. What do you think?

276
00:25:45,748 --> 00:25:49,017
You, and mad?
You could make a sane man go insane!

277
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:54,666
That's nice!

278
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:57,474
My charges!

279
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,412
She's gone!

280
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:07,247
Cheat! She got the work done for free!

281
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,577
How will she get away now?!

282
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,618
Why is he sleeping here?

283
00:26:24,794 --> 00:26:27,111
Hey, Mannu! Wake up.
Why are you sleeping here?

284
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,665
What's the time?
- It's 9 a.m. Why didn't you go home?

285
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,085
A girl had come last night.
I'm waiting for her.

286
00:26:35,165 --> 00:26:36,131
What is he talking!
- What rubbish!

287
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:38,510
Fool! Which girl are you waiting for?

288
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,816
I mean, it was an emergency case.

289
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:40,940
Emergency.
- Emergency.

290
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,101
She had come to get her car repaired.

291
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:43,950
But why are you waiting for her?

292
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,404
She left without paying.

293
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:47,652
Did you use any spare parts?
- Did she steal anything?

294
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,545
No, but my hard work went to a waste.

295
00:26:50,056 --> 00:26:52,131
She left her bag behind.
She will surely come back.

296
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,613
It's a nice bag!

297
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:57,741
What were the charges?
- Five rupees and twelve annas.

298
00:26:58,056 --> 00:27:00,139
Then take five rupees and twelve annas
from this bag..

299
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,918
..and debit the amount
from the company account.

300
00:27:03,212 --> 00:27:05,037
Very well, brother.
- What's wrong?

301
00:27:05,117 --> 00:27:06,766
How can I open the bag
without the girl's permission?

302
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:09,309
Nonsense! Obey older brother.
- Take it.

303
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:10,930
You open it, brother!

304
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:13,222
This is not being decent.
How can I do it?

305
00:27:13,302 --> 00:27:16,206
Absolutely.
What nonsense you talk!

306
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:18,658
You open it.
- How can I?

307
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:21,230
I never touch a girl's bag.
- I say, open it!

308
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,759
I'm doing it at your behest.
Otherwise I don't even touch it.

309
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:27,487
A bullet!
- A bullet?

310
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:29,519
There may be a revolver.
Hold this!

311
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,560
It's a lipstick, not a bullet. Look.

312
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,457
It looks just like a bullet.
- Empty the bag.

313
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:42,924
There's not a single penny.
She made a fool of you, idiot!

314
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:45,148
Cheque! I'm sorry.

315
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:46,930
A show for an invitation!

316
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,357
An invitation for a show!

317
00:27:49,194 --> 00:27:50,754
She will surely go for it.

318
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:53,899
Return her bag and ask for
five rupees and twelve annas from her.

319
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:59,592
Fine. But I have never seen her.
He's at fault, so he should go.

320
00:27:59,672 --> 00:28:01,356
I understand. You go.

321
00:28:01,436 --> 00:28:02,456
All right.

322
00:28:03,093 --> 00:28:06,068
You also come along.
- No way! I keep away from girls.

323
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:07,196
Let's toss.

324
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:08,551
Toss? Alright.

325
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:10,689
Heads I win, tails you lose.

326
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:14,352
Hey, you've understood now!

327
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:16,820
Fine, I'll go.

328
00:28:38,372 --> 00:28:41,971
This is a stage pass.
Please go over there.

329
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:51,436
Ms. Renu.

330
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:55,269
Excuse me, is this yours?
- Yes.

331
00:28:55,349 --> 00:28:57,484
But it's in Ms. Renu's name.
- She's the one I want to meet.

332
00:28:57,564 --> 00:28:59,567
You can't go in without work.

333
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:01,752
I have important work with her.
- What work?

334
00:29:01,832 --> 00:29:02,901
I want to recover
five rupees and twelve annas from her.

335
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:05,454
Five rupees and twelve annas!
Have you gone mad?

336
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:08,091
Step out!
- If I don't take my money...

337
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:10,238
Wait out until the show is over.
- I can't wait. I...

338
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:11,979
Watchman!
- What will he do?

339
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:52,783
Yes! Where will she go now!

340
00:29:53,302 --> 00:29:55,329
I'll surely take
five rupees and twelve annas from her!

341
00:30:21,524 --> 00:30:24,230
O' God! It's 12:15 am.

342
00:30:28,251 --> 00:30:31,102
Bye, Sheela. I must leave.
It's very late.

343
00:30:31,182 --> 00:30:33,469
If the car breaks down again like
last night, I'll be in trouble.

344
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:35,891
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Come in the morning itself.

345
00:30:35,971 --> 00:30:38,383
You have to spend the entire day
with me. Have lunch and...

346
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:39,636
Will you come with me for
shopping also? - Yes.

347
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:41,441
And to roam around?
- Yes.

348
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:43,565
Pray that my car runs fine.
- Yes, I will.

349
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:45,364
Good night.
- Good night.

350
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,373
"I'm a melody of the stars.
A tale of the springs."

351
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:30,595
"Cast your eye on me
and drive yourself crazy."

352
00:31:31,146 --> 00:31:35,830
"I'm a melody of the stars.
A tale of the springs."

353
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:41,062
"Cast your eye on me
and drive yourself crazy."

354
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:49,793
"Beauty unleashed you sure are.
The love of my life you sure are."

355
00:31:49,873 --> 00:31:54,835
"But five rupees and twelve annas
is what you must pay me first."

356
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:59,407
"Five rupees and twelve annas."

357
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:03,379
"Else, brother will thrash me."

358
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,355
"Forget about the money."

359
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:23,441
"And seek my heart instead."

360
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:27,742
"My darling, what did you say?"

361
00:32:28,189 --> 00:32:32,678
"Let alone my heart,
seek my youth instead."

362
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:37,435
"I can become a Romeo for you.
I can chant your name all day."

363
00:32:37,515 --> 00:32:41,231
"See for yourself an example of it."

364
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:46,100
"My blood gets shed for you.
My heart gets broken for you."

365
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,795
"My blood gets shed for you.
My heart gets broken for you."

366
00:32:50,875 --> 00:33:00,178
"This is the punishment
your lover gets."

367
00:33:00,915 --> 00:33:05,749
"This ardent thing called love
is a feeling, so wonderful."

368
00:33:05,829 --> 00:33:10,988
"Cast your eye on me
and drive yourself crazy."

369
00:33:11,587 --> 00:33:16,233
"This ardent thing called love
sure is a feeling, so wonderful."

370
00:33:16,313 --> 00:33:21,188
"But five rupees and twelve annas
is what you must pay me first."

371
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:25,608
"Five rupees and twelve annas."

372
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:30,226
"Else, brother will thrash me."

373
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:44,559
"Leave behind your woes,
create a melody instead."

374
00:33:45,397 --> 00:33:49,705
"And sing a song of my beauty."

375
00:33:49,785 --> 00:33:53,891
"O' my darling."

376
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:58,820
"Continue to make such requests."

377
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:03,708
"A song I can sing for you.
A melody I can create for you."

378
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:07,598
"See for yourself an example of it."

379
00:34:10,635 --> 00:34:14,418
"Tread slowly and deliberately."

380
00:34:14,498 --> 00:34:22,085
"Tread slowly and deliberately
in the garden, O' bee."

381
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:29,264
"A great admirer of art you are."

382
00:34:29,344 --> 00:34:31,546
"Excuses galore you can make."

383
00:34:31,626 --> 00:34:36,615
"Cast your eye on me
and drive yourself crazy."

384
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:41,674
"An excuse so good, it sure is.
A great admirer of art I am."

385
00:34:41,754 --> 00:34:46,431
"But five rupees and twelve annas
is what you must pay me first."

386
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:50,863
"Five rupees and twelve annas."

387
00:34:50,943 --> 00:34:54,993
"Else, brother will thrash me."

388
00:35:05,249 --> 00:35:09,096
"Fall in love,
devoid of any worries."

389
00:35:09,768 --> 00:35:13,305
"Money is nothing
but a fleeting possession."

390
00:35:13,385 --> 00:35:18,106
"O' my darling, it's true."

391
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:22,794
"Everything is an illusion
except your love."

392
00:35:23,216 --> 00:35:27,725
"I can become a recluse for you,
and wander the jungles so dense."

393
00:35:27,805 --> 00:35:31,206
"See for yourself an example of it."

394
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:40,266
"Your sack is going to burst apart.
So beware!

395
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:44,655
"Your sack is going to burst apart.
So beware!

396
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:48,375
"Your sack is going to burst apart."

397
00:35:49,131 --> 00:35:51,613
"The love of your life I am."

398
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:53,888
"Come and embrace me."

399
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:58,959
"Cast your eye on me
and drive yourself crazy."

400
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,857
"The love of my life you sure are."

401
00:36:03,937 --> 00:36:08,366
But first pay me...
One, two, three, four, five."

402
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:10,981
"Five rupees and twelve annas."

403
00:36:11,061 --> 00:36:15,305
"Five rupees and twelve annas."

404
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:19,532
"Else, brother will thrash me."

405
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:23,846
"Five rupees and twelve annas."

406
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:46,528
This looks like a garage.

407
00:36:47,782 --> 00:36:49,566
But how did I get here?

408
00:37:06,738 --> 00:37:09,586
It's 2 O'clock. O' God!

409
00:37:20,136 --> 00:37:21,840
I'm badly trapped!

410
00:38:32,499 --> 00:38:33,927
Hey, who's in there?!

411
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:05,417
Hey, Ramu! Where are you? Get up!
There's a thief in the house!

412
00:39:05,497 --> 00:39:10,901
Get up, Ramu!
There's a thief in the house!

413
00:39:56,781 --> 00:39:57,870
Who is it?
- Who is it?

414
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:58,874
Who is it?
- Who are you?

415
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:00,551
Who is it?
- Who are you?

416
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:04,183
Oh, it's you!

417
00:40:06,544 --> 00:40:07,807
Where is it?

418
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:13,819
Here's your bag.
And please show me the way out.

419
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:16,976
Who are you?

420
00:40:17,056 --> 00:40:18,758
Didn't you recognise me?

421
00:40:19,423 --> 00:40:22,831
You had come to my garage last night.
I had repaired your car.

422
00:40:23,393 --> 00:40:25,411
Oh yes!

423
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:26,691
Then give my five rupees
and twelve annas.

424
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,848
But how did you get here?
- You brought me along?

425
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,561
What!

426
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:31,467
I was sleeping in your car
and you didn't even see me.

427
00:40:31,547 --> 00:40:33,694
In my car? Are you in your senses?

428
00:40:33,774 --> 00:40:34,750
No, I'm mad.

429
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,251
Or I wouldn't take the trouble to collect
five rupees and twelve annas.

430
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:39,009
Where is he?
Where has he gone?

431
00:40:40,348 --> 00:40:43,295
What happened?
- There's a thief in the house!

432
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,554
Where is the thief?
- I don't know.

433
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:48,571
You don't know? Do you think
he went this way? Come on.

434
00:40:51,476 --> 00:40:53,622
Show me a place to hide.

435
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:54,858
There's none!

436
00:40:54,938 --> 00:40:57,728
They will thrash me.
- Good!

437
00:40:57,808 --> 00:41:00,236
You come at midnight to ask for
five rupees and twelve annas.

438
00:41:00,316 --> 00:41:03,635
If you open the door,
I'll tell all of them.

439
00:41:03,715 --> 00:41:06,822
What?
- That you brought me here.

440
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:09,345
What! I brought you here!

441
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:13,366
Yes, you did. Open the door.
I'll tell them everything.

442
00:41:13,446 --> 00:41:18,031
Renu! My dear, open the door.

443
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:19,568
Renu!

444
00:41:19,648 --> 00:41:22,344
I'm coming, father.
- Open the door.

445
00:41:22,424 --> 00:41:25,239
Listen... wait.

446
00:41:27,076 --> 00:41:28,477
Open the door.

447
00:41:29,064 --> 00:41:30,803
Wait. Let me hide.

448
00:41:31,564 --> 00:41:35,663
Renu! Renu! Open the door, Renu.

449
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,168
Yes, father.

450
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:40,264
What's the matter, father?

451
00:41:40,344 --> 00:41:42,780
Are you all right?

452
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,164
Absolutely fine.

453
00:41:44,244 --> 00:41:45,755
Then why did you scream?

454
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:48,419
Me? I didn't scream, father.

455
00:41:48,499 --> 00:41:50,114
But I heard you.

456
00:41:50,194 --> 00:41:52,338
I didn't hear anything.
I did see, though.

457
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:55,200
You did?
- Yes. I had seen a dream.

458
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,786
Dream!
- What is this pistol for?

459
00:41:57,866 --> 00:41:59,706
There's a thief in the house.

460
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:03,014
There's no one in my room.
I was sleeping peacefully.

461
00:42:03,094 --> 00:42:06,487
How would you know then!
He must be hiding somewhere here.

462
00:42:06,994 --> 00:42:08,309
No, father.

463
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,497
Father, you have woke up just now.

464
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:15,658
You heart is beating so fast!
- Is it?

465
00:42:16,296 --> 00:42:19,165
You got scared.
- Scared my foot.

466
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:23,511
I'll shoot that thief!
Move aside. Let me take a look.

467
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,218
Why don't you come out?!

468
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,447
There's nobody here, father.

469
00:42:28,527 --> 00:42:31,523
I wonder where he's gone!

470
00:42:35,896 --> 00:42:37,228
What a problem...

471
00:42:37,308 --> 00:42:38,945
You'll break the legs.
- Legs?

472
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:41,232
The bed's poles are very weak.

473
00:42:42,631 --> 00:42:46,090
Father, I think
he's hiding on the roof.

474
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,403
I'll shoot him!

475
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:51,743
On the terrace.
- Okay, I'll go there.

476
00:42:51,927 --> 00:42:55,029
Lock your door. And don't worry.

477
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:58,739
Chaubey! Pathan!
Everybody come with me!

478
00:43:08,031 --> 00:43:09,068
Get out!

479
00:43:14,279 --> 00:43:18,463
I'm going. Let me catch my breath.
My back is broken.

480
00:43:18,543 --> 00:43:19,749
Get out!

481
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:24,939
Thief! Thief!

482
00:45:55,878 --> 00:46:00,728
After that, I remained in the
midst of beggars for a long time.

483
00:46:01,118 --> 00:46:04,732
I could leave only after the cops
came and took the corpse away.

484
00:46:04,812 --> 00:46:07,931
The story is very good!
I have surely read it before.

485
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:10,941
Indeed! Had you been in my place,
you would have known!

486
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:13,796
The question that now arises...
- The question that now arises..

487
00:46:13,876 --> 00:46:17,536
..is that as per the law, you
should tell the cops everything.

488
00:46:17,616 --> 00:46:19,766
But it was the police
who took the dead body away.

489
00:46:19,846 --> 00:46:23,510
Yes, it could mean more trouble.
That's why I'm quiet. However...

490
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,914
You couldn't get five rupees
and twelve annas. - Right.

491
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:27,027
I couldn't. So what?

492
00:46:27,107 --> 00:46:29,089
That's why I say,
stay away from women!

493
00:46:29,169 --> 00:46:32,990
Don't repair their cars.
You can't please them. They are cheats.

494
00:46:33,154 --> 00:46:34,192
Yes, all of them are.

495
00:46:34,272 --> 00:46:36,322
Wrong! Not all girls are cheats!

496
00:46:36,402 --> 00:46:38,962
How do you know that
this girl isn't a cheat?

497
00:46:39,209 --> 00:46:40,463
She will pay us.

498
00:46:40,543 --> 00:46:41,916
Did she say so?
- Yes.

499
00:46:41,996 --> 00:46:43,598
When?
- At 2 O'clock at night.

500
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:45,973
She'll come to pay at 2 a.m.,
and we'll keep waiting!

501
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,535
I mean, she told me that
she would come this morning.

502
00:46:49,615 --> 00:46:51,437
At what time?
- At 10 O'clock.

503
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,236
10 O'clock?
- Around 10-10:30.

504
00:46:53,316 --> 00:46:57,419
Rubbish! I shouldn't have sent you!
You get excited seeing girls!

505
00:46:57,829 --> 00:46:59,601
I get excited?!
- Go and do your work!

506
00:47:00,092 --> 00:47:01,582
Go and do your work.

507
00:47:01,662 --> 00:47:06,719
How often have I told him not
to get excited on seeing girls!

508
00:47:06,799 --> 00:47:08,775
To concentrate on his work!
- And you should play!

509
00:47:08,855 --> 00:47:11,715
No.. I am also doing my work.

510
00:47:20,015 --> 00:47:23,014
Mannu! - What is it?
- Nothing.

511
00:47:24,911 --> 00:47:27,813
Are you angry with me?
- No. Why?

512
00:47:29,484 --> 00:47:33,209
May I ask something?
Did you actually fall on the girl?

513
00:47:33,289 --> 00:47:34,592
I told you I did.

514
00:47:34,672 --> 00:47:37,632
You did? In that case,
the girl is very nice.

515
00:47:37,712 --> 00:47:38,685
How do you know?

516
00:47:38,765 --> 00:47:41,280
Wouldn't she have handed you
over to the police otherwise?

517
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:45,536
How does she look?

518
00:47:45,842 --> 00:47:48,015
Very beautiful!
- Really?

519
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:52,956
Manu. Manu.. how old is she?

520
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,316
60 years!

521
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,204
What! She's old.

522
00:47:58,498 --> 00:47:59,986
Don't joke. How old is she?

523
00:48:00,066 --> 00:48:02,274
Damn! She must be
around 20-22 years.

524
00:48:02,354 --> 00:48:04,881
20-22 years! Very good!

525
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:08,556
Hey! What are you doing?
- Nothing. Introduce me to her.

526
00:48:09,664 --> 00:48:13,648
In front of brother, you scold me!
And now, ask me about girls!

527
00:48:13,728 --> 00:48:17,914
I'm dead! Help me, sir!

528
00:48:17,994 --> 00:48:19,721
Help!

529
00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:21,527
Hey, why are you hitting him?

530
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,988
I asked him to paint my car black
but he painted my face instead.

531
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,681
I'll hit him!

532
00:48:25,761 --> 00:48:27,538
Stop it, you fool!

533
00:48:50,504 --> 00:48:54,602
You wanted to fight with me.
Get up. Fight.

534
00:49:00,346 --> 00:49:01,701
Brother!

535
00:49:02,082 --> 00:49:04,002
You act smart with children, huh?!

536
00:49:04,082 --> 00:49:06,862
Mojha accidentally
sprayed paint over his face.

537
00:49:06,942 --> 00:49:09,408
He beat him so badly that the
poor chap began to see stars!

538
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,144
I thrashed him...
- You can't thrash him, you musician!

539
00:49:12,224 --> 00:49:15,581
But you! You eat 50 'rotis',
yet lack the strength!

540
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,650
Brother, I did try.
But he is strong.

541
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:21,221
Why don't you show your might?
Come on.

542
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:24,530
Brother, knock him out!

543
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,467
Come on!
- Really?

544
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:31,212
Brother, just one powerful punch
on the right side.

545
00:49:31,292 --> 00:49:32,380
Come on.

546
00:49:33,374 --> 00:49:36,271
Very good!
Upper cut!

547
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:40,751
Very good!

548
00:49:46,822 --> 00:49:48,509
Do you see stars already?!

549
00:49:54,495 --> 00:49:56,766
Now I will make you see stars!

550
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,470
Ask him how many stars
he can see!

551
00:50:19,939 --> 00:50:21,988
Ask him how many stars
he can see!

552
00:50:22,068 --> 00:50:30,837
1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. 6.. 7.. 8.. 9..
- 10!

553
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:32,715
Send him to the hospital.
- The hospital?

554
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:33,701
Yes!

555
00:50:34,289 --> 00:50:39,063
Heave ho! Heave ho!

556
00:50:39,143 --> 00:50:42,911
Heave ho! Heave ho!

557
00:50:42,991 --> 00:50:44,710
Heave ho! Heave ho!

558
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:48,160
Ready?
- One! - Two! - Three!

559
00:51:05,223 --> 00:51:09,599
It's 10:30. He said she'd
bring the money at 10:30.

560
00:51:09,841 --> 00:51:11,347
My foot, she'll bring!

561
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,970
There's dirt in the carburetor
and the brakes aren't proper too.

562
00:51:34,576 --> 00:51:36,822
Pay your previous dues first.
Only then will I do the next job.

563
00:51:36,902 --> 00:51:38,893
Previous dues?
- Yes. Five rupees and twelve annas.

564
00:51:38,973 --> 00:51:41,268
But I have come here
for the first time.

565
00:51:41,604 --> 00:51:43,196
Really?
- Yes.

566
00:51:43,276 --> 00:51:45,056
Manu! Jaggu!
- Coming!

567
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:48,074
Look, you can fool Mannu
but I'm very smart.

568
00:51:48,154 --> 00:51:50,302
Who's Mannu?
I don't know any Mannu.

569
00:51:50,382 --> 00:51:52,052
So you don't even know Mannu?
- No.

570
00:51:52,132 --> 00:51:55,507
He had repaired your car and was
at your place at 2 last night.

571
00:51:55,587 --> 00:51:56,909
Brother!
- Shut up!

572
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:59,511
He came to my place at 2 a.m.
What do you think I am?

573
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:01,884
What do you think we are?
Do you expect us to work free for you?

574
00:52:01,964 --> 00:52:03,294
Pay up or I'll call the police!

575
00:52:03,374 --> 00:52:05,483
Brother!
- Quiet you fool.

576
00:52:05,563 --> 00:52:06,819
Will you pay five rupees
and twelve annas?

577
00:52:06,899 --> 00:52:09,410
This is some compulsion!
- What! Didn't he work for it?

578
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,626
How much was it?
- Five rupees and twelve annas.

579
00:52:11,706 --> 00:52:13,804
That's what I'm asking for.
- But, brother...

580
00:52:14,402 --> 00:52:15,897
Five rupees and twelve annas.

581
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:18,309
Here, take this.

582
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:22,310
Return four annas.
And here is your receipt. Keep this.

583
00:52:22,757 --> 00:52:25,247
What a problem!
Return me four annas.

584
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,953
Hello.
- Hello. Mohan Brother's motor garage.

585
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,978
Yes?
- Is it Manmohan?

586
00:52:33,058 --> 00:52:34,554
No. I'm his older brother.

587
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:37,935
Could you please call Manmohan?

588
00:52:39,164 --> 00:52:43,123
There's a girl for you.
I'm his older brother. He's busy.

589
00:52:43,298 --> 00:52:45,942
I am calling from
Mr. Kishanchand's bungalow.

590
00:52:46,022 --> 00:52:47,893
Manmohan had repaired
my car earlier also.

591
00:52:47,973 --> 00:52:49,991
When?
- Day before yesterday night.

592
00:52:50,071 --> 00:52:52,843
At 2 a.m.?
- Yes. It's broken down again.

593
00:52:52,923 --> 00:52:54,806
So, you had to pay five rupees
and twelve annas?

594
00:52:54,886 --> 00:52:55,937
That's right.

595
00:52:56,017 --> 00:52:58,656
Damn! I charged some
other girl for it. This is...

596
00:52:58,736 --> 00:53:02,054
I'm sorry. I wasn't talking to you.
What work do you have?

597
00:53:02,134 --> 00:53:05,211
My car has broken down again.
- Fine. I'll send somebody.

598
00:53:10,095 --> 00:53:12,985
Are you convinced now that I've
come here for the first time?

599
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:17,776
I'm extremely sorry. Please sit.
Your car will be repaired.

600
00:53:17,856 --> 00:53:19,662
Here.
- Thank you.

601
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:29,401
Why didn't you tell me?!
- You never gave me a chance!

602
00:53:29,481 --> 00:53:32,814
It wasn't the same girl
but her bag looked so similar.

603
00:53:32,894 --> 00:53:35,407
That's where even I went wrong.
Well, never mind.

604
00:53:35,487 --> 00:53:38,844
Go to Peddar Road and repair
Kishanchand's girl's car.

605
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:39,891
Girl!

606
00:53:39,971 --> 00:53:42,414
He can't collect the money,
so it's no use sending him!

607
00:53:42,494 --> 00:53:48,194
I never visit a girl's house but
since you order me, I'll go.

608
00:53:48,702 --> 00:53:49,844
Mojha!

609
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,903
Listen.

610
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:56,042
Clean the carburetor of her car.
Repair her brakes too.

611
00:53:56,122 --> 00:53:58,831
Repair everything.
But don't charge her.

612
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:01,883
Why?
- I messed up. And insulted her.

613
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:33,444
The engine is fine.
I wonder what's wrong.

614
00:54:33,524 --> 00:54:37,641
I'd repaired it this morning.
I think there's a problem here.

615
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:39,846
I wonder what's wrong.

616
00:54:41,564 --> 00:54:43,954
Who are you?
- Why have you come here?

617
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:46,597
Someone had called for me.
- Who had?

618
00:54:46,677 --> 00:54:49,850
I don't know.
Perhaps it was one of you.

619
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,962
Sheila..
- I don't know who he is!

620
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,988
Mister, you've come
to the wrong house.

621
00:54:56,068 --> 00:55:00,266
How can that be? This was the
address given over the phone.

622
00:55:03,351 --> 00:55:06,477
Are you from the garage?
- That's right.

623
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,751
But the one who had
repaired my car..

624
00:55:10,831 --> 00:55:12,277
..is my younger brother.

625
00:55:14,222 --> 00:55:16,201
Why didn't he come?
- What could he have done?

626
00:55:16,281 --> 00:55:18,857
He's only a mechanic.
I am an automobile engineer.

627
00:55:18,937 --> 00:55:22,514
Well, Mr. Engineer, how long
will you take to repair the car?

628
00:55:22,594 --> 00:55:24,419
I'll have to look at it first.

629
00:55:24,499 --> 00:55:25,563
Go ahead.

630
00:55:26,149 --> 00:55:27,617
Renu dear!

631
00:55:27,697 --> 00:55:29,692
Repair the car quickly.
- Very well.

632
00:55:36,657 --> 00:55:37,764
What's wrong?

633
00:55:37,844 --> 00:55:40,511
If you would step aside,
I'd be able to work better.

634
00:55:41,596 --> 00:55:42,738
Go ahead.

635
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:48,314
Please hurry up!

636
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,522
Hey, don't!
There's nothing wrong with it.

637
00:55:53,003 --> 00:55:54,750
Then, there must be
a problem with the plug.

638
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,324
The plug is fine. The battery is charged.
I've checked everything.

639
00:55:59,609 --> 00:56:01,599
There may be a problem beneath.
- Beneath?

640
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:03,441
Yes. Take a look.

641
00:56:03,521 --> 00:56:04,602
Okay.

642
00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:09,632
Why are you staring at me?
- It's nothing.

643
00:56:09,712 --> 00:56:11,609
There's a black mark on the face.

644
00:56:11,689 --> 00:56:12,870
Black mark?

645
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,348
Wipe it off.
- Me?

646
00:56:17,428 --> 00:56:18,965
Yes, wipe it off.

647
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,650
Hey! Why are you so nervous?

648
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:26,221
I... I... I'm not nervous.

649
00:56:27,423 --> 00:56:28,885
Please get me a glass of water.

650
00:56:28,965 --> 00:56:32,731
Water? Fine, I'll get it.
But at least go down and check.

651
00:56:32,811 --> 00:56:34,962
I'll go right now.
- Quickly.

652
00:56:38,753 --> 00:56:42,312
Hello. Mohan Brother's motor garage.
- Yes.

653
00:56:42,392 --> 00:56:45,928
Whom have you sent?! He's still
not been able to repair the car.

654
00:56:46,008 --> 00:56:47,383
He's had 10 glasses of water!

655
00:56:47,565 --> 00:56:50,120
What!
- Yes! Please send Manmohan.

656
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,356
All right. I'll send somebody else.
Don't worry.

657
00:56:52,436 --> 00:56:53,376
Thanks.

658
00:56:54,985 --> 00:56:57,595
Mannu... come here.
- Yes.

659
00:56:57,675 --> 00:56:59,396
Jaggu can't repair the car.
So you go.

660
00:56:59,476 --> 00:57:00,883
No. I have work to do.

661
00:57:00,963 --> 00:57:04,530
It's beyond him.
He's had 10 glasses of water already.

662
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:06,837
10 glasses of water!
- Yes. Go there.

663
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:08,384
I'm taking the car.
- Okay.

664
00:57:25,126 --> 00:57:27,701
Hasn't the car got repaired yet?
- No, it hasn't.

665
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:29,137
Is that car yours?

666
00:57:29,217 --> 00:57:31,215
That one? It's ours.

667
00:57:31,717 --> 00:57:33,030
It looks very strange.

668
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:36,366
Strange? It's a racing car!
A 1921 model.

669
00:57:36,446 --> 00:57:38,607
May I take a look at it?
- Sure!

670
00:57:38,843 --> 00:57:41,274
Excuse me. My elder brother had
come from the garage. Where's he?

671
00:57:41,354 --> 00:57:43,486
He's beneath.
- Beneath?

672
00:57:44,388 --> 00:57:47,617
Brother Jaggu!
Hey, what's the matter?

673
00:57:47,907 --> 00:57:51,063
I am stuck! Please get me out.

674
00:57:56,712 --> 00:57:57,955
Has the girl gone?
- Yes, she has.

675
00:57:58,035 --> 00:58:01,227
But how did you land there?
- Don't ask! She pushed me in.

676
00:58:01,307 --> 00:58:03,542
How?
- I'll tell you later.

677
00:58:03,622 --> 00:58:05,440
Have you got the car?
- Yes, I have.

678
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,237
I'm leaving.

679
00:58:07,575 --> 00:58:11,140
And listen.. you only recover five rupees
and twelve annas. I'm going!

680
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,751
Brother Jaggu!
- I'm going!

681
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:27,463
Good God! What an escape!

682
00:58:27,543 --> 00:58:31,466
"I am fortunate for having
being able to escape."

683
00:58:31,662 --> 00:58:34,931
"I am fortunate for having
being able to escape."

684
00:58:38,383 --> 00:58:40,476
Hey! Where are you taking me?

685
00:58:40,995 --> 00:58:42,895
Who spoke? There's no one here.

686
00:58:42,975 --> 00:58:44,973
Where are you taking me away?

687
00:58:45,285 --> 00:58:48,278
You!
- Look ahead! There could be an accident!

688
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:53,365
What's happening?!

689
00:59:01,301 --> 00:59:02,691
Listen!

690
00:59:07,104 --> 00:59:09,299
Excuse me!

691
00:59:25,106 --> 00:59:27,604
Excuse me! Please wait!

692
00:59:30,177 --> 00:59:33,476
Please listen to me!
Please wait!

693
00:59:44,685 --> 00:59:47,847
I'm tired. I can't run anymore.

694
00:59:47,927 --> 00:59:49,758
Fine. Then sit in the car.

695
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:52,978
In the car? But how can
I sit in the car with you?

696
00:59:53,058 --> 00:59:54,571
Why not? Am I a tigress?

697
00:59:54,651 --> 00:59:58,214
Well, I don't know that.
But you surely are something!

698
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:00,577
Come on, just get into the car.

699
01:00:00,657 --> 01:00:01,749
Come.

700
01:00:04,728 --> 01:00:07,052
Where do I have to go now?

701
01:00:07,132 --> 01:00:08,991
Drop me home.
- Your home!

702
01:00:10,297 --> 01:00:12,078
Dear God, what trouble
have You landed me in!

703
01:00:12,158 --> 01:00:15,383
What!
- No! I was talking to myself.

704
01:00:15,463 --> 01:00:16,490
Let's go.

705
01:00:28,476 --> 01:00:31,086
When did you come?
- A while back.

706
01:00:31,365 --> 01:00:33,803
You didn't even inform me.
- I was repairing the car.

707
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:36,244
Is it done?
- Yes. It was an easy job!

708
01:00:37,023 --> 01:00:38,536
Your brother couldn't manage.

709
01:00:38,616 --> 01:00:40,026
He was nervous.
- Why?

710
01:00:40,106 --> 01:00:41,597
He's a bit afraid of girls.

711
01:00:41,677 --> 01:00:47,011
I was worried the whole night.
I kept running everywhere.

712
01:00:47,091 --> 01:00:49,098
At the end of it, I got so tired.

713
01:00:50,266 --> 01:00:52,072
Why has the
police inspector come here?

714
01:00:53,499 --> 01:00:56,933
Because a thief had
entered our house last night.

715
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,490
Have you told them?

716
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:04,415
He didn't steal anything.
He only ate 3 bananas and 2 apples.

717
01:01:05,409 --> 01:01:08,186
I suspect he was a member
of a gang of murderers.

718
01:01:08,266 --> 01:01:09,951
What!
- Yes.

719
01:01:10,031 --> 01:01:14,084
A famous jeweler named Lalchand
was murdered nearby last night.

720
01:01:14,164 --> 01:01:15,659
We found his
dead body on the road.

721
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:18,201
Before we could get there,
the rogue escaped.

722
01:01:18,281 --> 01:01:21,357
It's possible, one of the gang
members had entered your house.

723
01:01:21,437 --> 01:01:25,886
Good God! In that case,
search the place well.

724
01:01:25,966 --> 01:01:27,864
Because the hoodlum
has seen my house.

725
01:01:27,944 --> 01:01:32,064
Don't worry. It's a murder case.
I'll take special care.

726
01:01:32,144 --> 01:01:34,171
Thank you very much.

727
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:37,674
In the meantime, I'll go and
keep the jewelry in the bank.

728
01:01:37,754 --> 01:01:40,277
Is the car all right?
- Yes, daddy.

729
01:01:40,357 --> 01:01:43,032
Wait. Let me first
interrogate your driver.

730
01:01:43,112 --> 01:01:47,398
But you've held the driver and
my other servants in custody.

731
01:01:47,478 --> 01:01:48,991
Then who's he?

732
01:01:49,389 --> 01:01:50,687
Who are you?
- Well, I am...

733
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:53,094
He is the mechanic.
He had come to repair the car.

734
01:01:53,174 --> 01:01:54,170
Indeed.

735
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:56,127
Have you come here before?

736
01:01:57,286 --> 01:01:58,670
Never.

737
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,600
I'll question your servants at home.

738
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:06,272
Investigate well.
Inspector, the hoodlum must be caught.

739
01:02:06,487 --> 01:02:09,206
Renu, who will drive the car?
- I will.

740
01:02:09,286 --> 01:02:14,442
I have the jewelry with me.
What if the car breaks down again?

741
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,494
Let's take him along.
- Yes, I'll come.

742
01:02:16,574 --> 01:02:18,371
Come on.
- Let's go.

743
01:02:35,779 --> 01:02:37,713
Your car doesn't
knock now, does it?

744
01:02:37,793 --> 01:02:39,601
No.
- How can it?

745
01:02:39,681 --> 01:02:43,740
My adept hands, and fail?
No company has made such a car!

746
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:46,743
Race... Faster!
Accelerate some more!

747
01:02:46,823 --> 01:02:49,884
Faster, indeed!
Suppose there's an accident, then?

748
01:02:49,964 --> 01:02:52,727
Since the time the thief entered
our house, I've been jittery.

749
01:02:52,807 --> 01:02:55,730
Did a thief actually get in?
- Am I lying then!

750
01:02:56,045 --> 01:02:58,852
What did he steal?
- That's most surprising.

751
01:02:58,932 --> 01:03:00,391
He didn't steal a thing.

752
01:03:00,471 --> 01:03:04,794
How could he? He didn't come to steal.
He wanted to take Rs.5...

753
01:03:05,763 --> 01:03:07,353
What happened, son?
- What's wrong?

754
01:03:07,433 --> 01:03:09,558
You were talking about Rs.5?
- Nothing.

755
01:03:09,638 --> 01:03:13,632
I think he was a
blessed saint, not a thief.

756
01:03:13,712 --> 01:03:19,057
No wonder he ate 3 bananas
and 2 apples... 5 fruits in all.

757
01:03:19,137 --> 01:03:20,379
What do you think?

758
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:23,192
I think he is crazy.

759
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,137
What's happened to you now?

760
01:03:25,217 --> 01:03:28,218
Nothing, daddy. My foot slipped.

761
01:03:28,298 --> 01:03:33,223
Be careful, child. Let me keep
the jewelry safely in the bank.

762
01:03:33,303 --> 01:03:35,567
What a pain!
She wants to drive, indeed!

763
01:03:56,706 --> 01:03:59,294
Why did you talk about the thief
in front of daddy?

764
01:03:59,829 --> 01:04:03,066
You were about to say everything.
You are really mad!

765
01:04:03,957 --> 01:04:07,917
You haven't seen madness yet.
You must meet my brothers first.

766
01:04:08,185 --> 01:04:10,902
I pale out in comparison!

767
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:13,830
The one who came this morning
and had 10 glasses of water...

768
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:16,811
He is my second brother,
Jaggu brother.

769
01:04:17,069 --> 01:04:20,405
An electrical engineer.
But he's ignorant about electrical works.

770
01:04:22,355 --> 01:04:26,812
He does discuss girls but gets
jittery when he faces them!

771
01:04:33,337 --> 01:04:34,617
And what about you?

772
01:04:35,006 --> 01:04:38,288
Me? I'm the opposite.

773
01:04:38,368 --> 01:04:39,335
What?

774
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:41,275
Girls are afraid of me.

775
01:04:44,459 --> 01:04:47,639
You know the state
you were in last night!

776
01:04:48,578 --> 01:04:50,842
Don't laugh. You're too much!

777
01:04:51,161 --> 01:04:54,371
Should you have done that just to collect
five rupees twelve annas?

778
01:04:54,451 --> 01:04:55,850
I had no choice.

779
01:04:55,930 --> 01:05:00,101
Had I not come, my eldest brother
would have thrashed me badly.

780
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:03,916
And specially, bills of girls!
No way!

781
01:05:04,394 --> 01:05:06,727
Why? What wrong have girls done?

782
01:05:06,807 --> 01:05:10,660
I don't know.
But yes, he does hate them.

783
01:05:11,606 --> 01:05:15,498
He even hates their pictures.

784
01:05:16,068 --> 01:05:19,963
He instructs us not to talk to them,
not to repair their cars.

785
01:05:20,043 --> 01:05:22,252
And was he the one
who sent you to collect..

786
01:05:22,332 --> 01:05:24,105
..five rupees twelve annas at 2 a. M?

787
01:05:24,185 --> 01:05:25,359
Obviously.

788
01:05:26,284 --> 01:05:27,672
Hey! Where are you going?

789
01:05:28,126 --> 01:05:30,816
To drop you to your garage.
- Please don't that!

790
01:05:30,896 --> 01:05:34,170
If my elder brother sees me
with you, he'll kill me.

791
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:37,154
Give me the money,
I'll get off here.

792
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:40,875
Mannu, I'll pay the money
only to him.

793
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,693
And I will also see
how much he hates girls.

794
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:47,096
That's your problem.
But please let me get off here.

795
01:05:47,525 --> 01:05:50,099
Please stop the car!
Look...

796
01:05:53,251 --> 01:05:54,701
All right. Drive on.

797
01:05:55,611 --> 01:05:57,334
What happened?
- Nothing.

798
01:05:57,414 --> 01:06:01,327
It's 12 O'clock. He won't be
in the garage now. Drive on.

799
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:06,258
That's it.

800
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:11,836
Thank you.

801
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,129
Done?
- Yes.

802
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:54,627
"I was there, and so was she.
She was there, and so was l."

803
01:06:55,308 --> 01:06:56,271
"I was there, and so was she."

804
01:06:56,351 --> 01:06:59,311
"The ambience too were lovely;
you know what I mean."

805
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:03,030
"Reached a place I never meant to go;
you know what I mean."

806
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:07,161
"It means I am in love!"

807
01:07:07,427 --> 01:07:08,421
"I was there, and so was she."

808
01:07:08,501 --> 01:07:10,875
"The ambience too were lovely;
you know what I mean."

809
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:14,886
"Reached a place I never meant to go;
you know what I mean."

810
01:07:15,124 --> 01:07:19,157
"It means I am in love!"

811
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:45,313
"How I got lost in her words."

812
01:07:45,393 --> 01:07:48,798
"I'll tell you about it
but let me catch my breath."

813
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:53,216
"How she got lost in my words."

814
01:07:53,296 --> 01:07:56,904
"I'll tell you about it
but let me catch my breath."

815
01:07:57,341 --> 01:08:01,132
"Messages aplenty
were conveyed through the eyes."

816
01:08:01,212 --> 01:08:05,219
"I'll tell you about it
but let me catch my breath."

817
01:08:07,354 --> 01:08:08,316
"I was there, and so was she."

818
01:08:08,396 --> 01:08:11,289
"The ambience too were lovely;
you know what I mean."

819
01:08:11,369 --> 01:08:14,803
"Reached a place I never meant to go;
you know what I mean."

820
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:18,745
"It means I am in love!"

821
01:08:18,825 --> 01:08:23,095
"Mannu, love has struck you
but what about me now?"

822
01:08:23,175 --> 01:08:27,074
"Mannu, love has struck you
but what about me now?"

823
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:45,249
"Two eyes fluttered so fast.."

824
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:48,965
"..when she turned behind
to look at me."

825
01:08:49,303 --> 01:08:52,660
"As though she was telling me,
'Listen to me, young lad.'

826
01:08:53,291 --> 01:08:56,275
"When I turned behind
to look at her."

827
01:08:57,302 --> 01:09:01,200
"Two hearts then began
to beat so fast.."

828
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,972
"..when both of us turned behind
to look at each other."

829
01:09:07,388 --> 01:09:08,361
"I was there, and so was she."

830
01:09:08,441 --> 01:09:10,642
"The ambience too were lovely;
you know what I mean."

831
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:14,890
"Reached a place I never meant to go;
you know what I mean."

832
01:09:15,202 --> 01:09:18,543
"It means I am in love!"

833
01:09:18,623 --> 01:09:23,006
"Mannu, love has struck you
but what about me now?"

834
01:09:23,086 --> 01:09:26,959
"Mannu, love has struck you
but what about me now?"

835
01:09:41,748 --> 01:09:45,672
"Just a little."

836
01:09:45,752 --> 01:09:49,015
"Just a little slowly she pulled."

837
01:09:49,722 --> 01:09:55,894
"Then her sari,
just a little slowly I pulled."

838
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:03,901
"From sheer nervousness then,
Our hands we pulled."

839
01:10:07,784 --> 01:10:08,762
"I was there, and so was she."

840
01:10:08,842 --> 01:10:11,322
"The ambience too were lovely;
you know what I mean."

841
01:10:11,789 --> 01:10:15,248
"Reached a place I never meant to go;
you know what I mean."

842
01:10:15,602 --> 01:10:19,390
"It means I am in love!"

843
01:10:25,653 --> 01:10:27,123
Is it true?

844
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:33,571
All of it is a lie!

845
01:10:36,109 --> 01:10:40,485
When Renu gets married,
you'll long to eat such food.

846
01:10:40,565 --> 01:10:42,374
You're absolutely right.

847
01:10:42,682 --> 01:10:46,072
My dear, have you
heard of King Hardayal?

848
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:52,111
Why?
- He is coming home tomorrow.

849
01:10:52,191 --> 01:10:55,388
Why?
- To meet you.

850
01:10:56,088 --> 01:10:58,476
His younger brother,
Prince Prakashchand..

851
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:00,597
..will be returning
to India in some days.

852
01:11:00,949 --> 01:11:02,166
He may be!

853
01:11:02,246 --> 01:11:05,624
Hardayal says that
the boy is brilliant.

854
01:11:05,704 --> 01:11:09,105
He looks good,
and is good-natured too.

855
01:11:09,185 --> 01:11:10,402
Maybe.

856
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:13,783
I think he's worthy of you
in every respect.

857
01:11:14,112 --> 01:11:18,410
What? So, were you
discussing my marriage?

858
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:21,813
Obviously! Uncle wants you
to become a princess.

859
01:11:23,798 --> 01:11:25,327
So, have you fixed the marriage?

860
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:29,247
No, my child. How can I fix it
without your consent?

861
01:11:29,766 --> 01:11:32,195
Meet Prakash first.

862
01:11:32,275 --> 01:11:34,737
If you like him,
then give your consent.

863
01:11:34,817 --> 01:11:37,006
But what's the hurry, father?

864
01:11:37,086 --> 01:11:41,435
If your mother were alive,
she'd have got you married 4 years ago!

865
01:11:42,174 --> 01:11:44,531
Father, I will not
marry a prince.

866
01:11:44,868 --> 01:11:46,105
Meet him first.

867
01:11:46,185 --> 01:11:49,101
I'm sure he will have all
the qualities that I dislike.

868
01:11:49,181 --> 01:11:50,648
He may not have them either.

869
01:11:50,914 --> 01:11:53,238
All rich people has false pride.

870
01:11:53,318 --> 01:11:55,877
But you don't.
- Well said!

871
01:11:55,957 --> 01:11:59,656
Explain to your friend.
I'll go and have a digestive pill.

872
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:10,657
You must be thrilled,
hearing about the prince?

873
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:23,008
You look as though
you're really angry.

874
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:24,072
I am!

875
01:12:24,152 --> 01:12:26,138
I understand.
- My foot, you do!

876
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:27,984
"Uncle wants you
to become a princess!"

877
01:12:28,562 --> 01:12:33,183
Fine. I'll tell uncle
that a prince won't do.

878
01:12:33,338 --> 01:12:35,191
He should get you married
to a king instead!

879
01:12:35,271 --> 01:12:38,117
You talk of marriage all the time!
Why are you after me?!

880
01:12:38,197 --> 01:12:40,827
Why don't you
get married instead?!

881
01:12:40,907 --> 01:12:46,203
O' God! I always keep dreaming
about it! When I'll get married?

882
01:12:47,843 --> 01:12:50,503
Shall I tell you?
Marry the prince.

883
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:53,066
Nonsense! Even I don't like him.

884
01:12:53,438 --> 01:12:57,510
Whom would you like?
- I like someone round.

885
01:12:58,818 --> 01:13:00,513
Round?
- It'll be nice, won't it?

886
01:13:00,593 --> 01:13:04,210
And he should be
a little dim-witted too.

887
01:13:05,485 --> 01:13:06,224
Why?

888
01:13:06,304 --> 01:13:09,862
Because nowadays the shrewd boys
will not be in your control.

889
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:15,034
I want a hen-pecked husband.

890
01:13:15,114 --> 01:13:15,951
Very good.

891
01:13:16,332 --> 01:13:18,976
I think you already have
some dim-witted boy in mind?

892
01:13:19,056 --> 01:13:21,735
There are many.
In fact, it's getting difficult to select.

893
01:13:23,277 --> 01:13:24,742
It's your turn now.

894
01:13:25,075 --> 01:13:26,242
Shall I tell you?

895
01:13:27,851 --> 01:13:29,218
Not now.

896
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:45,954
Who is disturbing me?
Excuse me, I'll just come!

897
01:13:57,613 --> 01:13:58,798
Good morning, ma'am.

898
01:14:01,992 --> 01:14:04,782
Where is everyone?
- It's the day off. No work today.

899
01:14:07,241 --> 01:14:09,783
Where is Mannu?
- All of them are sleeping.

900
01:14:10,355 --> 01:14:13,321
They are still sleeping?!
- They will wake up at 12.

901
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,020
Just shut up!
What impertinence is this!

902
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:17,249
I'm sorry, ma'am.

903
01:14:17,329 --> 01:14:18,817
I have important work with Mannu.

904
01:14:18,897 --> 01:14:22,799
Go upstairs and take a left.
Mr. Mannu is sleeping there.

905
01:14:30,136 --> 01:14:31,978
Oh I'm sorry! Come on!

906
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:53,626
Hey!

907
01:15:02,732 --> 01:15:03,718
Hey!

908
01:15:06,226 --> 01:15:07,272
Wake up.

909
01:15:17,489 --> 01:15:19,676
Did anybody see you?
How did you reach here?

910
01:15:20,671 --> 01:15:22,036
Just the way you reached my house.

911
01:15:22,116 --> 01:15:24,544
I got there by mistake.
- Even I got here by mistake.

912
01:15:24,624 --> 01:15:27,862
If my brothers see you,
I'll be in deep trouble!

913
01:15:28,716 --> 01:15:30,389
Are they also yet sleeping?!

914
01:15:30,469 --> 01:15:32,664
Yes. Now's the chance,
so please leave!

915
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,600
I came to pay
five rupees twelve annas.

916
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,205
Forget the charges! Please go!

917
01:15:38,497 --> 01:15:43,373
Why? When you'd come to my place,
you had created such a racket!

918
01:15:43,712 --> 01:15:46,627
Today I will surely pay
five rupees twelve annas.

919
01:15:53,242 --> 01:15:54,687
I'll be dead!

920
01:15:56,485 --> 01:15:59,807
Help! Help!!

921
01:16:00,645 --> 01:16:03,750
Help me, Mannu!

922
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:08,030
What happened?
- Something disastrous!

923
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:12,173
A lad... I mean, a lass
barged into my room!

924
01:16:12,253 --> 01:16:14,110
Which lass?
- The petrol lass.

925
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:16,976
The petrol lass?
- Yes. She has barged into my room.

926
01:16:32,482 --> 01:16:33,847
Excuse me.

927
01:16:35,305 --> 01:16:37,853
I'll take the tea. You may leave.

928
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:55,813
Tea.

929
01:17:06,916 --> 01:17:10,301
I knew you would
surely come someday.

930
01:17:14,495 --> 01:17:17,091
I've been waiting for you
since so long.

931
01:17:19,717 --> 01:17:22,041
Are you asleep or awake?

932
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:26,971
Tea.

933
01:17:28,063 --> 01:17:29,700
What's the time?

934
01:17:30,734 --> 01:17:31,789
9 O'clock.

935
01:17:31,869 --> 01:17:34,908
You woke me very early.
Break my knuckles.

936
01:17:36,162 --> 01:17:38,540
Come on!

937
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:46,676
You aren't doing it right!
Never mind.

938
01:17:46,756 --> 01:17:49,405
Massage my back.
- No!

939
01:17:49,805 --> 01:17:51,124
Why not?

940
01:17:56,703 --> 01:18:00,093
Jaggu! Mannu! Mojha!

941
01:18:00,173 --> 01:18:04,165
Why are you shouting?
I had come to pay the bill.

942
01:18:04,245 --> 01:18:06,901
Which bill?
- For repairing my car.

943
01:18:06,981 --> 01:18:09,807
Who are you?
- I am Renu.

944
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:13,839
Renu? Who's Renu?
Where are you from?

945
01:18:13,919 --> 01:18:16,952
Jaggu, there's a girl in my room!

946
01:18:17,341 --> 01:18:19,870
Run! Go to sleep!

947
01:18:20,616 --> 01:18:22,411
Don't move.
- I won't.

948
01:18:23,243 --> 01:18:25,654
Please move away. Jaggu!

949
01:18:33,638 --> 01:18:37,362
Mannu! Get up! There is a big blunder!
- What happened?

950
01:18:37,442 --> 01:18:38,794
There's someone
named Renu in my room.

951
01:18:38,874 --> 01:18:41,891
Renu is a girl!
- A girl!

952
01:18:41,971 --> 01:18:43,404
I don't know her.
- Me neither.

953
01:18:43,484 --> 01:18:45,796
But how did
a girl get into my room?

954
01:18:45,876 --> 01:18:48,209
Which girl?
- Who's the girl?

955
01:18:48,289 --> 01:18:50,411
She's here to pay her bill.
But how did she get into my room?

956
01:18:50,491 --> 01:18:53,848
How did she get there?
- Mannu, you know everything!

957
01:18:53,928 --> 01:18:56,394
Do you know her?
- No! Yes, I do.

958
01:18:56,474 --> 01:18:59,354
She owes us five rupees twelve annas.
- Oh, so you've called her here?

959
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:01,422
Why should I?
She must have come on her own.

960
01:19:01,502 --> 01:19:04,427
How can such a big girl
come here uninvited?!

961
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:05,397
Exactly.

962
01:19:06,741 --> 01:19:09,101
All of you seem troubled
because I'm here.

963
01:19:09,181 --> 01:19:11,911
No. But you could have
paid the bill at the office.

964
01:19:11,991 --> 01:19:14,656
I was sleeping and you came
upstairs. It's a holiday today.

965
01:19:14,736 --> 01:19:16,766
Please listen to me.
- Sorry.

966
01:19:17,406 --> 01:19:20,874
I had gone to your office.
But even there, a boy was dancing.

967
01:19:20,954 --> 01:19:22,370
Even there?

968
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:25,890
She went to pay her bill at
the office and Mojha was dancing!

969
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:27,775
What audacity!
Bring my boxing gloves.

970
01:19:27,855 --> 01:19:28,839
Forget it.
- How can I?

971
01:19:28,919 --> 01:19:33,027
Excuse me. I have some work.
May I take Mannu along?

972
01:19:33,328 --> 01:19:37,636
I don't like my brothers
going out with girls...

973
01:19:37,716 --> 01:19:40,099
Whose picture is this?
- I found it in his room.

974
01:19:40,179 --> 01:19:42,241
A girl!
- A girl's picture!

975
01:19:42,321 --> 01:19:44,707
Show me!
- Let me see!

976
01:19:44,787 --> 01:19:48,742
Give it here. It will tear.

977
01:19:48,822 --> 01:19:50,651
But how did a girl's picture
reach my room?

978
01:19:50,731 --> 01:19:53,474
It was on your bed.
- Fine. But on my bed?!

979
01:19:53,554 --> 01:19:57,440
It was under your pillow.
- I know. But how?

980
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,054
Shall I burn it with Mobil Oil?

981
01:19:59,134 --> 01:20:01,153
There's no need. I want to...

982
01:20:01,465 --> 01:20:05,694
Take him along. I'll find out how
a girl's bed reached my pillow!

983
01:20:05,774 --> 01:20:08,461
I mean, how a girl's picture was
found on my bed. I'll find out.

984
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:10,270
What's brother saying?

985
01:20:12,908 --> 01:20:15,087
Mannu.. let's go.

986
01:20:15,309 --> 01:20:16,358
Okay.

987
01:20:17,907 --> 01:20:21,124
Everybody's gone?
I'll go to sleep!

988
01:20:35,092 --> 01:20:36,570
Come out.

989
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:43,678
Madam, where have you brought me?

990
01:20:43,963 --> 01:20:45,979
Stop being so formal.
- Sorry.

991
01:20:46,697 --> 01:20:48,103
Hold the basket.

992
01:20:49,948 --> 01:20:51,107
How is the place?

993
01:20:52,491 --> 01:20:53,615
It's beautiful!

994
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,325
Madam, you...
- You're being formal again.

995
01:21:05,879 --> 01:21:08,050
You mentioned that
you had some work?

996
01:21:08,388 --> 01:21:11,648
I don't spot any car here.
So what will I repair?

997
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:15,452
Can't there be any work
other than repairing cars?

998
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:19,152
What else can there be?
- There can be many other jobs.

999
01:21:19,232 --> 01:21:20,779
For instance?
- Will you be able to do it?

1000
01:21:20,859 --> 01:21:22,136
I can do anything.

1001
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:24,365
Think about it.
- I have.

1002
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:26,936
Suppose you can't?
- I'll concede defeat then.

1003
01:21:28,245 --> 01:21:31,658
Let's lay a bet.
- What?

1004
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:37,610
If you lose, you'll have to
carry the basket, the entire day.

1005
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:38,652
Basket?

1006
01:21:39,463 --> 01:21:41,716
Do you accept?
- I do. Tell me the job.

1007
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:43,771
Let me think.
- Okay.

1008
01:21:45,907 --> 01:21:48,069
You see that?

1009
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:49,307
Yes.

1010
01:21:51,729 --> 01:21:53,095
What's it?
- A hen.

1011
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:55,109
Go and catch it.
- The hen?

1012
01:21:55,189 --> 01:21:57,455
Yes.
- That's no big deal!

1013
01:21:58,052 --> 01:21:59,133
Hold this.

1014
01:22:36,445 --> 01:22:39,482
"How's the gentleman feeling?"

1015
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,044
"How do you think I'm feeling?"

1016
01:22:43,476 --> 01:22:46,483
"So zealous you appear."

1017
01:22:47,074 --> 01:22:49,697
"I was swept off my feet
so I slipped."

1018
01:22:50,629 --> 01:22:53,570
"How's the gentleman feeling?"

1019
01:22:54,098 --> 01:22:56,986
"How do you think I'm feeling?"

1020
01:22:57,583 --> 01:23:00,688
"So zealous you appear."

1021
01:23:01,155 --> 01:23:03,965
"I was swept off my feet
so I slipped."

1022
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:32,816
"Soft breeze begins to blow;
your sari flutters to and fro."

1023
01:23:32,896 --> 01:23:39,980
"Let go of it and watch
the white and dark clouds."

1024
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:47,012
"Soft breeze begins to blow;
your sari flutters to and fro."

1025
01:23:47,092 --> 01:23:54,084
"Let go of it and watch
the white and dark clouds."

1026
01:23:54,164 --> 01:24:00,244
"Your eyes convey messages
so conflicting."

1027
01:24:01,472 --> 01:24:04,672
"How's the gentleman feeling?"

1028
01:24:05,035 --> 01:24:07,872
"How do you think I'm feeling?"

1029
01:24:08,581 --> 01:24:11,756
"So zealous you appear."

1030
01:24:12,119 --> 01:24:15,189
"I was swept off my feet
so I slipped."

1031
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:36,758
"Foolish girl, have you wondered
why we ever met."

1032
01:24:36,838 --> 01:24:43,659
"Foolish boy, why does every word
you say make my heart beat fast."

1033
01:24:43,739 --> 01:24:50,985
"Foolish girl, have you wondered
why we ever met."

1034
01:24:51,065 --> 01:24:58,121
"Foolish boy, why does every word
you say make my heart beat fast."

1035
01:24:58,201 --> 01:25:04,305
"Your eyes convey messages
so conflicting."

1036
01:25:05,516 --> 01:25:08,257
"How's the gentleman feeling?"

1037
01:25:09,088 --> 01:25:12,019
"How do you think I'm feeling?"

1038
01:25:12,642 --> 01:25:15,747
"So zealous you appear."

1039
01:25:16,265 --> 01:25:19,042
"I was swept off my feet
so I slipped."

1040
01:25:31,955 --> 01:25:39,062
"Should I spend every single day
with you this way?"

1041
01:25:39,142 --> 01:25:46,105
"I fail to fathom a thing
so how do I tell you anything?"

1042
01:25:46,185 --> 01:25:53,259
"Should I spend every single day
with you this way?"

1043
01:25:53,339 --> 01:26:00,403
"I fail to fathom a thing
so how do I tell you anything?"

1044
01:26:00,483 --> 01:26:06,999
"Your eyes convey messages
so conflicting."

1045
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,642
"How's the lady feeling?"

1046
01:26:11,412 --> 01:26:14,612
"How do you think I'm feeling?"

1047
01:26:14,946 --> 01:26:18,103
"So zealous you appear."

1048
01:26:18,503 --> 01:26:22,070
"I was swept off my feet
so I slipped."

1049
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:25,444
"How are you feeling?"

1050
01:26:25,746 --> 01:26:28,665
"How do you think I'm feeling?"

1051
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,599
"So zealous you appear."

1052
01:26:32,902 --> 01:26:36,448
"I was swept off my feet
so I slipped."

1053
01:26:36,528 --> 01:26:39,330
"How's the gentleman feeling?"

1054
01:26:40,043 --> 01:26:43,210
"How do you think I'm feeling?"

1055
01:26:43,557 --> 01:26:46,757
"So zealous you appear."

1056
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:50,572
"I was swept off my feet
so I slipped."

1057
01:26:56,228 --> 01:26:57,309
I win.

1058
01:26:58,185 --> 01:26:59,834
It was such a lovely day!

1059
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:01,749
Time just flew!

1060
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:05,050
I will always remember this day.

1061
01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:08,973
Let alone this day, I will
always remember this night too.

1062
01:27:10,214 --> 01:27:11,181
Why?

1063
01:27:11,261 --> 01:27:15,939
Only I know how much brother is
going to box me, once I get home.

1064
01:27:16,188 --> 01:27:18,804
Let's go. It's getting late.
- Are you so scared of them?

1065
01:27:18,884 --> 01:27:21,258
No, I'm not!
But I have to be scared.

1066
01:27:21,863 --> 01:27:26,436
Well, they love me very much,
and even I reciprocate that.

1067
01:27:26,516 --> 01:27:31,397
So I'm afraid that I may
do something to upset them.

1068
01:27:32,241 --> 01:27:35,550
Wow! What cool breeze!

1069
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:38,208
Yes. What cool breeze!

1070
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,554
What a beautiful place!

1071
01:27:42,634 --> 01:27:44,467
It's a lovely place!

1072
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:47,354
So let's sit here for a while.

1073
01:27:47,841 --> 01:27:49,741
No! We'll get late!

1074
01:27:49,821 --> 01:27:52,221
No problem.
- You just don't understand.

1075
01:27:53,842 --> 01:27:55,777
It's 7 O'clock.
- Who cares!

1076
01:27:55,857 --> 01:27:58,722
Elder brother will...
I'll be in deep trouble!

1077
01:27:58,989 --> 01:28:02,232
Mannu, you haven't
understood a thing.

1078
01:28:02,891 --> 01:28:05,528
I understand everything!
- What do you understand?

1079
01:28:05,608 --> 01:28:10,143
That girls nowadays are lazy.
Once they sit, they don't get up!

1080
01:28:10,223 --> 01:28:13,333
Please hurry up. Please.

1081
01:28:21,181 --> 01:28:22,716
Mannu.
- Yes?

1082
01:28:25,311 --> 01:28:26,716
Nothing.

1083
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:30,673
Mannu.
- Yes?

1084
01:28:31,667 --> 01:28:35,265
What are you thinking about?
- Nothing. But why?

1085
01:28:37,537 --> 01:28:38,694
It's nothing.

1086
01:28:39,804 --> 01:28:42,272
There's surely something.
Tell me.

1087
01:28:43,007 --> 01:28:44,834
Hey, tell me.

1088
01:28:50,585 --> 01:28:52,071
Shall I?
- Yes.

1089
01:28:58,824 --> 01:29:00,295
Mannu.
- Yes?

1090
01:29:01,841 --> 01:29:03,451
I'm getting married.

1091
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:07,441
Married?

1092
01:29:09,549 --> 01:29:10,922
Married?

1093
01:29:14,036 --> 01:29:18,180
So you're getting married?
With which fool?

1094
01:29:19,873 --> 01:29:23,378
Not with a fool
but with a prince.

1095
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:26,393
With a prince? That's obvious.

1096
01:29:27,819 --> 01:29:31,987
I think... you are a bit jealous.

1097
01:29:32,432 --> 01:29:34,998
Jealous? Why should I be jealous?

1098
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:41,126
Girls do get married. And then,
I am glad you're marrying a prince.

1099
01:29:41,508 --> 01:29:44,163
The wedding will be held with splendor.
There will be feasts.

1100
01:29:44,243 --> 01:29:46,411
And... and...

1101
01:29:47,343 --> 01:29:48,954
And even I'll come.

1102
01:29:50,532 --> 01:29:52,197
You're happy?

1103
01:29:53,278 --> 01:29:55,008
I ought to be happy.

1104
01:29:55,267 --> 01:29:59,720
Of course, we won't be
able to meet this way then.

1105
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,428
We won't have
the freedom to go out.

1106
01:30:02,508 --> 01:30:05,245
Is that all?

1107
01:30:05,966 --> 01:30:07,602
What else can there be?

1108
01:30:09,181 --> 01:30:13,235
I will get married and go away
to another man's house.

1109
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:16,268
Aren't you feeling bad at all?

1110
01:30:16,348 --> 01:30:19,008
Yes... No.

1111
01:30:19,408 --> 01:30:21,946
No?
- No.

1112
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:25,451
Not at all?

1113
01:30:27,526 --> 01:30:28,910
Not at all.

1114
01:30:38,294 --> 01:30:39,450
Renu.

1115
01:30:39,699 --> 01:30:41,504
Renu. Renu.

1116
01:30:42,217 --> 01:30:44,163
Renu. Renu.

1117
01:30:54,595 --> 01:30:58,569
Mr. Kishanchand, if you give
your consent, I'll be at peace.

1118
01:30:58,649 --> 01:31:03,264
You have approached us with the
proposal. So how can I refuse?

1119
01:31:03,513 --> 01:31:07,210
But I must ask Renu once.

1120
01:31:07,881 --> 01:31:11,671
Sure. But I've already approved
of Renu for my younger brother.

1121
01:31:11,751 --> 01:31:14,685
Thank you.
I consider myself fortunate.

1122
01:31:14,765 --> 01:31:15,978
Exactly what I wanted to say.

1123
01:31:16,058 --> 01:31:19,089
We received many proposals
from royal families.

1124
01:31:19,169 --> 01:31:23,415
But all the other girls
paled in comparison with Renu.

1125
01:31:23,977 --> 01:31:26,363
By the way, when will Prakash
be returning from abroad?

1126
01:31:26,443 --> 01:31:30,339
Very soon. God willing, even you
will be as happy to see him..

1127
01:31:30,419 --> 01:31:31,571
..as I was, on seeing Renu.

1128
01:31:31,651 --> 01:31:34,241
Why not? After all, he is
your younger brother.

1129
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:37,856
I'm not praising him
because he is my younger brother.

1130
01:31:38,256 --> 01:31:40,408
But because
he is a brilliant boy.

1131
01:31:40,894 --> 01:31:43,755
Renu, come here.

1132
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:47,623
Meet King Hardayal Singh.

1133
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:49,262
Hello, Renu!

1134
01:31:55,814 --> 01:31:57,122
Do you like the design?

1135
01:31:57,202 --> 01:31:59,879
Why did you bother?

1136
01:31:59,959 --> 01:32:03,376
Does one go empty-handed to fix a
marriage? It's only a small token.

1137
01:32:04,583 --> 01:32:06,622
Take it, dear. You tell her.

1138
01:32:06,702 --> 01:32:11,167
Take it, my dear. If that's what
he wants, how can we refuse him?

1139
01:32:11,773 --> 01:32:12,962
Thank you.

1140
01:32:17,458 --> 01:32:20,506
Father, may I...
- Yes, you may go now.

1141
01:32:20,586 --> 01:32:22,257
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1142
01:32:25,436 --> 01:32:28,030
In spite of being the daughter
of such a wealthy father..

1143
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:31,799
..she is so gentle and coy.
They will make a good pair.

1144
01:32:55,535 --> 01:32:57,909
Can't you make out how changed
Mannu is from how he was at dawn?

1145
01:32:57,989 --> 01:32:59,016
No.
- Take this.

1146
01:32:59,297 --> 01:33:00,979
He's become a bit fat.

1147
01:33:01,059 --> 01:33:04,417
Rubbish! What are you thinking?
- Nothing.

1148
01:33:04,497 --> 01:33:07,952
You'd laugh over dinner daily...
- You'd create a din.

1149
01:33:08,032 --> 01:33:09,633
What's wrong?

1150
01:33:09,713 --> 01:33:12,222
I told you, it's nothing.
- Tell us what happened!

1151
01:33:12,302 --> 01:33:14,675
I told you, it's nothing!
- He says, it's nothing.

1152
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:16,140
He's playing with fire!

1153
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:19,121
Exactly! With fire?
- Yes!

1154
01:33:20,657 --> 01:33:23,196
I'd warned you not to
get involved with rich girls.

1155
01:33:23,276 --> 01:33:24,648
Exactly.
- You shut up!

1156
01:33:24,728 --> 01:33:29,190
They never stand by you. Continue
this way and you'll sulk forever!

1157
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,807
And not eat.
- You eat your food!

1158
01:33:30,887 --> 01:33:33,032
But I disagree.
- About what?

1159
01:33:33,317 --> 01:33:35,138
That every rich girl is...

1160
01:33:39,545 --> 01:33:41,568
Mannu, you still
haven't seen the world.

1161
01:33:41,648 --> 01:33:43,809
Mannu, you still
haven't seen the world.

1162
01:33:43,889 --> 01:33:45,820
Have you?
- No.

1163
01:33:46,674 --> 01:33:49,999
It's for your own good. Women are
the root cause of all troubles.

1164
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:51,665
We should stay away from them!

1165
01:33:51,745 --> 01:33:54,155
Then why do you keep a
woman's picture with you?

1166
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:06,168
I wasn't going to hide about it
from both of you.

1167
01:34:06,968 --> 01:34:09,216
I thought I'd tell you
at an opportune time.

1168
01:34:10,038 --> 01:34:12,276
You asked why I keep that picture.

1169
01:34:12,379 --> 01:34:14,374
It's because I loved that girl.

1170
01:34:14,828 --> 01:34:18,048
She was also
a beautiful and rich girl.

1171
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:21,672
But I was an ordinary man then.

1172
01:34:22,484 --> 01:34:25,847
Therefore, she jilted me
for a man as rich as her.

1173
01:34:27,543 --> 01:34:29,705
The trauma of it still hurts.

1174
01:34:29,785 --> 01:34:33,012
If not for both of you,
I may have taken a drastic step.

1175
01:34:33,092 --> 01:34:35,868
Perhaps even killed myself.

1176
01:34:37,618 --> 01:34:41,874
I only want to say that I don't
want you to get hurt like me.

1177
01:34:42,255 --> 01:34:43,875
You will not be able to bear it.

1178
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:48,287
Eat your dinner.

1179
01:35:16,717 --> 01:35:18,631
"I'm yours."

1180
01:35:20,188 --> 01:35:22,248
"I'm yours."

1181
01:35:22,328 --> 01:35:26,714
"Come and see for yourself."

1182
01:35:26,794 --> 01:35:28,946
"I'm yours."

1183
01:35:29,026 --> 01:35:33,471
"Come and see for yourself."

1184
01:35:33,551 --> 01:35:40,091
"If you're not convinced
then ask my heart."

1185
01:35:40,171 --> 01:35:46,749
"If you're not convinced
then ask my heart."

1186
01:35:46,829 --> 01:35:48,381
"I'm yours."

1187
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:09,361
"When two hearts meet.."

1188
01:36:09,441 --> 01:36:12,273
"..what can the world do, my love?"

1189
01:36:12,353 --> 01:36:16,063
"When two hearts meet.."

1190
01:36:16,143 --> 01:36:18,921
"..the world will burn
with envy, my love."

1191
01:36:19,001 --> 01:36:22,554
"When two hearts meet.."

1192
01:36:22,634 --> 01:36:25,473
"..what can the world do, my love?"

1193
01:36:25,553 --> 01:36:29,127
"When two hearts meet.."

1194
01:36:29,207 --> 01:36:32,013
"..the world will burn
with envy, my love."

1195
01:36:32,511 --> 01:36:39,914
"If you wish,
walk a few steps with me and see."

1196
01:36:40,693 --> 01:36:46,974
"If you're not convinced
then ask my heart."

1197
01:36:47,054 --> 01:36:49,288
"I'm yours."

1198
01:36:49,368 --> 01:36:53,807
"Come and see for yourself."

1199
01:36:53,887 --> 01:36:55,461
"I'm yours."

1200
01:37:11,752 --> 01:37:15,027
"The unbridled joys
that love can bring."

1201
01:37:15,128 --> 01:37:18,461
"Hearing about it
will make you so oblivious."

1202
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:21,762
"The unbridled joys
that love can bring."

1203
01:37:21,842 --> 01:37:24,632
"You will begin to fathom."

1204
01:37:24,712 --> 01:37:28,465
"The unbridled joys
that love can bring."

1205
01:37:28,545 --> 01:37:31,805
"Hearing about it
will make you so oblivious."

1206
01:37:31,885 --> 01:37:35,156
"The unbridled joys
that love can bring."

1207
01:37:35,236 --> 01:37:38,505
"You will begin to fathom."

1208
01:37:38,585 --> 01:37:46,977
"Let your heart be restless
just the way mine is."

1209
01:37:47,057 --> 01:37:53,549
"If you're not convinced
then ask my heart."

1210
01:37:53,629 --> 01:37:55,787
"I'm yours."

1211
01:37:55,867 --> 01:38:00,295
"Come and see for yourself."

1212
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:01,938
"I'm yours."

1213
01:38:21,573 --> 01:38:24,444
"The one who truly loves you.."

1214
01:38:24,524 --> 01:38:28,054
"..cannot be afraid of sorrows."

1215
01:38:28,134 --> 01:38:30,957
"The one who truly loves you.."

1216
01:38:31,037 --> 01:38:34,168
"will never whimper a protest."

1217
01:38:34,248 --> 01:38:37,454
"The one who truly loves you.."

1218
01:38:37,534 --> 01:38:41,086
"..cannot be afraid of sorrows."

1219
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:43,949
"The one who truly loves you.."

1220
01:38:44,029 --> 01:38:47,462
"will never whimper a protest."

1221
01:38:47,654 --> 01:38:55,548
"If you wish
tear apart my heart and see."

1222
01:38:55,628 --> 01:39:02,327
"If you're not convinced
then ask my heart."

1223
01:39:02,407 --> 01:39:03,991
"I'm yours."

1224
01:39:05,634 --> 01:39:07,234
"I'm yours."

1225
01:39:08,964 --> 01:39:10,974
"I'm yours."

1226
01:39:11,054 --> 01:39:15,289
"Come and see for yourself."

1227
01:39:15,369 --> 01:39:17,462
"I'm yours."

1228
01:39:23,126 --> 01:39:24,952
Fantastic!

1229
01:39:38,007 --> 01:39:40,492
Shut the door,
and don't let anybody inside.

1230
01:39:41,789 --> 01:39:43,335
How come you've returned so soon?

1231
01:39:46,503 --> 01:39:50,307
Rajasaheb, Ramlal has been
arrested with the diamonds!

1232
01:39:50,545 --> 01:39:52,804
There's no need to worry.
Sit down.

1233
01:39:54,469 --> 01:39:57,291
The diamonds were fake.
- What!

1234
01:39:57,485 --> 01:39:59,064
I didn't know. I was scared...

1235
01:39:59,144 --> 01:40:04,026
Prakash! You still don't know me.
I think of the future.

1236
01:40:04,631 --> 01:40:07,269
So, did you suspect that
Ramlal would get caught?

1237
01:40:07,518 --> 01:40:12,000
I didn't suspect, I was sure.
I wanted to see how shrewd he is.

1238
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:17,363
Now that he's in jail, we know
that he is of no use to us.

1239
01:40:17,606 --> 01:40:20,814
Suppose he reveals about us
to the police, then?

1240
01:40:22,068 --> 01:40:25,145
No. He wouldn't dare.

1241
01:40:25,356 --> 01:40:26,532
Why?

1242
01:40:26,757 --> 01:40:32,664
Because I have promised
to look after his children.

1243
01:40:33,313 --> 01:40:37,024
Whether he gets
imprisoned or divulges.

1244
01:40:38,067 --> 01:40:41,641
Rajasaheb, you are very far-sighted.

1245
01:40:41,721 --> 01:40:42,834
Anyway...

1246
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:46,942
Look at this picture.

1247
01:40:53,117 --> 01:40:54,276
How is she?

1248
01:40:54,907 --> 01:40:56,057
Extremely beautiful.

1249
01:41:00,087 --> 01:41:04,348
She's a golden goose.
She's the only daughter of a rich father.

1250
01:41:05,069 --> 01:41:07,508
Have you heard of Mr. Kishanchand?

1251
01:41:07,896 --> 01:41:10,778
He can buy many rich men like you!

1252
01:41:10,858 --> 01:41:13,926
Yes, but he suffers from
blood pressure problems.

1253
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:20,875
You seem to be plotting a new scheme?

1254
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,466
I've already plotted.

1255
01:41:23,751 --> 01:41:26,510
From now on, you are my
younger brother, Prince Prakashchand.

1256
01:41:26,590 --> 01:41:27,756
Really?

1257
01:41:28,673 --> 01:41:30,885
Only for this job.

1258
01:41:31,112 --> 01:41:32,158
Acting!

1259
01:41:32,815 --> 01:41:35,107
No problem.
What do I have to do?

1260
01:41:35,324 --> 01:41:36,891
Get married.

1261
01:41:37,693 --> 01:41:39,718
To her?
- Yes.

1262
01:41:40,195 --> 01:41:43,990
You are abroad now, and will
return after a couple of days.

1263
01:41:44,777 --> 01:41:47,406
You will then be introduced to Renu.

1264
01:41:48,003 --> 01:41:55,857
Within a month, you'll have to
impress Renu and her father so much..

1265
01:41:55,937 --> 01:41:57,990
..that they will not consider
anyone else but you..

1266
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:00,222
..as being worthy of her husband.

1267
01:42:00,302 --> 01:42:03,526
Okay. Then?
- You'll get married!

1268
01:42:04,927 --> 01:42:08,229
I understand! Then, Renu's
father will suddenly die..

1269
01:42:08,309 --> 01:42:10,253
..and all his wealth
will be mine.

1270
01:42:10,959 --> 01:42:12,722
Not all, only half of it.

1271
01:42:12,802 --> 01:42:14,217
So be it.

1272
01:42:14,511 --> 01:42:20,341
As far as I know, you have
tried such a scheme earlier too.

1273
01:42:20,712 --> 01:42:24,906
Indeed. I did get 7- 8 lakhs
from Kamini's father.

1274
01:42:25,424 --> 01:42:27,711
Did your father-in-law also
have a blood pressure problem?

1275
01:42:27,791 --> 01:42:30,313
No. He was a heart patient.

1276
01:42:34,183 --> 01:42:35,537
What are you thinking?

1277
01:42:35,617 --> 01:42:37,951
It's nothing. I was wondering..

1278
01:42:38,313 --> 01:42:43,150
..why you make such schemes when
you have wealth in abundance?

1279
01:42:43,736 --> 01:42:48,346
Prakash, once you acquire wealth,
you will understand.

1280
01:42:48,952 --> 01:42:51,193
It's the wealthy
who lust for more wealth.

1281
01:42:51,366 --> 01:42:53,217
The hungry need only food.

1282
01:42:53,297 --> 01:42:56,840
And if we don't usurp their
wealth, someone else will.

1283
01:42:57,169 --> 01:42:59,460
After all, we aren't the
only intelligent men around.

1284
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:03,091
Rajasaheb! Madam has
escaped from her room!

1285
01:43:03,171 --> 01:43:03,984
How?!

1286
01:43:04,064 --> 01:43:06,813
She attacked the woman who
went to her room with the food.

1287
01:43:06,893 --> 01:43:09,779
Move.
- Let me go!

1288
01:43:11,482 --> 01:43:13,627
Leave me.
- Kamini!

1289
01:43:14,899 --> 01:43:16,447
How did she come downstairs?

1290
01:43:17,025 --> 01:43:18,583
All of you leave!

1291
01:43:18,663 --> 01:43:20,702
Let me go!

1292
01:43:20,782 --> 01:43:23,910
Kamini! You're getting more and
more insane by the day! Come on!

1293
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:25,891
I am not insane! Let me go!

1294
01:43:25,971 --> 01:43:27,429
All crazy people say that.

1295
01:43:27,672 --> 01:43:29,963
No, I am not crazy.
- Come on, Kamini.

1296
01:43:30,043 --> 01:43:32,500
I won't go there! I'm scared!
- Go to your room.

1297
01:43:32,784 --> 01:43:35,077
I hate you! Leave me!
- Come upstairs!

1298
01:43:35,258 --> 01:43:36,858
Come upstairs!
- No!

1299
01:43:36,938 --> 01:43:38,579
No!!

1300
01:43:39,479 --> 01:43:40,810
Come on.
- Let me go!

1301
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:43,284
Get up, Kamini!
- No!

1302
01:43:44,374 --> 01:43:47,522
No!
- Come on!

1303
01:43:47,789 --> 01:43:48,905
No!

1304
01:43:50,375 --> 01:43:54,022
Leave me. I am not crazy.

1305
01:43:54,508 --> 01:43:59,420
Leave me. I am not crazy.

1306
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:00,562
Leave me.

1307
01:44:04,894 --> 01:44:06,373
Sit down quietly!

1308
01:44:06,453 --> 01:44:09,641
Why should I?
I am not afraid of you.

1309
01:44:09,721 --> 01:44:10,499
Kamini!

1310
01:44:10,579 --> 01:44:12,599
I don't fear your threats anymore.

1311
01:44:12,679 --> 01:44:14,891
You can't silence me anymore.

1312
01:44:14,971 --> 01:44:17,667
I will tell the world
that you are a murderer.

1313
01:44:17,747 --> 01:44:19,414
You poisoned father to death.

1314
01:44:19,494 --> 01:44:22,337
Kamini! Do not forget who I am.

1315
01:44:22,726 --> 01:44:24,257
I can never forget that.

1316
01:44:24,932 --> 01:44:28,061
I can never forget the manager
who betrayed us.

1317
01:44:28,141 --> 01:44:32,717
Wretch! My father was ready
to get me married to Brijmohan.

1318
01:44:33,227 --> 01:44:37,803
But you held me captive that very day
and poisoned my father.

1319
01:44:37,883 --> 01:44:42,577
And when I refused to marry you,
you claimed that I was crazy.

1320
01:44:43,234 --> 01:44:47,878
I can never forget the atrocities
inflicted on me since 10 years.

1321
01:44:48,345 --> 01:44:49,772
I will surely seek vengeance!

1322
01:44:49,980 --> 01:44:53,482
Kamini!
- Leave me! Let go of me!

1323
01:44:57,625 --> 01:45:00,895
She's getting madder by the day!
It isn't safe to keep her here.

1324
01:45:01,196 --> 01:45:03,739
Lock her in her father's empty house.

1325
01:45:04,284 --> 01:45:07,475
She can scream there
as much as she wants to.

1326
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:09,586
Okay, boss.

1327
01:45:13,209 --> 01:45:15,105
Well, you've been
introduced to each other now.

1328
01:45:15,185 --> 01:45:19,062
Sit and talk.
I'll go and meet my solicitor.

1329
01:45:19,142 --> 01:45:20,013
Bye.

1330
01:45:20,281 --> 01:45:21,432
Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight.

1331
01:45:51,832 --> 01:45:53,717
Your house is extremely splendid!

1332
01:45:54,677 --> 01:45:56,949
Pardon?
- Thank you.

1333
01:46:01,552 --> 01:46:03,117
You are quiet again.

1334
01:46:04,562 --> 01:46:05,945
What do I talk about?

1335
01:46:06,377 --> 01:46:09,162
Well... about anything.

1336
01:46:10,113 --> 01:46:11,665
All right.

1337
01:46:13,313 --> 01:46:15,540
Your coat material is good.
- I beg your pardon?

1338
01:46:18,188 --> 01:46:21,175
Did you like it?
I bought it abroad.

1339
01:46:22,006 --> 01:46:24,492
I can see that.
- What?

1340
01:46:24,708 --> 01:46:25,876
Made in England.

1341
01:46:30,266 --> 01:46:31,974
You aren't mocking me, are you?

1342
01:46:32,054 --> 01:46:35,571
What! Do you think
I'm so impertinent?

1343
01:46:35,651 --> 01:46:38,873
No! You appear quite interesting.

1344
01:46:40,008 --> 01:46:43,197
Whatever Rajasaheb told me about you
was nothing in comparison.

1345
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:50,394
Ms. Renu, what are your hobbies?

1346
01:46:51,661 --> 01:46:53,304
Riding.
- Very good.

1347
01:46:53,888 --> 01:46:55,347
Swimming.
- Excellent.

1348
01:46:56,072 --> 01:46:58,040
Especially, motor driving.

1349
01:46:58,120 --> 01:46:59,164
Marvellous.

1350
01:46:59,953 --> 01:47:03,393
Even my hobbies are the same!
I've brought my new car.

1351
01:47:04,539 --> 01:47:05,468
What do you mean?

1352
01:47:05,548 --> 01:47:07,609
Let's go for a drive.
Let's go out somewhere.

1353
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:10,245
My friend will be here at 8:30.

1354
01:47:10,325 --> 01:47:13,507
But it's only 8 O'clock now.
We will be back in half an hour.

1355
01:47:13,587 --> 01:47:14,830
Come on.

1356
01:47:16,019 --> 01:47:17,241
Please.

1357
01:47:30,237 --> 01:47:35,045
Hey, you look so uncomfortable.
Relax. Sit comfortably.

1358
01:47:37,029 --> 01:47:39,253
We should get to
know each other, right?

1359
01:47:40,288 --> 01:47:42,077
You are absolutely right.

1360
01:47:42,607 --> 01:47:44,452
You're very sensible.

1361
01:47:44,532 --> 01:47:46,164
You're no less.

1362
01:47:46,244 --> 01:47:47,202
Thank you.

1363
01:47:47,396 --> 01:47:50,596
One won't find a sensible girl
like you in the whole continent!

1364
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:52,088
Have you searched?

1365
01:47:52,168 --> 01:47:54,460
Even if I tried,
I wouldn't find one!

1366
01:47:54,876 --> 01:47:57,264
I hope you don't mind the speed?

1367
01:47:57,344 --> 01:47:59,450
How fast can you drive?

1368
01:47:59,530 --> 01:48:01,807
I'm driving at 60 kms/hour.
I can take it up to 80.

1369
01:48:01,887 --> 01:48:03,840
I can drive faster.

1370
01:48:04,132 --> 01:48:05,126
You're very smart.

1371
01:48:05,206 --> 01:48:07,634
But if you want to see how fast
I drive, come tomorrow.

1372
01:48:07,714 --> 01:48:09,969
Tomorrow?
- Yes. At Juhu airport.

1373
01:48:10,049 --> 01:48:11,316
A motor racing is going to be held.

1374
01:48:11,396 --> 01:48:13,115
Even I have enlisted my name
for motor racing.

1375
01:48:13,510 --> 01:48:16,866
If you come, I'll surely win.
You will come, won't you?

1376
01:48:17,212 --> 01:48:20,957
Yes, I will have to come now.
Or you will not win!

1377
01:48:30,489 --> 01:48:34,936
Mannu, your work is over.
Then why are you waiting here?

1378
01:48:35,187 --> 01:48:36,710
For no reason.
- Really?

1379
01:48:37,402 --> 01:48:39,313
I know why!
- Why?

1380
01:48:39,503 --> 01:48:43,161
What's the use of sulking?
Go and meet her.

1381
01:48:43,628 --> 01:48:45,074
I won't!

1382
01:48:45,154 --> 01:48:49,915
You are hopeless! Come back in a jiffy.
Brother will never know.

1383
01:48:49,995 --> 01:48:53,089
You will tell him everything!
- That's the problem, Mannu.

1384
01:48:53,169 --> 01:48:57,352
I can't keep things to myself.
I try to please brother and you.

1385
01:48:57,432 --> 01:49:01,757
You are the youngest.
I love you so much. It's such a problem!

1386
01:49:01,837 --> 01:49:03,131
Brother is coming.

1387
01:49:03,583 --> 01:49:05,656
It's such a problem!
- What's the problem?

1388
01:49:05,736 --> 01:49:08,003
Nothing as such... Renu's phone...

1389
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:10,537
Hadn't I warned you?
- Brother!

1390
01:49:10,995 --> 01:49:12,346
Did I say a thing?!

1391
01:49:14,447 --> 01:49:15,779
It must be Renu.

1392
01:49:16,316 --> 01:49:17,518
Hello, Mohan Garage.

1393
01:49:18,149 --> 01:49:21,083
Renu? Wait.

1394
01:49:21,163 --> 01:49:22,604
It's some other girl.

1395
01:49:22,684 --> 01:49:26,360
Hello. Pardon?
Whom do you want to speak to?

1396
01:49:27,266 --> 01:49:29,868
Jagmohan? It's your call.

1397
01:49:29,948 --> 01:49:33,159
Jagmohan? How can that be?
Which girl would phone me?

1398
01:49:33,329 --> 01:49:35,369
Hello.
- This is Sheela here.

1399
01:49:35,699 --> 01:49:38,163
Sheela!
- Sheela?

1400
01:49:38,916 --> 01:49:40,496
Chevrolet.

1401
01:49:40,576 --> 01:49:41,327
What are you saying?

1402
01:49:41,407 --> 01:49:43,127
An emergency case of a Chevrolet!

1403
01:49:43,207 --> 01:49:45,049
It is an emergency case
of a Chevrolet.

1404
01:49:45,129 --> 01:49:50,101
Hello! I's an emergency
case of a Chevrolet car!

1405
01:49:50,181 --> 01:49:51,540
Hello?
- Let me talk.

1406
01:49:51,620 --> 01:49:54,180
Which Chevrolet car, and whose?

1407
01:49:54,563 --> 01:49:58,056
Emergency? What are you talking
about? What's wrong with you?

1408
01:49:58,506 --> 01:50:01,550
Nothing.. what's wrong with your car?

1409
01:50:01,732 --> 01:50:04,964
My car?
My car is fine, gentleman.

1410
01:50:05,044 --> 01:50:07,556
But are you feeling fine?

1411
01:50:08,062 --> 01:50:08,882
Pardon?

1412
01:50:08,962 --> 01:50:11,359
You had said that
you would take me out?

1413
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:13,190
Yes, I did.
Move aside!

1414
01:50:14,236 --> 01:50:15,409
What are you doing today?

1415
01:50:15,489 --> 01:50:19,769
We are very busy today,
so I will not be able to come.

1416
01:50:19,849 --> 01:50:22,486
Why don't you come to the car
race tomorrow at the airdrome?

1417
01:50:22,566 --> 01:50:28,332
Meet me there. I'll repair
your car... your Chevrolet there.

1418
01:50:28,964 --> 01:50:31,217
You will meet me, won't you?

1419
01:50:31,297 --> 01:50:33,201
Very good. Please do come.

1420
01:50:34,862 --> 01:50:38,421
Brother Jaggu, what kind of
an emergency case is this?

1421
01:50:39,644 --> 01:50:41,314
Emergency is emergency.

1422
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:02,456
Hey!
- You!

1423
01:51:03,185 --> 01:51:04,952
We could have come together.

1424
01:51:05,032 --> 01:51:06,481
I didn't know you were also coming.

1425
01:51:06,561 --> 01:51:09,962
I had to come for Mr. Prakash.
But what are you doing here?

1426
01:51:10,042 --> 01:51:12,464
My round, chubby man is here.
- Where is he?!

1427
01:51:12,672 --> 01:51:15,880
Do you see that old car?
That's him near it.

1428
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:20,673
Hey! So, even they are here?
That's fantastic!

1429
01:51:26,094 --> 01:51:29,528
Hail Lord Hanuman!

1430
01:51:32,952 --> 01:51:34,050
Pay your respects.

1431
01:51:38,436 --> 01:51:39,871
Best of luck.

1432
01:51:58,031 --> 01:51:59,302
Brother Jaggu!

1433
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:06,520
Look, what's happened!
- What's wrong?

1434
01:52:06,716 --> 01:52:08,251
Push it.

1435
01:52:48,078 --> 01:52:51,797
Hey, move back!

1436
01:52:55,917 --> 01:52:59,573
Hey, my cap! Give my cap.

1437
01:52:59,674 --> 01:53:02,208
Here, take your cap.

1438
01:54:33,512 --> 01:54:34,852
Mannu!

1439
01:54:55,188 --> 01:54:57,934
The first prize this year
goes to Manmohan Sharma.

1440
01:55:02,052 --> 01:55:03,912
Hip Hip Hurray!

1441
01:55:14,085 --> 01:55:17,275
Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1442
01:55:18,562 --> 01:55:20,032
Renu.
- Congratulations.

1443
01:55:20,112 --> 01:55:20,592
Thank you.

1444
01:55:20,672 --> 01:55:22,670
How are you, Renu?
- So you did recognise me?

1445
01:55:22,750 --> 01:55:24,999
How could I not?
- I thought you'd forgotten me.

1446
01:55:25,079 --> 01:55:26,286
How can I?

1447
01:55:26,366 --> 01:55:29,744
I thought you were angry and
would call once you calmed down.

1448
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:32,483
Even you could have phoned!
- I could.

1449
01:55:32,563 --> 01:55:34,726
But then I feared that
you would get more furious.

1450
01:55:34,806 --> 01:55:37,752
I am crazy, am I not?
- Yes. No!

1451
01:55:38,092 --> 01:55:40,255
Renu, well actually...

1452
01:55:40,335 --> 01:55:43,962
I've not been able to understand
you and your moods.

1453
01:55:44,042 --> 01:55:46,370
Well, you talk that way!
- I promise it won't happen again.

1454
01:55:46,450 --> 01:55:47,902
But please don't get angry.

1455
01:55:48,601 --> 01:55:50,744
Hold your ears once again.
- Here!

1456
01:55:52,067 --> 01:55:55,357
Mr. Prakash, I suppose
I wasn't lucky for you.

1457
01:55:55,437 --> 01:55:57,612
Mannu won the prize instead.
- Manmohan.

1458
01:55:57,692 --> 01:56:00,952
I forgot the introductions.
Manmohan... He's Prince..

1459
01:56:01,032 --> 01:56:01,971
Prakashchand.

1460
01:56:02,051 --> 01:56:04,279
He is the prince
about whom I'd mentioned.

1461
01:56:04,359 --> 01:56:05,136
Prince?

1462
01:56:06,243 --> 01:56:07,232
Glad to meet you.

1463
01:56:09,495 --> 01:56:10,555
Let's go. We're getting late.

1464
01:56:10,635 --> 01:56:13,101
Okay. Bye, Mannu.
- Bye bye.

1465
01:56:14,519 --> 01:56:15,571
Bye bye.

1466
01:56:18,755 --> 01:56:19,730
Renu!

1467
01:56:20,637 --> 01:56:22,561
I was looking for you,
and you were here.

1468
01:56:22,641 --> 01:56:25,400
Renu, this is important!
- What is it?

1469
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:27,235
Let's go somewhere else.

1470
01:56:27,315 --> 01:56:29,579
Excuse me. I'll be back soon.
- Let's go.

1471
01:56:34,322 --> 01:56:37,780
Renu, has your marriage
been fixed with this prince?

1472
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:41,249
Yes. Don't you like him?

1473
01:56:41,329 --> 01:56:46,198
I may be mistaken, but he's
the prince of which realm?

1474
01:56:46,548 --> 01:56:47,822
How would I know!

1475
01:56:47,902 --> 01:56:50,598
Are you blindly marrying him?
- Yes. Why?

1476
01:56:51,211 --> 01:56:53,259
No! Please don't marry him.

1477
01:56:55,709 --> 01:56:58,479
I had told you the other day
itself that you're a bit jealous. - No.

1478
01:56:58,559 --> 01:57:00,717
However, you had disagreed.
But it's turned out to be true.

1479
01:57:00,797 --> 01:57:02,770
Yes. No, you don't understand.

1480
01:57:02,850 --> 01:57:03,938
I do.

1481
01:57:04,018 --> 01:57:08,412
I think I had seen him dumping
Lalchand's body the other day.

1482
01:57:08,794 --> 01:57:09,617
Yes.

1483
01:57:09,697 --> 01:57:12,825
What are you saying, Mannu!
- The truth, Renu.

1484
01:57:13,298 --> 01:57:16,981
The same looks, the same style.

1485
01:57:17,061 --> 01:57:18,626
And the same hairstyle.

1486
01:57:18,832 --> 01:57:21,233
Enough, Mannu! Water!

1487
01:57:21,918 --> 01:57:24,430
Water, please!

1488
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:26,056
Coca Cola.

1489
01:57:29,508 --> 01:57:30,310
Renu.

1490
01:57:31,334 --> 01:57:34,358
Renu, are you all right?

1491
01:57:34,882 --> 01:57:36,267
Are you sure?

1492
01:57:36,347 --> 01:57:40,377
Absolutely, Renu.
I never forget faces all my life!

1493
01:57:40,537 --> 01:57:43,878
Mannu, let's inform the police.
- Okay.

1494
01:57:43,958 --> 01:57:47,373
No, wait. If you're wrong,
we'll get into trouble.

1495
01:57:47,975 --> 01:57:50,363
So what do we do?
- What do we do?

1496
01:57:50,625 --> 01:57:53,659
I know! We should become spies.

1497
01:57:53,739 --> 01:57:55,227
Yes!
- Good idea?

1498
01:57:55,307 --> 01:57:57,427
He's looking our way.
- Who?

1499
01:58:00,388 --> 01:58:03,130
We must follow him on the sly.

1500
01:58:03,210 --> 01:58:04,706
Don't move your hand so much.

1501
01:58:04,786 --> 01:58:08,676
And we must find out
what exactly he does.

1502
01:58:09,229 --> 01:58:10,551
You'll be with me, won't you?
- Of course.

1503
01:58:10,631 --> 01:58:13,546
All right, as soon as I
get a chance, I'll phone you.

1504
01:58:16,327 --> 01:58:19,291
Won't your brothers object?
- In this matter, I don't care!

1505
01:58:19,371 --> 01:58:20,208
Very good.

1506
01:58:22,346 --> 01:58:24,055
Don't feel nervous.
- Ofcourse not.

1507
01:58:27,134 --> 01:58:29,265
Bye, Mannu.
- Bye.

1508
01:58:33,693 --> 01:58:34,701
Spies!

1509
01:58:48,425 --> 01:58:49,830
I am a spy.

1510
01:58:52,030 --> 01:58:54,427
What's happening?

1511
01:58:56,224 --> 01:58:57,726
Brother Jaggu, in love?

1512
01:58:58,766 --> 01:59:01,161
Well, won't you
introduce me to her?

1513
01:59:01,241 --> 01:59:04,541
What are you doing here?
Let's go home!

1514
01:59:05,687 --> 01:59:06,976
Your friend?

1515
01:59:08,257 --> 01:59:10,657
You befriend an ordinary mechanic?

1516
01:59:10,737 --> 01:59:12,726
What's wrong with that?

1517
01:59:13,003 --> 01:59:15,159
But I certainly
do not approve of it!

1518
01:59:16,698 --> 01:59:18,666
However, I like it.
- But I don't approve of..

1519
01:59:18,746 --> 01:59:21,909
..you joking around with
an ordinary mechanic in public.

1520
01:59:21,989 --> 01:59:24,445
I didn't know
you were so petty-minded.

1521
01:59:24,525 --> 01:59:26,797
And I didn't know
you were so shameless.

1522
01:59:26,877 --> 01:59:29,558
Shut up.
Who are you to say such things?!

1523
01:59:29,638 --> 01:59:31,200
Your future husband!

1524
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:34,272
Future husband! But you aren't!
And you never will be!

1525
01:59:38,810 --> 01:59:41,035
Why were you introduced to Renu?

1526
01:59:41,115 --> 01:59:42,844
Well...
- For business.

1527
01:59:43,418 --> 01:59:45,149
And not to fall in love with her.

1528
01:59:45,882 --> 01:59:49,686
You can get plenty of girls
but not a rich girl like Renu.

1529
01:59:50,367 --> 01:59:54,546
If you do want to fall in love,
then it will be done my way.

1530
01:59:56,172 --> 01:59:58,711
You will get Renu,
and I will get the wealth.

1531
02:00:01,042 --> 02:00:05,179
Well, Mr. Kumar,
learn from my experiences.

1532
02:00:11,964 --> 02:00:17,294
Wow! It's beautiful!
But, son, such expensive gifts...

1533
02:00:17,374 --> 02:00:21,380
It's not my fault. Rajasaheb has
personally chosen it and sent it.

1534
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:26,445
This is not fair.
I'll speak to him about it.

1535
02:00:27,061 --> 02:00:30,168
It's a gift,
so it can't even be returned.

1536
02:00:30,666 --> 02:00:32,229
My dear, please accept them.

1537
02:00:33,592 --> 02:00:36,802
Sir, the car is ready.
- Please keep these upstairs.

1538
02:00:37,992 --> 02:00:41,956
Renu, sit with him. I have
some important work to attend to.

1539
02:00:42,157 --> 02:00:43,347
Okay, bye.

1540
02:00:54,915 --> 02:00:56,764
Please sit.
- After you, please.

1541
02:00:59,377 --> 02:01:02,421
I think you're angry with me?

1542
02:01:02,982 --> 02:01:05,773
No, I am not. Why?

1543
02:01:06,185 --> 02:01:11,436
I apologise for whatever
I said after the car race.

1544
02:01:12,094 --> 02:01:13,781
I came here to say that I'm sorry.

1545
02:01:14,233 --> 02:01:18,985
Sorry?
I didn't take it to heart at all.

1546
02:01:19,415 --> 02:01:23,280
Really? And I was worried sick,
wondering what you'd be thinking.

1547
02:01:23,593 --> 02:01:25,005
How sweet of you!

1548
02:01:26,347 --> 02:01:28,588
Permit me to leave now.

1549
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:31,390
Are you leaving already?

1550
02:01:31,675 --> 02:01:34,802
Yes, I have some important work.

1551
02:01:36,649 --> 02:01:38,240
Please sit for a while.

1552
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:40,651
I surely would.
But somebody is waiting for me.

1553
02:01:40,731 --> 02:01:42,803
Won't you stay
even at my request?

1554
02:01:42,883 --> 02:01:44,833
Let me go today.
- Fine.

1555
02:01:44,913 --> 02:01:47,035
Then I'll assume that you're
the one who's angry with me.

1556
02:01:47,115 --> 02:01:49,838
How can I be angry with you?

1557
02:01:49,918 --> 02:01:53,012
Then sit down. Just a minute.

1558
02:01:53,381 --> 02:01:54,363
Please.

1559
02:01:56,356 --> 02:01:57,401
Thank you.

1560
02:02:09,337 --> 02:02:12,727
Hello? Mohan Brother's Garage.
Who's speaking?

1561
02:02:13,613 --> 02:02:17,507
Renu! It's a girl? I'll be dead!
Sir, there's a girl on the line.

1562
02:02:17,587 --> 02:02:18,646
A girl?

1563
02:02:19,135 --> 02:02:20,090
Hello?

1564
02:02:20,899 --> 02:02:22,645
Renu?
- He's here.

1565
02:02:22,725 --> 02:02:25,580
He's there?
- And he wants to leave right now.

1566
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:29,686
Don't. Keep him engrossed.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.

1567
02:02:29,766 --> 02:02:31,859
Come soon.
- I'll be there in a jiffy.

1568
02:02:32,122 --> 02:02:33,548
How will I know?

1569
02:02:34,676 --> 02:02:41,251
I'll park my car a little away
from your house and honk twice.

1570
02:02:41,331 --> 02:02:42,967
Okay?
- All right.

1571
02:02:44,449 --> 02:02:46,671
I'm sorry, but I'm getting late.

1572
02:02:47,347 --> 02:02:51,368
"Hey you!
Please wait awhile."

1573
02:02:51,962 --> 02:02:53,636
"What's the hurry?"

1574
02:02:54,266 --> 02:02:57,877
"Thorns of separation
will prick me all the while."

1575
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:00,798
"Hey you!
Please wait awhile."

1576
02:03:01,171 --> 02:03:03,170
"What's the hurry?"

1577
02:03:03,454 --> 02:03:07,688
"Thorns of separation
will prick me all the while."

1578
02:03:21,727 --> 02:03:26,024
"Twilight descends
and you get set to go, beloved."

1579
02:03:26,335 --> 02:03:30,710
"For my sake
don't go away from me."

1580
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:35,248
"Twilight descends
and you get set to go, beloved."

1581
02:03:35,518 --> 02:03:39,766
"For my sake
don't go away from me."

1582
02:03:40,112 --> 02:03:44,296
"My love, don't be so unjust."

1583
02:03:44,966 --> 02:03:48,595
"I'm a girl so delicate."

1584
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:51,208
"Hey you!
Please wait awhile."

1585
02:03:51,603 --> 02:03:53,429
"What's the hurry?"

1586
02:03:53,893 --> 02:03:57,948
"Thorns of separation
will prick me all the while."

1587
02:04:11,793 --> 02:04:16,529
"I want to tell you so many things,
so let me say it all."

1588
02:04:17,070 --> 02:04:21,620
"This heart full of love holds
many things, so let me say it all."

1589
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:25,955
"I want to tell you so many things,
so let me say it all."

1590
02:04:26,334 --> 02:04:30,831
"This heart full of love holds
many things, so let me say it all."

1591
02:04:30,911 --> 02:04:35,176
"Wait awhile, my love,
let me come to my senses."

1592
02:04:35,753 --> 02:04:38,975
"Since the time you've come,
I've been a little lost."

1593
02:04:40,109 --> 02:04:41,925
"Hey you!
Please wait awhile."

1594
02:04:42,433 --> 02:04:43,947
"What's the hurry?"

1595
02:04:44,693 --> 02:04:48,542
"Thorns of separation
will prick me all the while."

1596
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:07,003
"Just think,
what I am receiving for loving you."

1597
02:05:07,544 --> 02:05:11,815
"Just think, my love
a thousand deaths I die."

1598
02:05:12,149 --> 02:05:16,300
"Just think,
what I am receiving for loving you."

1599
02:05:16,667 --> 02:05:20,778
"Just think, my love
a thousand deaths I die."

1600
02:05:21,243 --> 02:05:25,416
"Wait awhile
don't break my heart."

1601
02:05:26,065 --> 02:05:29,833
"But a man who spurns love
will never give this a thought."

1602
02:05:30,477 --> 02:05:32,195
"Hey you!
Please wait awhile."

1603
02:05:32,275 --> 02:05:34,175
"What's the hurry?"

1604
02:05:35,039 --> 02:05:38,628
"Thorns of separation
will prick me all the while."

1605
02:05:39,505 --> 02:05:41,235
"Hey you!
Please wait awhile."

1606
02:05:41,818 --> 02:05:43,591
"What's the hurry?"

1607
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:47,495
"Thorns of separation
will prick me all the while."

1608
02:05:49,646 --> 02:05:51,224
You're interesting!

1609
02:06:00,099 --> 02:06:05,869
I'm not sure you'll give me a place
I deserve in your heart.

1610
02:06:08,822 --> 02:06:10,873
You're getting late.
- No, I'm not.

1611
02:06:10,953 --> 02:06:14,878
Even if all of the beautiful
girls in the world beckon me..

1612
02:06:15,234 --> 02:06:17,472
..I wouldn't be
willing to leave you now.

1613
02:06:18,401 --> 02:06:19,287
No?

1614
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:21,915
How sweet.

1615
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:25,113
But you'd said that you
have some important work.

1616
02:06:25,193 --> 02:06:28,162
Yes, I did have work but
that work can be done tomorrow.

1617
02:06:28,769 --> 02:06:32,896
No. I don't want your work
to suffer because of me.

1618
02:06:33,763 --> 02:06:37,647
Your work is important.
Don't bother about me, I'll wait.

1619
02:06:38,944 --> 02:06:42,828
You are asking me to leave?
- Yes. No!

1620
02:06:42,908 --> 02:06:46,545
I mean, I hope there are
opportunities like this again!

1621
02:06:46,813 --> 02:06:48,378
And that I get
a chance to stop you again!

1622
02:06:49,243 --> 02:06:50,843
How sweet, Renu!

1623
02:06:51,942 --> 02:06:53,230
How sweet of you.

1624
02:06:55,245 --> 02:06:58,922
You are so nice!
I just don't feel like going.

1625
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:00,923
Even I don't want you to go.

1626
02:07:01,084 --> 02:07:04,526
Okay, bye.
- Bye bye.

1627
02:07:12,855 --> 02:07:14,533
Renu.
- Yes?

1628
02:07:14,613 --> 02:07:16,900
Renu.
- Yes?

1629
02:07:16,980 --> 02:07:18,486
1Stop saying my name
and say something!

1630
02:07:18,566 --> 02:07:20,939
Do you think he suspects
that we're following him?

1631
02:07:21,019 --> 02:07:23,512
Suspects? How's that possible?

1632
02:07:23,592 --> 02:07:26,772
Look! He's driving slowly now.
- You too slow down.

1633
02:07:27,127 --> 02:07:31,062
We must keep a safe distance.
If he turns, he'll recognise us.

1634
02:07:31,142 --> 02:07:33,181
You shouldn't have come with me.
- Why?

1635
02:07:33,261 --> 02:07:36,284
He can recognise you from afar.
- But how can he, in this car?!

1636
02:07:36,364 --> 02:07:39,310
You're beautiful and it is
hard to hide a beautiful face.

1637
02:07:39,390 --> 02:07:42,290
That's enough.
He can recognize you too.

1638
02:07:42,370 --> 02:07:45,193
How?
- He's seen you at the car race.

1639
02:07:45,273 --> 02:07:46,906
Oh yes!

1640
02:07:46,986 --> 02:07:50,140
What are you doing? There will be
an accident. Please don't honk.

1641
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:51,973
What to do? He'll recognise me!

1642
02:07:52,504 --> 02:07:54,700
You make me also nervous!

1643
02:08:04,033 --> 02:08:06,785
Renu... look at me now.

1644
02:08:09,967 --> 02:08:11,994
He won't recognise me now.

1645
02:08:13,313 --> 02:08:15,557
Even I cannot recognise you!

1646
02:08:15,637 --> 02:08:18,164
Don't laugh or we'll get into trouble.

1647
02:08:18,502 --> 02:08:22,806
Do one thing... Don't laugh!
Change your appearance.

1648
02:08:23,244 --> 02:08:24,642
How do I do that?

1649
02:08:24,722 --> 02:08:26,968
I have an extra set of clothes.
Wear them.

1650
02:08:27,048 --> 02:08:28,490
How can I wear your clothes?

1651
02:08:28,570 --> 02:08:32,788
Don't joke! We'll be in trouble.
Please go.

1652
02:08:35,469 --> 02:08:36,680
Don't laugh!

1653
02:08:38,256 --> 02:08:41,021
CPV65!

1654
02:08:45,190 --> 02:08:46,935
Renu!
- Yes?

1655
02:08:47,015 --> 02:08:48,691
Renu!
- Yes?

1656
02:08:48,771 --> 02:08:50,434
Have you worn them?

1657
02:08:51,608 --> 02:08:53,035
Hurry up. Don't laugh!

1658
02:08:55,647 --> 02:08:56,633
Renu!

1659
02:08:57,394 --> 02:08:58,912
Don't look behind!

1660
02:09:04,285 --> 02:09:07,254
I've worn the clothes.
Hey, you'll cause an accident!

1661
02:09:07,334 --> 02:09:08,662
Come in the front.

1662
02:09:10,399 --> 02:09:11,532
What are you doing?

1663
02:09:17,785 --> 02:09:20,822
Hey! He has stopped the car.
You also do the same.

1664
02:09:20,902 --> 02:09:21,687
Okay.

1665
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:52,681
Mannu, he's entered the lane.
What we do now?

1666
02:09:52,955 --> 02:09:54,486
Let's follow him.
- Okay.

1667
02:09:54,566 --> 02:09:58,058
Don't! If he comes back,
then it'll be a big problem.

1668
02:09:58,453 --> 02:10:00,508
What do we do then?
- What do we do?

1669
02:10:01,297 --> 02:10:03,074
We'll wait here.
- All right.

1670
02:10:05,842 --> 02:10:07,295
What's wrong?
- Someone is following me!

1671
02:10:07,375 --> 02:10:07,859
Police?

1672
02:10:07,939 --> 02:10:11,546
I don't know. But we should be alert.
Where is my disguise?

1673
02:10:11,626 --> 02:10:12,823
I'll get it.

1674
02:10:14,885 --> 02:10:16,526
I'd like to know who they are.

1675
02:10:16,606 --> 02:10:18,704
The car looks familiar.
Is everything in there?

1676
02:10:19,209 --> 02:10:23,083
Where is it?
You go and stand next to my car.

1677
02:10:23,163 --> 02:10:25,560
I'll disguise myself
and see who they are.

1678
02:10:25,640 --> 02:10:29,093
We have to unload the goods.
I hope the plan doesn't get foiled.

1679
02:10:29,173 --> 02:10:31,628
Don't worry. I'll tackle
them in a jiffy! Be ready.

1680
02:10:31,708 --> 02:10:33,113
Okay. And then, we'll go there.

1681
02:10:33,749 --> 02:10:36,345
It's been so long
but he still hasn't returned.

1682
02:10:37,113 --> 02:10:38,573
I don't think he will come now.

1683
02:10:38,653 --> 02:10:39,745
What!

1684
02:10:40,005 --> 02:10:41,754
His car is here.
Why won't he come?

1685
02:10:41,834 --> 02:10:44,558
Renu, it's possible
that their hideout is here.

1686
02:10:45,290 --> 02:10:46,560
Yes!

1687
02:10:47,255 --> 02:10:49,296
They must be surely
having a meeting.

1688
02:10:49,608 --> 02:10:51,718
Let's inform the police soon.
- Come on!

1689
02:11:11,307 --> 02:11:13,528
Police. Police.

1690
02:11:13,881 --> 02:11:14,739
Police.

1691
02:11:15,337 --> 02:11:17,275
Mannu, he is an insane.

1692
02:11:22,230 --> 02:11:24,263
What's happening?

1693
02:11:26,251 --> 02:11:27,053
Renu!

1694
02:11:27,133 --> 02:11:29,433
What's wrong?
- The tyre is punctured!

1695
02:11:29,590 --> 02:11:30,939
Oh no!

1696
02:11:32,055 --> 02:11:33,869
Hey, the car is leaving!

1697
02:12:03,545 --> 02:12:04,842
You haven't slept as yet?

1698
02:12:04,922 --> 02:12:06,639
Where were you?
- I had gone out.

1699
02:12:07,047 --> 02:12:09,998
I asked, where were you?
- I had some important work.

1700
02:12:10,078 --> 02:12:12,840
You go out with a girl at 1 a.m.
And tell me, it was important!

1701
02:12:13,333 --> 02:12:16,241
A girl?
- Didn't that girl phone you?

1702
02:12:18,443 --> 02:12:20,654
And hadn't I asked you
not to go?!

1703
02:12:21,704 --> 02:12:24,849
Then why did you go?
Answer me!

1704
02:12:25,389 --> 02:12:27,542
Our opinions about girls
do not match.

1705
02:12:27,622 --> 02:12:29,557
Look at the way he talks!
- Mannu, speak politely!

1706
02:12:29,637 --> 02:12:31,495
You back answer me!
- No.

1707
02:12:31,575 --> 02:12:33,461
I'll smash your teeth!

1708
02:12:33,701 --> 02:12:37,660
You can smash my teeth
but you can't snatch my freedom!

1709
02:12:37,931 --> 02:12:40,318
So you won't heed me?
- Not if you're wrong!

1710
02:12:40,398 --> 02:12:44,106
I'll box your head!
- Please don't fight.

1711
02:12:44,186 --> 02:12:45,939
Bring my boxing gloves.
- Gloves!

1712
02:12:46,019 --> 02:12:47,321
Wonderful sport!

1713
02:12:47,401 --> 02:12:49,677
I won't fight!
- Indeed! You're only a kid!

1714
02:12:49,757 --> 02:12:52,640
You're afraid! You can
only roam out with girls!

1715
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:55,730
Brother! If you challenge me,
I will surely fight!

1716
02:12:55,810 --> 02:12:57,599
Gloves.
- Gloves.

1717
02:13:00,038 --> 02:13:03,686
Since you are a boxing champion,
you will use only one hand.

1718
02:13:04,043 --> 02:13:05,410
Give him the gloves!

1719
02:13:06,750 --> 02:13:09,703
Mannu, don't lose this opportunity.
Use both your hands.

1720
02:13:10,260 --> 02:13:11,494
I'm going.

1721
02:13:14,489 --> 02:13:16,721
So, kid, are you ready?

1722
02:13:18,399 --> 02:13:19,667
Ready.
- Ready.

1723
02:13:19,921 --> 02:13:22,307
Mannu, brother knows the rules.
Let me explain them to you.

1724
02:13:22,387 --> 02:13:23,657
Below the belt is a foul.

1725
02:13:23,838 --> 02:13:25,257
Come on shake hands.
Ready?

1726
02:13:25,533 --> 02:13:26,450
Start.

1727
02:13:37,832 --> 02:13:40,311
You threw brother down!

1728
02:13:40,391 --> 02:13:41,991
Wow! Very good!

1729
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:00,250
Will you meet that girl again?
- I will!

1730
02:14:02,534 --> 02:14:05,759
Now say, will you meet her?
- I will!

1731
02:14:09,842 --> 02:14:11,269
Very good.

1732
02:14:12,869 --> 02:14:14,768
I'll be dead!

1733
02:14:15,788 --> 02:14:19,569
You dare hit the referee!
You're disqualified! He hit me!

1734
02:14:19,649 --> 02:14:21,775
Not here. He's over there.

1735
02:14:41,869 --> 02:14:45,988
Two.. three.. four..

1736
02:15:11,294 --> 02:15:12,684
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1737
02:15:12,764 --> 02:15:14,828
Please take a seat.
- You sit.

1738
02:15:16,570 --> 02:15:19,478
Please sit.
- You sit. I want to talk to you.

1739
02:15:21,943 --> 02:15:23,632
What's your name? I forgot.

1740
02:15:24,128 --> 02:15:25,349
Renu.

1741
02:15:25,873 --> 02:15:28,863
Renu, please try to understand
whatever I'm going to say.

1742
02:15:28,943 --> 02:15:29,910
Okay.

1743
02:15:29,990 --> 02:15:33,845
You know, we are 3 brothers.
I have raised both of them.

1744
02:15:34,365 --> 02:15:37,641
They have always respected me
but today he didn't heed me.

1745
02:15:37,721 --> 02:15:41,209
I'm talking about Mannu.
And you are responsible.

1746
02:15:41,289 --> 02:15:42,847
Me?
- Sit down.

1747
02:15:43,467 --> 02:15:46,881
You are wealthy
and want to enjoy life.

1748
02:15:46,961 --> 02:15:49,484
But I don't want you to
enjoy at my brother's expense.

1749
02:15:49,564 --> 02:15:51,085
What?
- Listen to me first.

1750
02:15:51,165 --> 02:15:54,862
He is immature. His life could
get ruined... Let me finish.

1751
02:15:55,597 --> 02:15:59,067
Therefore, I want you
to stop meeting him.

1752
02:16:00,256 --> 02:16:01,306
That's it.

1753
02:16:01,478 --> 02:16:02,876
Did you come, only to say this?

1754
02:16:03,207 --> 02:16:06,100
It's not a petty matter for me.
- Neither is it for me!

1755
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:08,876
I have never enjoyed
myself at Mannu's cost.

1756
02:16:09,770 --> 02:16:13,478
I know why you're saying this.
- What do you know?!

1757
02:16:13,694 --> 02:16:16,911
A girl jilted you and hurt you!

1758
02:16:16,991 --> 02:16:19,914
But it does not mean that
all girls are the same!

1759
02:16:19,994 --> 02:16:23,024
When the time comes,
I will prove it!

1760
02:16:23,273 --> 02:16:25,899
All girls are the same!
Well, I don't want to argue with you!

1761
02:16:25,979 --> 02:16:28,202
All I want is for you
to stop meeting Mannu!

1762
02:16:30,429 --> 02:16:31,539
Would that make you happy?

1763
02:16:31,619 --> 02:16:34,474
I'm not talking of my happiness.
- Will Mannu be happy?

1764
02:16:37,641 --> 02:16:42,109
If it makes Mannu happy,
then I will never meet him.

1765
02:16:45,663 --> 02:16:46,920
Listen!

1766
02:16:51,782 --> 02:16:54,604
I could never understand women
nor explain to them!

1767
02:16:54,684 --> 02:16:58,931
I had asked you to understand me
but you have begun to cry.

1768
02:17:00,896 --> 02:17:03,458
Well, I love my brothers very much.

1769
02:17:03,538 --> 02:17:08,556
If Mannu ever gets hurt the way
I did, then I'll go crazy!

1770
02:17:08,636 --> 02:17:10,738
You know I am a boxer,
and I think like one too.

1771
02:17:13,544 --> 02:17:16,746
I guess I had a wrong impression
about you.

1772
02:17:20,766 --> 02:17:22,128
Wipe your tears.

1773
02:17:23,339 --> 02:17:26,528
I forgot your name again.
- Renu.

1774
02:17:26,831 --> 02:17:31,158
Renu, don't tell Mannu that I had
come here to discuss all this.

1775
02:17:31,956 --> 02:17:33,967
He's my younger brother.
He will feel bad.

1776
02:17:34,345 --> 02:17:35,686
And...

1777
02:17:36,070 --> 02:17:39,663
And that's all. I'm leaving.
Do what you please.

1778
02:17:40,007 --> 02:17:41,975
You needn't touch my feet.

1779
02:17:56,452 --> 02:17:59,123
It's indeed very unfair!

1780
02:17:59,544 --> 02:18:02,734
Big brother is a boxer.
He can box us whenever he pleases.

1781
02:18:02,814 --> 02:18:05,793
What can we younger brothers do?

1782
02:18:06,226 --> 02:18:12,495
Well, if a girl and a boy meet,
what's wrong in that?

1783
02:18:12,938 --> 02:18:15,781
And suppose
they come home late..

1784
02:18:15,861 --> 02:18:18,739
..does it mean they should
get beaten? That's wrong!

1785
02:18:18,819 --> 02:18:21,508
Will you remain silent?
- All right!

1786
02:18:22,159 --> 02:18:26,816
How can I remain silent?
But why did you get late?

1787
02:18:30,657 --> 02:18:32,761
The tyre got punctured.
- Oh, I see!

1788
02:18:32,841 --> 02:18:35,803
Get lost!
The tyre got puncture, indeed!

1789
02:18:35,883 --> 02:18:38,553
Tell me what happened?
I won't tell anyone.

1790
02:18:38,633 --> 02:18:40,549
Please tell me.
Why did you get late?

1791
02:18:40,629 --> 02:18:41,932
Shall I?
- Yes.

1792
02:18:42,012 --> 02:18:45,059
Let brother come. I'll tell him,
you were asking me all this!

1793
02:18:45,139 --> 02:18:47,395
Why involve him?
This is unsporting.

1794
02:18:47,475 --> 02:18:50,114
I'll tell him everything.
- You are being rude.

1795
02:18:51,747 --> 02:18:54,645
Let brother come,
I'll tell him everything.

1796
02:18:55,282 --> 02:18:58,391
Brother, he...
- He...

1797
02:18:58,471 --> 02:19:00,252
You keep quiet! You tell me.

1798
02:19:00,354 --> 02:19:05,000
This is unfair. Is it right
to go out with girls at night?

1799
02:19:05,703 --> 02:19:08,562
But why are you after him?
- I am not.

1800
02:19:09,096 --> 02:19:12,796
You were the one who'd asked us
not to get involved with girls...

1801
02:19:13,488 --> 02:19:15,261
Hello. Mohan motor garage.

1802
02:19:15,520 --> 02:19:17,217
Yes? Renu.

1803
02:19:17,488 --> 02:19:19,628
Shall I tell her
that she can't talk to him?

1804
02:19:20,017 --> 02:19:21,207
Give him the phone.

1805
02:19:22,222 --> 02:19:25,099
Wait! Brother, you had said
that we mustn't talk to girls.

1806
02:19:25,179 --> 02:19:26,870
I say, give him the phone!

1807
02:19:28,935 --> 02:19:31,038
Hello! Hello!

1808
02:19:31,281 --> 02:19:32,676
Yes, it's me.

1809
02:19:33,854 --> 02:19:35,886
But I have
some important work here.

1810
02:19:36,469 --> 02:19:37,612
What's she saying?

1811
02:19:37,692 --> 02:19:41,115
She says that she has important
work and wants me to come there.

1812
02:19:41,195 --> 02:19:43,050
You can't go, Mannu!

1813
02:19:43,130 --> 02:19:46,293
Why can't he go?! He will go!

1814
02:19:46,634 --> 02:19:48,431
May I go?
- Yes.

1815
02:19:51,487 --> 02:19:55,108
Hello. I'm coming. Wait for me.

1816
02:19:58,698 --> 02:20:00,307
You're gone. Where do I go?

1817
02:20:01,909 --> 02:20:03,970
Then what happened?
- I stopped my car.

1818
02:20:04,050 --> 02:20:08,078
I disguised myself and went back
to check. What I saw, shocked me!

1819
02:20:08,158 --> 02:20:10,370
Renu and the motor mechanic
were in the car!

1820
02:20:10,450 --> 02:20:11,947
Renu and that boy?
- Yes.

1821
02:20:12,027 --> 02:20:14,784
But why were they following you?
- That's what I don't understand.

1822
02:20:14,864 --> 02:20:17,931
They must have had some doubt.
What could be the reason?

1823
02:20:18,363 --> 02:20:19,920
Anyway, we must stay alert.

1824
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,742
Boss! It's the same car.

1825
02:20:27,640 --> 02:20:31,618
So they've reached even here.
It means, they're following you.

1826
02:20:32,072 --> 02:20:36,381
Prakash, go to the
house in Versova.

1827
02:20:36,461 --> 02:20:39,452
I'll make some phone calls
and join you soon.

1828
02:20:40,753 --> 02:20:42,590
And let them follow you.

1829
02:20:42,670 --> 02:20:43,811
Okay boss.

1830
02:20:47,466 --> 02:20:50,959
It's been so long! Neither is
anyone going in nor coming out!

1831
02:20:51,347 --> 02:20:53,962
I think they must be
doing their work at night.

1832
02:20:54,331 --> 02:20:56,162
And sleeping till late
in the morning.

1833
02:20:56,505 --> 02:21:00,271
You reached home late last night.
Did your elder brother scold you?

1834
02:21:00,351 --> 02:21:02,431
Yes.
- What did he say?

1835
02:21:02,511 --> 02:21:03,978
No, he didn't say a thing.

1836
02:21:04,058 --> 02:21:06,817
He didn't scold you? Not at all?
- No.

1837
02:21:06,897 --> 02:21:11,548
I was sure your brother would be
furious that you'd returned late.

1838
02:21:11,628 --> 02:21:15,379
Nothing happened. I went home,
ate well and went to sleep.

1839
02:21:15,459 --> 02:21:16,981
Really?
- Yes.

1840
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:21,746
In that case, your brother is not
how you describe him to be.

1841
02:21:21,826 --> 02:21:24,953
Have you seen a coconut?
- Yes, I have.

1842
02:21:25,033 --> 02:21:27,158
My brother is
just like a coconut.

1843
02:21:27,238 --> 02:21:30,003
Hard from outside,
soft from within.

1844
02:21:30,904 --> 02:21:32,802
A car is coming.
Stay alert.

1845
02:22:54,521 --> 02:22:56,099
Renu
- Yes?

1846
02:22:56,953 --> 02:22:58,425
Renu
- Yes?

1847
02:22:59,300 --> 02:23:00,549
Renu!

1848
02:23:00,629 --> 02:23:03,815
Are you nervous once again?
- No, I'm not. What do we do now?

1849
02:23:03,895 --> 02:23:06,701
Let's go in. We'll get
more information from inside.

1850
02:23:06,781 --> 02:23:08,323
Fine, but...

1851
02:23:08,403 --> 02:23:13,128
He opened the lock and went in.
So it's obvious that he's alone.

1852
02:23:13,208 --> 02:23:15,506
But, Renu...
- Are you so scared?

1853
02:23:15,586 --> 02:23:18,268
I'm not afraid for myself
but for you!

1854
02:23:18,348 --> 02:23:21,084
He's alone, and we are two of us.
Let's go. - Okay.

1855
02:23:58,597 --> 02:24:02,156
Renu, this place looks haunted.

1856
02:24:02,236 --> 02:24:05,351
It does seem
as though nobody lives here.

1857
02:24:07,215 --> 02:24:09,356
Then where did that man go?
- Where did he go?

1858
02:24:11,831 --> 02:24:12,958
What's happening?

1859
02:24:14,199 --> 02:24:16,685
It seems as if
somebody is walking upstairs.

1860
02:24:17,701 --> 02:24:19,503
What do we do now?
- Let's go there.

1861
02:24:23,117 --> 02:24:28,479
Leave us.
- Leave us.

1862
02:24:28,728 --> 02:24:31,970
Take them upstairs
and tie them up firmly!

1863
02:24:32,050 --> 02:24:33,847
Leave us!

1864
02:24:36,683 --> 02:24:39,694
Brother Jaggu! Help us!

1865
02:24:39,774 --> 02:24:42,391
Brother Jaggu! Help!

1866
02:24:43,148 --> 02:24:46,543
Help!
- Help!

1867
02:24:53,442 --> 02:24:54,415
Hello boss!

1868
02:24:54,495 --> 02:24:56,317
Good luck Prakash.
- All the best, sir.

1869
02:24:56,845 --> 02:24:59,234
I have had both of them
tied in the room upstairs.

1870
02:24:59,314 --> 02:25:01,714
Good! Did anybody follow you?

1871
02:25:04,069 --> 02:25:05,723
Prakash.
- Yes?

1872
02:25:05,803 --> 02:25:08,243
Will you get married?
- To Renu?!

1873
02:25:08,323 --> 02:25:11,224
Right now?
- I am ready.

1874
02:25:11,788 --> 02:25:16,421
Fetch the registrar. And yes,
we'll need Mr. Kishanchand too.

1875
02:25:16,501 --> 02:25:21,084
Anyway, I'll call him.
Leave now, while I go and talk to them.

1876
02:25:21,441 --> 02:25:22,620
Okay boss.

1877
02:25:41,496 --> 02:25:43,712
I hope you were
looked after properly?

1878
02:25:43,792 --> 02:25:45,259
Yes, we were.

1879
02:25:46,018 --> 02:25:48,340
Hey, I've seen you somewhere!

1880
02:25:50,846 --> 02:25:53,642
Renu! Why did you need
to disguise yourself?

1881
02:25:55,751 --> 02:25:57,765
Oh! I understand.

1882
02:25:58,560 --> 02:26:00,892
You like the prince
so much that you can't stay...

1883
02:26:00,972 --> 02:26:02,842
I hate the very sight of him!

1884
02:26:02,922 --> 02:26:05,383
But how can that be?
You will be getting married to him.

1885
02:26:05,463 --> 02:26:08,307
She has no intentions of
getting married to a murderer!

1886
02:26:09,082 --> 02:26:11,012
Murderer? What do you mean?

1887
02:26:11,092 --> 02:26:12,604
Your brother is a murderer!
- Mohan!

1888
02:26:12,684 --> 02:26:14,368
Who says so?
- I say so.

1889
02:26:17,018 --> 02:26:18,215
Who's he?

1890
02:26:21,135 --> 02:26:24,796
Oh! So, he is your lover?

1891
02:26:24,876 --> 02:26:25,771
Shut up!

1892
02:26:26,657 --> 02:26:29,695
Don't laugh. I can take
your brother to the gallows!

1893
02:26:31,688 --> 02:26:32,424
How is that?

1894
02:26:32,504 --> 02:26:35,008
I saw him dumping
Lalchand's dead body out of the car.

1895
02:26:35,088 --> 02:26:35,956
Mohan!

1896
02:26:37,644 --> 02:26:38,654
Mohan.

1897
02:26:40,570 --> 02:26:42,258
Your life is over now.

1898
02:26:42,338 --> 02:26:46,915
No! Spare him! I promise,
he won't say a word to anyone!

1899
02:26:46,995 --> 02:26:49,441
Renu!
- Quiet! Please!

1900
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:55,659
If you want to save his life,
then marry Prakash.

1901
02:26:56,221 --> 02:26:58,915
What! Never!

1902
02:26:58,995 --> 02:27:02,129
I'd consider it better to die
than to marry that wretched man!

1903
02:27:02,209 --> 02:27:04,764
Correct! Don't bother
about his threats!

1904
02:27:06,770 --> 02:27:09,339
You will get married
to Prakash tonight itself.

1905
02:27:09,959 --> 02:27:12,649
And if you don't agree,
you will be coerced into it.

1906
02:27:12,968 --> 02:27:15,767
I give you 15 minutes to think.

1907
02:27:15,847 --> 02:27:17,552
By then, even your father
will be here.

1908
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:19,181
My father?
- Yes.

1909
02:27:19,454 --> 02:27:22,150
He will come here
to bless the couple.

1910
02:27:23,582 --> 02:27:24,786
Understand?

1911
02:27:27,519 --> 02:27:28,668
Wretched man!

1912
02:27:28,997 --> 02:27:30,646
Now what?

1913
02:27:30,726 --> 02:27:32,453
That rogue won't spare me alive!

1914
02:27:32,533 --> 02:27:36,494
Please don't say that.
You've got into trouble because of me.

1915
02:27:36,574 --> 02:27:38,371
No, Renu. It's my fault.

1916
02:27:38,795 --> 02:27:41,494
If I hadn't let you come here,
we wouldn't have got into trouble.

1917
02:27:41,574 --> 02:27:44,577
Mohan, is there no way
we can escape from here?

1918
02:27:45,076 --> 02:27:47,174
No, we can't.
- We can't?

1919
02:27:48,743 --> 02:27:50,179
What are you thinking of?

1920
02:27:50,674 --> 02:27:55,531
If we are destined to die,
then let's die together.

1921
02:27:55,863 --> 02:27:57,585
But why do you want to die?

1922
02:27:58,250 --> 02:27:59,960
What will I do
living without you?

1923
02:28:00,495 --> 02:28:03,396
Without me?
I don't quite understand, Renu.

1924
02:28:03,967 --> 02:28:06,886
I'd thought you do understand.

1925
02:28:07,391 --> 02:28:09,596
I often thought of telling you.

1926
02:28:10,733 --> 02:28:12,262
But I couldn't!

1927
02:28:12,732 --> 02:28:14,787
And you are saying now
when we are going to die.

1928
02:28:14,867 --> 02:28:15,811
Mannu.

1929
02:28:17,022 --> 02:28:18,281
Renu.
- Yes?

1930
02:28:19,319 --> 02:28:21,074
I don't want to die now.

1931
02:28:33,461 --> 02:28:37,225
It's easy to get trapped
but very difficult to escape.

1932
02:28:39,016 --> 02:28:41,050
Who are you?
- Me?

1933
02:28:41,707 --> 02:28:44,856
Like you, I too have been trapped
in the clutches of these demons!

1934
02:28:45,195 --> 02:28:48,029
How?
- What's the use of hearing it?

1935
02:28:48,109 --> 02:28:52,239
It's a very long story.
But who are you?

1936
02:28:53,948 --> 02:28:57,068
I am Mr. Kishanchand's daughter Renu.

1937
02:28:57,400 --> 02:28:59,088
You're the only child, right?

1938
02:28:59,168 --> 02:29:04,333
Yes. Help us. This cruel man is
forcing me to marry his brother.

1939
02:29:04,559 --> 02:29:05,655
Marry?

1940
02:29:06,035 --> 02:29:07,178
I understand.

1941
02:29:07,731 --> 02:29:12,261
He was successful once.
And he's playing the same trick again.

1942
02:29:12,795 --> 02:29:14,263
I have seen you somewhere.

1943
02:29:14,642 --> 02:29:16,945
Me? Where?

1944
02:29:18,897 --> 02:29:20,968
I don't remember.

1945
02:29:23,268 --> 02:29:25,069
But I have surely seen you.

1946
02:29:25,282 --> 02:29:26,472
Surely?

1947
02:29:30,692 --> 02:29:33,487
Nobody has seen me
since the last 10 years.

1948
02:29:34,414 --> 02:29:36,888
I have been in captivity
since 10 years.

1949
02:29:37,264 --> 02:29:41,069
Since 10 years,
no one ever heard my pleas.

1950
02:29:42,266 --> 02:29:44,498
And you claim
that you have seen me?

1951
02:29:47,076 --> 02:29:48,496
You are crazy!

1952
02:29:48,803 --> 02:29:52,527
I remembered! The picture!
Mannu, the picture!

1953
02:29:52,607 --> 02:29:55,075
She resembles the woman in it!
- Which picture?

1954
02:29:55,289 --> 02:29:58,509
The picture that I'd found under
your brother Brijmohan's pillow.

1955
02:30:00,396 --> 02:30:01,205
Brijmohan!

1956
02:30:02,520 --> 02:30:04,941
Do you know him?
- He is his younger brother.

1957
02:30:05,806 --> 02:30:07,086
Are you his brother?

1958
02:30:07,681 --> 02:30:11,720
Yes, you do look like him.
Where is he?

1959
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:13,152
Mohan's Garage. Queen's Road.

1960
02:30:13,232 --> 02:30:14,383
Mohan's Garage. Queen's Road.

1961
02:30:14,463 --> 02:30:16,652
Help us. Please release us.

1962
02:30:17,088 --> 02:30:19,045
All right, I'll untie you.

1963
02:30:30,041 --> 02:30:31,604
I think someone is coming.

1964
02:30:32,164 --> 02:30:35,538
Don't worry. The moment I get a chance,
I'll come to untie you.

1965
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:40,338
Come.

1966
02:31:43,234 --> 02:31:44,580
This way, please.

1967
02:31:48,122 --> 02:31:49,216
Upstairs.

1968
02:32:00,972 --> 02:32:03,636
Welcome!
- You here?

1969
02:32:03,716 --> 02:32:06,306
How's Renu?
- She is fine.

1970
02:32:06,513 --> 02:32:08,535
But which hospital is this?

1971
02:32:08,615 --> 02:32:10,457
This is a house, not a hospital.

1972
02:32:10,789 --> 02:32:13,899
But they told me that Renu
had met with a car accident.

1973
02:32:13,979 --> 02:32:15,093
And that she is in hospital.

1974
02:32:15,173 --> 02:32:17,645
Please sit down.
There's no need to worry.

1975
02:32:17,725 --> 02:32:22,052
But I don't understand why they
brought me here like this.

1976
02:32:22,453 --> 02:32:26,778
We thought your presence was
needed on this joyous occasion.

1977
02:32:26,858 --> 02:32:29,441
Joyous occasion?
What are you talking about?

1978
02:32:29,521 --> 02:32:31,954
I am getting Prakash
married to Renu.

1979
02:32:32,034 --> 02:32:34,540
What! How can that be possible?

1980
02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:38,117
I'm sorry but we were
forced to rush things up.

1981
02:32:38,197 --> 02:32:39,701
I have called the magistrate.

1982
02:32:39,781 --> 02:32:43,424
But I still don't know
what is Renu's wish!

1983
02:32:43,624 --> 02:32:47,600
I do. And I also know that
you cannot live without her.

1984
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:50,671
Therefore, I've made arrangements
for you to live with Renu.

1985
02:32:50,751 --> 02:32:54,622
What's happening? Where is Renu?!

1986
02:32:54,702 --> 02:32:56,123
Renu?
- Yes.

1987
02:32:56,331 --> 02:32:57,445
Bring Renu.

1988
02:32:58,337 --> 02:33:01,631
She'll be here soon.
You are our guest.

1989
02:33:01,711 --> 02:33:04,247
You will be looked after properly.

1990
02:33:04,327 --> 02:33:06,745
You will only have to
take a little trouble.

1991
02:33:07,043 --> 02:33:08,884
You can't leave from here.

1992
02:33:09,493 --> 02:33:12,357
That's no big deal.
You'll get used to it in a few days.

1993
02:33:12,668 --> 02:33:14,461
Please be seated.

1994
02:33:16,322 --> 02:33:19,533
Excuse me! Is Brijmohan here?

1995
02:33:19,613 --> 02:33:23,096
Yes, he is working.
Can I help you?

1996
02:33:23,332 --> 02:33:27,455
Could you please call him?
Do hurry. It's urgent.

1997
02:33:27,535 --> 02:33:28,797
All right.

1998
02:33:29,059 --> 02:33:30,845
Brother!

1999
02:33:31,240 --> 02:33:33,439
What's the matter, Jaggu?
Any news about Mannu?

2000
02:33:53,442 --> 02:33:54,501
Did you recognise me?

2001
02:33:56,942 --> 02:33:58,409
After 10 years...

2002
02:33:58,782 --> 02:34:03,142
You must have never thought
that you'd see me in this state.

2003
02:34:03,854 --> 02:34:08,158
You must have never even thought
how I spent these 10 years.

2004
02:34:08,829 --> 02:34:11,720
Well, never mind.
Come with me quickly.

2005
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:15,162
With you?
- I'm not saying this for myself.

2006
02:34:15,242 --> 02:34:16,958
Your brother is in danger.

2007
02:34:17,290 --> 02:34:19,234
Manmohan?
What's happened to him?

2008
02:34:19,545 --> 02:34:21,794
There's no time to answer. Hurry!

2009
02:34:21,874 --> 02:34:23,219
Get the car.

2010
02:34:23,299 --> 02:34:24,790
Renu.
- Daddy.

2011
02:34:24,870 --> 02:34:25,932
My dear!

2012
02:34:26,541 --> 02:34:27,582
Daddy.

2013
02:34:27,662 --> 02:34:31,814
These goons brought you too here?
- Yes, my child. Don't worry.

2014
02:34:31,894 --> 02:34:34,387
Daddy, they are rogues
and very dangerous!

2015
02:34:34,467 --> 02:34:36,041
Yes, now I know that too.

2016
02:34:36,121 --> 02:34:38,228
But it's no use now.

2017
02:34:38,308 --> 02:34:41,044
It will be in your good
to get Renu married to Prakash.

2018
02:34:41,124 --> 02:34:46,372
Never! I will never let
my child marry a scoundrel!

2019
02:34:46,452 --> 02:34:49,968
If you love Renu, you'll surely
let the wedding take place.

2020
02:34:50,048 --> 02:34:51,179
Never!

2021
02:34:51,259 --> 02:34:54,176
Good girls don't go against
the wishes of their fathers.

2022
02:34:54,404 --> 02:34:55,346
Your father is going
to get you married.

2023
02:34:55,426 --> 02:34:59,887
Never! I won't get my daughter
married without her consent!

2024
02:35:00,247 --> 02:35:01,727
You won't?
- No!

2025
02:35:04,198 --> 02:35:05,395
Daddy! Daddy!

2026
02:35:05,475 --> 02:35:07,125
Leave my daddy!

2027
02:35:07,205 --> 02:35:09,479
Leave my daddy!

2028
02:35:09,559 --> 02:35:11,497
I say, leave him!

2029
02:35:11,577 --> 02:35:13,453
Say yes!
- Don't, Renu!

2030
02:35:14,697 --> 02:35:18,567
Leave him!
- Don't, Renu! Certainly don't!

2031
02:35:20,384 --> 02:35:22,989
Two gallons of petrol, please.
- Yes, madam.

2032
02:35:27,519 --> 02:35:30,420
Two gallons of petrol. Hurry!
- Coming, sir.

2033
02:35:30,881 --> 02:35:32,978
I've understood
everything, Kamini.

2034
02:35:33,531 --> 02:35:39,135
And today, after 10 years,
I'm glad that I was wrong about you.

2035
02:35:41,228 --> 02:35:43,122
Hurry up.
- Yes sir.

2036
02:35:48,164 --> 02:35:49,236
You?

2037
02:35:53,491 --> 02:35:55,532
What happened?

2038
02:36:33,121 --> 02:36:34,098
Rustom.

2039
02:36:42,635 --> 02:36:46,181
I'll count three and
give you time to think.

2040
02:36:46,346 --> 02:36:51,586
The answer should be positive or
a bullet will be fired... there.

2041
02:36:53,628 --> 02:36:54,631
Start thinking.

2042
02:37:08,532 --> 02:37:09,657
One!

2043
02:37:14,586 --> 02:37:17,855
Two!
- Wait! Say yes, my child.

2044
02:37:17,935 --> 02:37:20,509
Or this poor boy will
unnecessarily lose his life.

2045
02:37:20,589 --> 02:37:22,550
Don't, Renu! Don't!

2046
02:37:23,754 --> 02:37:25,985
Don't, Renu!
- Yes!

2047
02:37:27,153 --> 02:37:28,745
Very good!

2048
02:37:31,175 --> 02:37:32,498
Take him over there.

2049
02:37:47,669 --> 02:37:50,430
Stop crying now
and listen to me carefully.

2050
02:37:50,863 --> 02:37:56,165
Some documents are coming.
Quietly sign that documents.

2051
02:37:56,484 --> 02:37:57,965
Or this poor boy..

2052
02:37:59,165 --> 02:38:00,473
..will be killed.

2053
02:38:00,553 --> 02:38:01,586
Mannu.

2054
02:38:02,732 --> 02:38:04,376
Brother!
- Beware!

2055
02:38:42,872 --> 02:38:44,028
Stop!

2056
02:38:46,374 --> 02:38:47,769
Come on!

2057
02:38:49,023 --> 02:38:52,115
Hail Lord Hanuman!

2058
02:39:28,344 --> 02:39:29,652
Damn you!

2059
02:39:44,468 --> 02:39:48,074
Mannu, it's me!

2060
02:39:48,154 --> 02:39:49,863
Where am I?
- Mannu!

2061
02:40:15,440 --> 02:40:16,769
You betrayed me!

2062
02:40:18,219 --> 02:40:19,582
You cheat!

2063
02:40:19,851 --> 02:40:23,235
No! Don't!
- No?

2064
02:40:42,572 --> 02:40:43,717
Careful!

2065
02:40:49,533 --> 02:40:50,776
Stop!

2066
02:41:18,335 --> 02:41:22,184
Now who will save you?
- Brother! Let's run!

2067
02:41:51,917 --> 02:41:54,554
Sit down, and stop screaming.

2068
02:41:54,846 --> 02:41:56,884
Let me put some iodine.
It will be all right.

2069
02:41:56,964 --> 02:41:58,907
O' God! What a nasty cut!

2070
02:41:58,987 --> 02:42:00,381
It's all because of you.

2071
02:42:00,461 --> 02:42:03,711
First, you hurt me and then
soothe it with iodine. Let go!

2072
02:42:05,244 --> 02:42:06,559
I am dead!

2073
02:42:08,686 --> 02:42:10,697
Sir, can I say something?
- Yes?

2074
02:42:11,610 --> 02:42:15,387
I think Mannu and Renu shouldn't be
separated. If you don't object...

2075
02:42:15,467 --> 02:42:19,426
If they're willing, no one can stop
the bride and groom from being one!

2076
02:42:19,506 --> 02:42:21,790
Why should I object?
- That's right.

2077
02:42:21,870 --> 02:42:25,067
Brother, what about me?

2078
02:42:25,543 --> 02:42:26,868
What happened to you?

2079
02:42:27,126 --> 02:42:30,280
You've got your love.
Mannu too has found his love.

2080
02:42:30,360 --> 02:42:32,073
What about me?

2081
02:42:36,976 --> 02:42:38,299
Ask her.

2082
02:42:39,752 --> 02:42:45,520
Listen... brother wants to know
if you will... marry me.

2083
02:42:46,290 --> 02:42:49,722
If you don't marry me, I'll be
left alone. Don't leave me alone.

2084
02:42:49,802 --> 02:42:53,077
Tell brother and everyone
that you love me.

2085
02:42:53,157 --> 02:42:54,269
Stop it!

2086
02:42:55,242 --> 02:42:56,615
She says, stop it!

2087
02:42:56,695 --> 02:42:58,272
It means yes.

2088
02:42:58,839 --> 02:43:00,708
Yes? Come on!

2089
02:43:01,071 --> 02:43:02,609
Hey, leave me!
- I won't!

2090
02:43:02,689 --> 02:43:05,753
Shameless boy! You hold a
girl's hand in front of me?

2091
02:43:07,065 --> 02:43:08,455
Have you decided?
- Yes.

2092
02:43:08,673 --> 02:43:10,453
Are you happy?
- Yes, I am.

2093
02:43:10,533 --> 02:43:12,180
Then let's go home.
- Really?

2094
02:43:12,260 --> 02:43:14,546
May I bring her along?
- Yes, you may.

2095
02:43:14,626 --> 02:43:15,679
Come on.

2096
02:43:18,369 --> 02:43:20,851
That's enough, my son.
Go, my dear.

2097
02:43:29,190 --> 02:43:32,572
"Always stay together like this."

2098
02:43:32,652 --> 02:43:36,718
"United we stand,
Divided we fall."

2099
02:43:36,967 --> 02:43:40,546
"If problems are strewn your way
with a brave face, challenge it."

2100
02:43:40,626 --> 02:43:44,362
"If huge hurdles block your way,
together move it aside."

2101
02:43:44,442 --> 02:43:48,037
"The one who fathoms this
achieves success."

2102
02:43:48,117 --> 02:43:51,064
"The one who fathoms this
achieves success."

2103
02:43:51,144 --> 02:43:53,064
"Move aside."

2104
02:43:53,144 --> 02:43:59,561
"The honk hoots aloud
so move aside."

2105
02:43:59,641 --> 02:44:05,247
"What's mobile here is called a car."

2106
02:44:05,327 --> 02:44:10,977
"The honk hoots aloud
so move aside."

2107
02:44:11,057 --> 02:44:15,628
"What's mobile here is called a car."
