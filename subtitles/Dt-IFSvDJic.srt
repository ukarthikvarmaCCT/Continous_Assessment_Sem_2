1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,220
- Have you ever wondered
how paper is made?

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,053
- No.

3
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:04,500
- Goldfish, the foods you eat?

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,333
- Okay, yeah.

5
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:07,380
- Perfect, 'cause we're gonna
answer all that in this video.

6
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,060
How water bottles are made.

7
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,680
- That doesn't it look
like a water bottle?

8
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,760
- Oh, all right.

9
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,800
You just squeeze it with
metal and then it inflates.

10
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,570
They all probably come like that,

11
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,130
so that way they can have different shapes

12
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,150
for different bottles.

13
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,640
And they inflate it to
the bottle they want.

14
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,200
So that way you can buy a ton of them,

15
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,790
and make different
bottles in the factories.

16
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,040
- Oh, really, that
actually does make sense.

17
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,470
- And that is all just
speculation from me,

18
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,360
that could be totally
false, but who cares?

19
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,260
This is our channel.

20
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,790

21
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,230
- Do you like ice cream sandwiches?

22
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,370
- Literally who doesn't?

23
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,960
- The ice cream could be better,

24
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,090
if they used higher quality
ice cream in the middle,

25
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:39,923
it'd be better.

26
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:41,700
- Just buy high quality
ice cream sandwiches,

27
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,200
stop buying the 50 cent ones.

28
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,340
- I go to Walmart, okay?

29
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,800
They don't got high quality
ice cream sandwiches,

30
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,030
it's great value or nothing.

31
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,010
- Yo, someone make a high quality version

32
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,850
of ice cream sandwiches.

33
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,710
- Who's one of the big
ice cream companies?

34
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,640
- Do you think I just search

35
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,020
ice cream companies in my free time?

36
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,334
- Bro, you don't be searching
into ice cream lure bro?

37
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:58,167
- No.

38
00:00:58,167 --> 00:00:59,610

39
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,140

that get stuck in your
nose when you're little.

41
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,163
Just me?

42
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:05,520
I got one of those heads stuck in my nose,

43
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,320
and I had to go to the
doctor to get it taken out.

44
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,090
I really hope Tucker isn't like me,

45
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,010
'cause I was just very problematic

46
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,843
for a child.
- Weirdo.

47
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:13,410
How instant ramen are made.

48
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,870
This ramen factory runs 24 hours a day.

49
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,980
Oh, is that spicy ramen?

50
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,360
- Ooh, I love the spicy ramen.

51
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,650
- Bro, imagine just grabbing that,

52
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,180
and just being able to eat
off that conveyor belt.

53
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,320
- Just hot off the press.

54
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
Have you ever eat ramen uncooked?

55
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,073
- No.

56
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:26,340
- You haven't ever just
sprinkled the stuff on it,

57
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,173
and then just eat it?

58
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:28,860
- No.
- Okay, I guess...

59
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,420
All right, I grew up poor, okay?

60
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,250
- I didn't even know that was possible.

61
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,954
- You just sprinkle the season and on it

62
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:35,040
and then you eat it.

63
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,060
- It probably tastes like brick dust.

64
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,920
- It's kind of crunchy
but it's not that bad.

This is for the one billionaire
that watches our videos.

69
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,080
The rest of you that aren't
that one billionaire,

70
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,913
don't worry about it.

71
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:49,680
Even if I had $20,000,000
to spend on a boat

72
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,520
I don't think I would.

73
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,720
- This is why I got a Hundo.

74
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,850
- Nah, yachts aren't as much as you think.

75
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,235
- Jeffrey Bezos spent 500 million on it.

76
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:59,820
- Yeah, Jeffrey Bezos also owns the world.

77
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,216
He owns a couple of like oil tycoon.

78
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:04,020
- Oh, a couple of oil tycoon.

79
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,853
Yeah, you're right,

80
00:02:04,853 --> 00:02:06,300
that's probably like a 15 million boat.

81
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,700
Now we're gonna react to
how play buttons are made.

82
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,530
- You would know you have 30 of them.

83
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,060
- Actually we have 35 now.

84
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,550
- YouTube pays this company to do this.

85
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,560
- Bro, YouTube makes
billions upon billions

86
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,490
of dollars a day,

87
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,840
do you think they care to make this?

88
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,860
- Yeah that's true.

89
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,450
- Do you think they care
about a couple of grand?

90
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,860
How to move a spaceship.

91
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,516
- This is over the
course of multiple hours.

92
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:27,270
- I thought you were about
to say multiple days,

93
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,550
I was like bro, it's
been dark the whole time.

94
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,620
- Oh well look at that,
now it's a course of a day

95
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,570
because now it's completely daytime.

96
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,730
Even though I didn't say
that, I was still right.

97
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,930
Why didn't they just build it there?

98
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,770
- Because there's a difference between

99
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,540
a manufacturing plant and a launched pad?

100
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,130
- What a bunch of idiots,

101
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,840
why didn't they just build it there

102
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,070
so they didn't have to move it?

103
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,720
- Yo honestly, don't
you want a new iPhone?

104
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,830
Just build it in your house.

105
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,870
- Look at it, it's like, "Ah."

106
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,920
Hey, that's going to space.

107
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,090
- It went to space.

108
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,923
- Good for it.

109
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:53,910
- All right, so this is how
they make speed limit sign.

110
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,743
- Nice.

111
00:02:54,743 --> 00:02:56,970
- Wait, have you ever seen
a 69 speed limit sign?

112
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,310
- No, this is a guy who
makes them and sells them,

113
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,690
I've seen him on TikTok before.

114
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,680
- Oh that's lame.

115
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,720
I wanna know how the
government literally makes

116
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,670
millions upon millions
of sign across America.

117
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,650
- Jimmy, when I worked IT,

118
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,890
I actually had to work on the
computer that makes the sign

119
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,540
and it is actually just like this.

120
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,390
This guy just bought or has
one, but that's so cool,

121
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,700
he can make them say
whatever he wants Jimmy.

122
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,200
And they're like legit signs too.

123
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,460
- So I don't have to keep stealing them?

124
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,260
- Jimmy, don't say that, that's a felony,

125
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,670
I found that out the hard way.

126
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,470
- How Goldfish arm made.

127
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,820
- What the freak is that?

128
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,893
Oh that's cheese, oh my
god, it's so much cheese.

129
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:29,726
- Oh wait, really?

130
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,770
- Yeah, I forgot Goldfish
are just cheese bread.

131
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,850
- Oh my gosh.

132
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,683
Wait, those don't look like goldfish,

133
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:35,520
those look like gold catfish.

134
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,900
- They look like gold flats.

135
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,460
- They look like gold wide fish.

136
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,293
Wait, that's it?

137
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:41,490
You just take cheese,
and cut it, and burn it.

138
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,700
- I need to know more, how
deep does this hole go?

139
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,290
- We should start a goldfish plant,

140
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,400
they don't look how hard to make.

141
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,990
Let's just do Jimmy fish,

142
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,540
and it's just like Goldfish
just slightly crispier.

143
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,380
- Yeah, let's do it.

144
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,340
- How pencils are made.

145
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,900
- Tell you what, there wasn't enough made

146
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,760
in middle school when I was a kid.

147
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,430
And you gotta ask the girl
beside you to borrow her pencil,

148
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,450
and she's like, "No,

149
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,610
I gave you a pencil last time
and you didn't give back."

150
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,650
It's like I'ma need a pencil.

151
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,150
- I think they just didn't like you,

152
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,710
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

153
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,570
- Jennifer, you know who you are,

154
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,740
I failed that test.

155
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,970
Not because of the pencil,

156
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,530
because I'm not very smart.

157
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,970
- How to make custom rug.

158
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,287
- Oh, I love these on TikTok.

159
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:18,245
- I'm gonna make a Mr. Beast burger rug.

160
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:20,430
- Oh, a Mr. Beast burger rug.

161
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,410
- Why don't we have it
under our feet right now?

162
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,831
- It looks ugly right now, but the blue--

163
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:24,664
- It does look ugly.

164
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,497
- It doesn't.

165
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:26,340
- You're one of those people that

166
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,540
lie to make people feel good.

167
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,440
- No, I'm one of the people

168
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,050
that can see the diamond in the rough man.

169
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,310
Look how fluffy it looks.

170
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,143
It looks like big bird.

171
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:33,976
- You think that looks good?

172
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:35,092
- I don't think it looks good as a rug.

173
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:35,926
- See, unlike him--

174
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:37,710
- But it looks good to rub my face across.

175
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,180
- Unlike him I won't lie to you,

176
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,470
it looks ugly so far.

177
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,303
We'll keep going though.

178
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:42,420
- This is so much better,

179
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,260
but we have more to go.

180
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,600
- Oh, see now it looks better.

181
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,130
Oh wow, that's pretty cool.

182
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,720
And by the way, if you're
watching this and hungry

183
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,890
go order our beast burger.

184
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,030
Just literally download our app,

185
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,110
or go on Uber Eats, Grubhub,

186
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,370
or on all your favorite delivery apps.

187
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,810
Order one right now, it takes amazing.

188
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,400
How to build a wooden rollercoaster.

189
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,590
And if any of these guys here mess up,

190
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,423
you will die.

191
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:00,330
- The first thing I'm noticing

192
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,730
is a surprising lack of power tools,

193
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,290
and a lot of really old hammers

194
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,293
that are barely held together.

195
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,647
I don't know about this one man,

196
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:09,630
are you trust in your life with that?

197
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,480
- Oh, 100s or 1000s of
people probably did.

198
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,950
- I don't like wooden rollercoasters,

199
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,783
what's the point?

200
00:05:14,783 --> 00:05:16,290
You get the crap beat out of you,

201
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,370
and they're so short,

202
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,810
and they don't even really go that high.

203
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,710
- Yeah, and on top of that,

204
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,570
this thing could light on fire so easily.

205
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,770
- And burn down instantly.

206
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,310
They're like "Yay, we have
concussions and neck trauma now.

207
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,990
Woo, wooden rollercoasters."

208
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,670
- That happens on every rollercoaster.

209
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,503
- No.

210
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:31,336
- Time out.

211
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:32,280
If you haven't already subscribed

212
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,330
hit the subscribe button right now.

213
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,640
We're gonna be giving
$1,000 to a random person

214
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,260
that subscribes in the next seven days.

215
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,940
So if you haven't already
hit the subscribe button

216
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,773
I'll love you.

217
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:40,710
And un-timeout.
- Bew.

218
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,640
- How to make Oreos.

219
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,113
Okay, this has to be good.

220
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,000
- You start with poo poo.

221
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,370
- But wait, that's brown
And Oreos are black.

222
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,290
- Well it's probably when
you bake 'em they turn--

223
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,360
- Whoa, when you bake
your poop it turns black?

224
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,193
- Probably.

225
00:05:52,193 --> 00:05:53,026
- Here's what they should do,

226
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:54,930
they should just take
this and just break it

227
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,370
'cause we just want the
white stuff in the middle.

228
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,330
I think I speak for everyone.

229
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,980
Why don't they do an Oreo where

230
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,380
it's the white stuff is on the outside,

231
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,270
and then there's one
little thin black cookie--

232
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,103
- In the middle?

233
00:06:04,103 --> 00:06:05,147
- Yeah.

234
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:05,980
- Oh, that would be good.

235
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,492
- What if they came out with a new Oreo,

236
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,300
and it's called just the white stuff.

237
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,160
- Can I just buy white stuff cream?

238
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,110
- Yeah, it's not even packaged,

239
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,050
it's just squirted into a Ziploc bag.

240
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,570
- And they need to call
it the white stuff.

241
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,403
- The white stuff.

242
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:20,880
- Yeah, see, no, those aren't good,

243
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,713
look at that.

244
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:24,810
The chocolate to the
white ratio is so off.

245
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,710
- Not on this one though,

246
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,330
this one's thick.
- Yeah, that one is fine.

247
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,670
But like all these other
ones I don't like my Oreos

248
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,990
when there's not much white stuff in them.

249
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,759
- This whole conversation
becomes irrelevant

250
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,920
when you say vanilla Oreos,

251
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,840
because vanilla Oreos are incredible.

252
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,430
- I still would rather eat a vanilla Oreo

253
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,750
without the top than with the top.

254
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,800
- We don't have to agree on everything.

255
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,420
- But we can agree it's
better than chocolate.

256
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,530
- Yes, very good.

257
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,900
I'm glad we discussed this,
we got to this conclusion.

258
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,860
- I wiped my butt with
this hand this morning.

259
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,600
- I also wiped my butt with this hand.

260
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,550
- Perfect .

261
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,476
- Newmans, Newman O's.

262
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:55,149
This aren't Oreos.

263
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,460
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

264
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,780
- Who the heck is Newman?

265
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,330
- Oreo's corporate office,
y'all need to sue Newman,

266
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,820
yo, he put his name on
the package, sue him.

267
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,260
Making of a stream room.

268
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,187
Is this gonna be Ninja's?

269
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:06,290
- This better not be Ninja.

270
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,800
- Wait, is it?

271
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,760
Wait, did I call it?

272
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,780
Oh my God, I called it.

273
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,700
Why does everyone think
of Ninja's stream room

274
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,533
when they think of one.

275
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,860
- Other people have stream rooms.

276
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,720
- Welcome to Ninja dojo.

277
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,010
- To the Ninja dojo.

278
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,690
Why doesn't Carl have a cool stream room?

279
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,970
- Yeah, some company should
make Karl a cool stream room.

280
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,500
- From basketball to hockey arena,

281
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,180
you pick up all the basketball court.

282
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,740
Love how they're just Lego blocks.

283
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,180
Wait, do they just lay down ice?

284
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,550
- Yeah, it's just like Lego blocks of ice.

285
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,620
I never knew that, that's so cool.

286
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,600
Then they also get the Zamboni out,

287
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,330
the Zamboni polishes it
and merges them together.

288
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,040
And I like saying Zamboni.

289
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,154
- Zamboni.

290
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:40,256
- Zamboni.

291
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:41,089
- Zambonith.

292
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:42,600
How to move an entire tree.

293
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
Oh gosh.

294
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,273
- Whoa.

295
00:07:44,273 --> 00:07:45,106
- Wait, wait, wait,

296
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:46,596
they make machines that
can just eat trees?

297
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:49,770
- No, those are gonna scoop the dirt out,

298
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,570
and get all the roots
for the tree and move it.

299
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,500
This is so cool.

300
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,290
- We live in a day and age
where we can move trees.

301
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,250
How to make paper.

302
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,300
- Wait, this is wood.

303
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,000
- If you're a tree watching
this video close your eyes.

304
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,870
- Right now.
- Close your eyes.

305
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,340
I will say turtle when you can open them.

306
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,630
Now that all the trees are gone.

307
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,120
- You tumble wood and then it becomes

308
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,300
this sheet by the
tumbling power obviously.

309
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,880
And then you spin it
for a really long time,

310
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,650
and then it becomes these tubes.

311
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,070
Then these tubes like to
rub up against each other,

312
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,080
and what is going on?

313
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,190
- No idea.

314
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,023
All right.

315
00:08:21,023 --> 00:08:21,856
And boom

316
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:22,689
Changed color.
- And boom, paper.

317
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:23,522
- And now it's paper.

318
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:27,300
- Giant paper, and this is what giants use

319
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,887
to print receipts at CVS.

320
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:30,900
- No, this is what giants
to wipe their butt.

321
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,820
- It looks like receipt
paper, not toilet paper.

322
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,170
- You're telling me that's
not giant toilet paper?

323
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,070
- Okay.
- Checkmate.

324
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,940
- Yeah, you got me there.

325
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,860
- Adidas making the best running shoes.

326
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,090
- Are they these?

327
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,410
Because these are pretty fun to run it.

328
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,790
- That looks like a sack that

329
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,250
back in biblical times
they used to carry coins,

330
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,840
and they just put some foam around it.

331
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,673
Does it not?

332
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:48,720
- What did I do to get
this kind of treatment man?

333
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,220
- You ain't even got shoes on.

334
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,690
- Yeah, no shoe gang.

335
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,730
- Get those concrete grippers outta here.

336
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,930
- I need an explanation.

337
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,910
- Your toes they be gripping concrete

338
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,350
'cause they look like fingers.

339
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,730
- I didn't know shoes were handmade.

340
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,840
- I figured robots did it,

341
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,280
I figured robots did everything.

342
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,800
- Yeah, I'm pretty confident
everything I see in life now

343
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,700
is made by a robot.

344
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,327
- I just assumed that
had already happened,

345
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,160
I don't know anymore.

346
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,270
- Yeah, all right, well
that's interesting,

347
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,830
Nike shoes are made by people.

348
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,600
- Those are Adidas, you idiot.

349
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,433
- What's the difference?

350
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,660
Five years from now when we're
negotiating a sponsorship,

351
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,560
they're gonna be like "You said

352
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,520
there's no difference between us."

353
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,850
- And you're like, to be fair
they are both literally shoes.

354
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,470
- How it's made, smallest car.

355
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,440
- Hey, this is an actual
"How It's Made" clip,

356
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,040
I used to watch this show at 2:00 a.m.

357
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,742
while I ate cheese out of the fridge.

358
00:09:27,742 --> 00:09:28,680
- While you ate cheese outta the fridge?

359
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,150
You should have baked it,
could of had Goldfish?

360
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,430
- You just take one piece of craft single

361
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,720
and fold it in half and then eat.

362
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,670
It tastes better if you fold in half.

363
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,503
- Agreed.

364
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:37,336
- A little car.

365
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:38,730
- Yeah, I bet that's
really fuel efficient.

366
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,440
How to make McDonald's fries.

367
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,700
I'm gonna take notes for Beast Burger.

368
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,440
- The glossiest potatoes,

369
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,260
and then send them
through a freaking cannon

370
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,180
into a wire screen.

371
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,287
- Shoot them through a cannon.

372
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:51,150
- It destroys them at a
million miles per hour.

373
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,060
And then you drop 'em in oil
and put salt all over 'em,

374
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,410
and now they're taking a bath,

375
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,640
they're all hanging out in a pool.

376
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,320
You send them on a conveyor belt,

377
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,420
and then they put 'em in packaging

378
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,580
and then they throw 'em in grease again.

379
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,867
- Got it, Beast Burger has churros now,

380
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,610
now I need to go call
the Beast Burger team.

381
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,443
Thank you for watching.

382
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:07,440
Subscribe if you wanna win money,

383
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,190
- Hopefully we won't get sued, bye.
