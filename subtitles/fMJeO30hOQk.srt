00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,650
Hi guys and welcome to French Guy Cooking.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:10,549
Today : an explosion of indian tangy flavors
trapped in the most reassuring english Tradition,

3
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:11,549
Plus !

4
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:17,640
I'll bring you the most undisputable proof
that you have the power to work miracles.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,810
Let's make the unexpected but stunning Palak
Paneer Hinglish Pie...

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:32,680
You are about to make your own cheese.

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,640
How you feel about it ?

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,360
The Paneer cheese is insanely fast and dead
simple to make.

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,180
Paneer is a fresh cheese quite common in India.

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,150
It is made by curdling heated milk with an
acidic liquid.

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,899
It tastes quite soft, but it is milky and
nutty.

12
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,930
In a big pan over medium high heat, pour 2
liters of whole milk and 1 cup of cream

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,120
Stir it from time to time.

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,950
When there is serious foam forming

15
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,610
Remove the milk form the heat, and add half
a cup of apple cider vinegar.

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,409
This is where things get exciting !

17
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,700
The reaction just takes a few minutes.

18
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,240
The milk will separate into curds and whey.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,720
Now get yourself a piece of cloth.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,740
This can be called a cheesecloth or a muslin.

21
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,080
Just take whatever cloth you find.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,360
Place the cloth in a strainer over the sink.

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,930
Pour the liquid in.

24
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,920
Carefully Make a knot.

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,740
Now put weight on it.

26
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,930
It will squeeze the excess of water out.

27
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,150
The Paneer Cheese will be ready when we need
it.

28
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,530
A good pie is all about a good filling.

29
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,479
For this one, we 'll use Fish and Spinach.

30
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,479
What ?

31
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,100
Do you remember we are trying to gain subscribers
?

32
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,780
Well I do, and thrust me

33
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,650
you won't find any watery spinach or bland
fish in this recipe.

34
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:56,680
Instead, think of outstanding explosive flavors
like mint, ginger, garlic, lemon !

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,080
First things first.

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,470
Let's marinate the fish.

37
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,060
Cut 4 fillets of trout into big chunks.

38
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,470
Season well with salt and pepper, then place
them in a bowl.

39
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,790
Add a Drizzle of oil

40
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,200
A drizzle of honey

41
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,670
A crush of garlic

42
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,239
A gratted thumb of ginger

43
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:15,489
The juice of half a lemon

44
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:18,170
And all the zest you can get from it

45
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,690
A sprinkle of chopped mint leaves can't do
any harm.

46
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,730
Let it rest while we prepare the greens...

47
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,060
From now on, we will use an oven-proof frying
pan.

48
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,650
You can also use a skillet.

49
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,599
Or a frying pan and a pie dish.

50
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,150
Over medium high heat, a big knob of Butter

51
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,870
Add a thumb of gratted ginger

52
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,959
2 crushed cloves of Garlic

53
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,200
Chop 3 onions,

54
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,349
2, 3 minutes should do it.

55
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:50,020
Add loads of fresh spinach and let them fall
down in the frying pan.

56
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,239
Spinach will litteraly vanish in the pan.

57
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,730
So When I say loads, I mean tremendous amounts
of spinach.

58
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,040
Like : "fuck i shouldn't put that much".

59
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,390
A good big pinch of Salt, pinch of pepper.

60
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:08,150
When almost all the water has evaporated,
we can move on to the next step.

61
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,709
Let's build the pie up.

62
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:11,780
Two rolls of puff pastries on the board.

63
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,819
Parchment paper under it.

64
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,140
Heavy Sprinkling with an indian spices mix.

65
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,140
Coriander seeds

66
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,140
Cumin seeds

67
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,140
Nutmeg

68
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,140
Salt

69
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,140
Pepper corn

70
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,879
A bit of cinnamon

71
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,790
Fat is always a good carrier of taste, because
many flavors do not dissolve in water.

72
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,980
In this case we use the fat of the puff pastries
to retain the indian spices.

73
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,310
Thoroughly rub to the puff pastries.

74
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,180
On one roll, sprinkle breadcrumbs.

75
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,800
They will suck out the excess of moisture
during baking.

76
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,140
Spread the onions and the spinach.

77
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,629
Carefully slide it in the same pan we used
earlier.

78
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:49,989
We are baking it in the frying pan for two
reasons :

79
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:52,420
One, It is convinient.

80
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,560
Second, it's unexpected.

81
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,799
People are gonna get curious about it and
even more when they'll discover what's inside.

82
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,000
Next add the drained chunks of fish.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,640
Time to use the paneer cheese.

84
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,280
Unwrap it, slice it and place it on top.

85
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,900
Fold the edges towards the center.

86
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,540
Place the second roll on top, spiced side
down.

87
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,220
Here comes a cool part.

88
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,909
We are forming the pie, not by sealing it,
but by folding it like a bed sheet.

89
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:22,909
why ?

90
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,249
How many pies have you sealed in your life
?

91
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:27,409
And how many beds sheets have you folded ?

92
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:34,539
Gently Push the edges back in the pan, under
the first layer.

93
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:37,020
Prick the pastry so that steam can escape.

94
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,669
And finally, brush the pie with milk.

95
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:40,669
BOOM !

96
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:46,339
In a preheated oven until you achieve a nice
golden brown finish.

97
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:50,219
There we have it : The unexpected Palak Paneer
Hinglish Pie !

98
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:56,530
Outside, the shiny crust is crispy as hell
and encrusted with bold indian flavors.

99
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,840
Inside, it's all about freshness and moisture.

100
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,509
Tell a story : It's no boring pie !

101
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:06,629
it's journey made of warm blankets and dream
countries.

00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:10,909

to have your comments, your likes and your
