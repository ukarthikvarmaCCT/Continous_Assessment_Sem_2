1
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,508
You need to be a little careful.

2
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,425
The law will be enforced any day now..

3
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:51,092
I am not selling my property, Majumdar

4
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,592
Then form a Trust.

5
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:56,800
Even that takes time.

6
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,258
All the other landlords are doing it.

7
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,300
Pakhi..

8
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,217
Pakhi..

9
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:13,467
Where were you lost?

10
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:15,467
How long have you been up?

11
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:18,758
I have been up for ten minutes,

12
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,258
but you were staring into space,

13
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:25,842
moving the fan like a statue.

14
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,175
How are you feeling now?

15
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:30,217
I am feeling fine, thank you.

16
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:33,675
Did it hurt?

17
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:54,008
Did I ever tell you
the Bheel Raja story?

18
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:55,092
No

19
00:04:55,258 --> 00:04:56,883
A long time ago, there lived the..

20
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:59,425
Mighty Raja of the Bheel tribe.

21
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:04,133
No one could ever harm him.

22
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:06,425
Everyone was afraid of him.

23
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:10,925
The English made many
attempts on his life.

24
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:13,675
They cut him with swords,

25
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:15,550
they slit him with a thousand arrows,

26
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:17,842
but he just wouldn't die.

27
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,675
Then they heard that the Raja..

28
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:23,383
Confined his 'life' in a parrot.

29
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:27,550
But there were a thousand
parrots in the forest.

30
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:30,300
Which one would it be?

31
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,425
Then they sent a spy.

32
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:35,842
A beautiful one.

33
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:41,342
The Raja fell in love with her

34
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:48,008
One fine day she found 'the' parrot.

35
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:53,592
She got hold of it and...

36
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:57,842
Then?

37
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,342
Then he died

38
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:06,592
Pakhi, you are my that parrot.

39
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:10,508
If anything happens to you..

40
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:35,258
Stick to the left side.

41
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:38,883
Slowly.

42
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:42,758
We don't want to have an accident.

43
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:45,175
If we get into an
accident then you were driving.

44
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:47,675
If not then I was driving.

45
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:55,425
Watch out!

46
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:02,133
You will get me fired.

47
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:07,758
Watch out

48
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:11,467
.. that motor...

49
00:08:15,758 --> 00:08:16,467
What are you doing?

50
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,550
Shh..

51
00:08:18,342 --> 00:08:19,592
Doctor Uncle

52
00:08:20,842 --> 00:08:22,758
Pakhi, you can go home

53
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,258
He is fine now

54
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:26,883
Ok

55
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:37,967
Move.

56
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:39,508
Why

57
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:43,050
You almost killed
the poor motorcyclist.

58
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:46,008
You don't know how to drive.

59
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:47,842
Me?

60
00:08:49,217 --> 00:08:51,217
Then who? Me?

61
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:34,383
What's wrong?

62
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:38,842
The filament got damaged.

63
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:40,175
Filament?

64
00:09:40,258 --> 00:09:43,842
The thing that lights up.

65
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:45,883
Isn't that electricity?

66
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:50,342
The electricity lights the filament,
the filament lights up the bulb.

67
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:52,758
Oh, yes. I knew that.

68
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:56,467
So whatever it is,
Install it everywhere.

69
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,800
And give the bills to Majumdar.

70
00:10:02,758 --> 00:10:04,133
You aren't being serious.

71
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:10,842
If the Zamindari Abolishment Act is
passed, you will be left with nothing.

72
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:14,342
The Act wont be passed, Majumdar.

73
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:15,342
It will.

74
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:17,443
There aren't any landlords in
government who will support you.

75
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:20,550
Why do our fathers keep arguing?

76
00:10:20,758 --> 00:10:24,675
My father feels that Zamindar
uncle doesn't understand him

77
00:10:24,883 --> 00:10:29,008
and Zamindar uncle feels
that my father keeps yakking.

78
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:31,258
Yakking?

79
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:49,425
Yes?

80
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:51,217
My name is Varun Srivastava

81
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:52,675
Where have you come from?

82
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:56,883
You stay here.

83
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:07,550
Babu, someone has come from Delhi,

84
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:10,467
some 'english' place.

85
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,342
He is an archeologist.

86
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,175
Wants to excavate our temple site

87
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:28,008
He thinks there is an ancient
civilization buried underneath.

88
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,550
So?

89
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,842
He's coming home for dinner tonight

90
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:33,383
Ask him yourself.

91
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:43,883
Varun Shrivastava.

92
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:44,592
Yes?

93
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:45,925
Don't look back

94
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:48,717
The driver who drove into you,

95
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,342
his name is Babu Singh.

96
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:55,717
Ok.

97
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,842
And what is your name?

98
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,383
Don't try to be smart,
because you are not.

99
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:04,425
Ok.

100
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,550
Which one are you?

101
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:09,883
Mr. Srivastava

102
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:12,717
You are very punctual

103
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,550
This is my daughter, Pakhi

104
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:19,842
And Pakhi,
he is that gentleman I told you about.

105
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:21,425
Namaste

106
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,008
She wants to be a writer

107
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:29,133
She's not bad.

108
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:33,050
She has written her name
on all my books.

109
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:36,592
Baba, I am good.

110
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,258
I am sure

111
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,758
So, Archaeologists.

112
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:46,342
I always thought they were old men.

113
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:52,842
Busy amidst the cobwebs
of archaic buildings.

114
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,717
I guess that's why the
name starts with 'Archaic'

115
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:02,008
Where are you staying?

116
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:05,217
At the Circuit House.
Nearby the temple.

117
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,675
What happened to your head?

118
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:11,508
My motorcycle had
an accident with a car.

119
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:12,842
In Manekpur?

120
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:13,925
Yes.

121
00:13:14,217 --> 00:13:15,383
Who was driving?

122
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:16,717
I was driving.

123
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:19,217
If you drive both of
them at the same time..

124
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,592
I was driving the motorcycle.

125
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Coffee?

126
00:13:25,258 --> 00:13:26,258
Yes

127
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:29,467
And some bad amateur
was driving the car.

128
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:34,092
Couldn't spot a motorcycle
on such a wide road

129
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,300
I don't think these
amateurs should be allowed..

130
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,050
Sorry. I'll get some cold water.

131
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:44,342
Sorry about that

132
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:35,967
Baba Nagarjuna.

133
00:14:36,383 --> 00:14:38,217
Real name Vaidyanath Mishra

134
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,133
Lives in Darbhanga, my native village.

135
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,092
Where did you say, you are staying?

136
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:19,967
I'm impressed, Varun Babu.

137
00:15:21,508 --> 00:15:24,675
This mansion instead
of that guest house.

138
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:45,592
Are you understanding anything,
Debdas Mukherjee?

139
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:47,592
I can understand everything.

140
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:49,883
My parents talk exactly like this.

141
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:04,467
Learn Bengali

142
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,300
You'll have to learn one day

143
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:43,258
Have you seen Baazi?

144
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:44,092
No

145
00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:45,633
You should watch it...

146
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:47,717
Now that's what you call a movie.

147
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,467
Dev Anand plays a gambler.

148
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:52,967
And a moment comes
when he has to choose.

149
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,133
A hell lot of money
or his sister's life.

150
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:57,842
Or he has to quit everything,
for his love.

151
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:00,592
He's an amazing actor.

152
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:02,800
And an even better fighter.

153
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,008
You want to see how he fights?

154
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,633
Like this, while swaying..

155
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:09,842
No matter how many goons attack him

156
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:12,633
they will not spoil his hairstyle.

157
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:18,633
These ruins have remained

158
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:20,758
untouched for the
last five hundred years.

159
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:25,092
Nobody is allowed to build
or demolish anything here.

160
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:27,675
This famous Radha-Krishna idol is..

161
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:30,175
..the legacy of my
Roy Chouhdry ancestry.

162
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,592
Its at least three hundred years old.

163
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:37,717
This..

164
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,383
This is where we start excavating.

165
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:43,467
And we can put up the camp here.

166
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:46,425
We would need some labourers.

167
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:47,342
Definitely

168
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:50,633
So this is where we dig

169
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:51,217
Do what?

170
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,300
Digging

171
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:53,342
Good

172
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:57,175
Now, do you guys know how to dig?

173
00:17:59,092 --> 00:18:03,717
What have we got all this for?

174
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:04,967
Very good

175
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,008
But why are we going to dig?

176
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,633
Well.. because this is land and..

177
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,342
News from the capital.

178
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:24,342
In a historic decision today
the government of India..

179
00:19:24,425 --> 00:19:26,800
..announced the
Zamindari Abolition Act.

180
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:29,550
One of the prominent lawyers
from the High Court..

181
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:31,883
Mr. Rao added that
according to this Act..

182
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,758
The Landlords will be allowed no more
than fifteen acres for themselves.

183
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,383
Will they seize the orchard?

184
00:19:42,592 --> 00:19:43,592
Yes.

185
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,467
What will they do with it?

186
00:19:49,383 --> 00:19:51,300
Divide it amongst the villagers..

187
00:19:51,842 --> 00:19:54,092
Free fruits for all.

188
00:19:56,258 --> 00:20:02,300
My stomach is growling.

189
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,258
No one eats before
the first fish is caught.

190
00:20:07,258 --> 00:20:08,300
Tradition, you see.

191
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:10,092
Of course.

192
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:31,842
You are looking in the
wrong direction, Varun babu.

193
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:34,342
Are you mad?

194
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,633
I was just looking.

195
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,925
I saw how you were 'looking'

196
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:40,008
How was i looking?

197
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:43,008
Its that 'look'

198
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:45,800
Things happen.

199
00:20:45,883 --> 00:20:46,967
Nothing happens

200
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,342
your hunger has gone to the brain.

201
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:51,258
Why are u getting upset?

202
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:55,175
I am just adding to the
stuff you are already cooking up..

203
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,092
I am not cooking up anything.

204
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:50,925
You are not cut out
for this painting stuff?

205
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:54,175
Neither are you Raja, nor Ravi Varma.

206
00:21:55,675 --> 00:21:58,258
You carry that blank
canvas everywhere.

207
00:21:58,342 --> 00:22:00,258
But you never put any paint on it.

208
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,342
My dear friend, Debdas

209
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:07,300
One day I will paint my masterpiece.

210
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:11,300
And the world will watch.

211
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:17,800
I want to learn painting.

212
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:21,925
Why the sudden interest?

213
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,925
Its not sudden.

214
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,383
I've always been interested.

215
00:22:26,008 --> 00:22:28,133
You keep talking about.

216
00:22:28,842 --> 00:22:31,008
I've always told you,
I wanted to learn

217
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,925
You never told me.

218
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:36,133
I did you never listen to me.

219
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:40,800
Fine. Ask Majumdar Babu,
he'll get someone

220
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:43,342
Ask Devyani also

221
00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:46,592
Devyani only wants to cook.

222
00:22:47,925 --> 00:22:50,425
And there's no need
to look for anyone.

223
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:54,008
Varun Babu is a great painter

224
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,800
Finish your tea.

225
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:45,967
How do I look?

226
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:47,717
Very beautiful. Now go.

227
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,133
Now what?

228
00:23:58,633 --> 00:23:59,633
Just go

229
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,717
Have you tried to paint before?

230
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,300
I mean, when you used
to study in Shantiniketan.

231
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:30,217
You know that I used
to study in Shantiniketan?

232
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:35,467
No. As in since you
are the Zamindar's daughter.

233
00:24:38,758 --> 00:24:40,675
I learnt a little.

234
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:43,800
So what do you want to learn from me?

235
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,508
You tell me.

236
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:53,633
Lets begin with landscapes.

237
00:24:55,717 --> 00:24:58,175
They are easy to grasp.

238
00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:00,300
Then once you get a hang of it..

239
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:02,258
No. After mangoes and apples,

240
00:25:02,342 --> 00:25:05,800
the first thing
they taught us was Landscapes.

241
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:08,800
Can't we learn portraits?

242
00:25:12,842 --> 00:25:15,425
You don't think I know
how to paint a landscape?

243
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,217
Shall I show you?

244
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:44,883
You know how to paint.

245
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:52,758
I don't know how to paint leaves.

246
00:25:55,092 --> 00:25:56,092
Leaves!

247
00:25:57,925 --> 00:25:59,592
They are really easy

248
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:01,925
Show me.

249
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,133
Sure

250
00:26:27,717 --> 00:26:29,383
Take some green

251
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:39,717
Take some black

252
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:53,092
What is this?

253
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:56,633
Leaves

254
00:26:58,842 --> 00:26:59,842
This?

255
00:27:04,717 --> 00:27:06,717
Its Modern Art.

256
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:15,967
You don't know how to paint, do you?

257
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,008
So you are a teacher to him?

258
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:30,425
For the class to run,
someone has to be a teacher

259
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:35,967
Someone is too smart for his own good.

260
00:27:36,758 --> 00:27:39,092
I always wanted to learn painting.

261
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:40,651
And this is a good opportunity. No?

262
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:41,675
Of course.

263
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:33,592
My father calls me Pakhi Express

264
00:30:33,842 --> 00:30:36,300
Because I'm always in a hurry

265
00:30:37,425 --> 00:30:39,217
What do you want to do?

266
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,758
I want to write.

267
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:43,675
Lots and lots of books.

268
00:30:45,508 --> 00:30:47,883
Sometimes, I feel like running away

269
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:50,383
to our house in Dalhousie.

270
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,550
While the snow keeps falling outside,

271
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:54,925
Inside I keep..
- Writing, writing and more writing

272
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:00,758
The Raja there has a big palace.

273
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:03,883
Jandhrighat palace.

274
00:31:04,008 --> 00:31:08,050
That Raja is very rich.
Much more than my father.

275
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,675
And he also has an
ancient unique Ganesha idol

276
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:13,967
Is it?

277
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,967
Made of pure gold.
At least five hundred years old.

278
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:26,217
Do you like what you do?

279
00:31:29,425 --> 00:31:31,258
This is all I know.

280
00:31:40,175 --> 00:31:43,342
I've never known
anything other than this.

281
00:31:44,675 --> 00:31:47,800
If you get a chance
to do something else,

282
00:31:47,883 --> 00:31:49,717
What would you do?

283
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:54,258
Tell me..

284
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:05,800
I want to see Chandratal before I die.

285
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,133
Where is that?

286
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:13,592
Beyond Manali. Deep in the Himalayas.

287
00:32:16,383 --> 00:32:22,383
Clear blue waters, And not a sound.

288
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,258
None at all?

289
00:32:33,675 --> 00:32:34,675
No

290
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
And?

291
00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:39,800
I want to paint a masterpiece

292
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:41,800
that the world will remember.

293
00:32:42,175 --> 00:32:43,258
Really?

294
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:46,258
Yes. Don't tell anyone.

295
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,592
And if I tell?

296
00:34:18,175 --> 00:34:19,633
It's a flat tyre.

297
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,258
Will take sometime.

298
00:34:39,967 --> 00:34:42,050
What happened?

299
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:44,342
Pakhi?

300
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:18,383
Why didn't you tell me?

301
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:56,217
Pakhi is a good girl.

302
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:01,383
And you will have to break her heart

303
00:38:05,592 --> 00:38:09,258
She will be shattered when you leave.

304
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:15,383
And if I say that I love her?

305
00:38:16,883 --> 00:38:21,592
You aren't allowed to love, Mr.
Srivastava

306
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:26,383
If you want to love,
you need permission.

307
00:38:27,592 --> 00:38:30,717
And that stone-hearted
uncle wont give it to you.

308
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,008
Varun Babu

309
00:40:12,383 --> 00:40:13,842
No class today?

310
00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:18,550
Yes. Our work is about to finish.

311
00:40:18,758 --> 00:40:20,258
There isn't enough time.

312
00:40:21,425 --> 00:40:22,883
We can learn here also.

313
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:25,217
No. Not here.

314
00:40:30,425 --> 00:40:31,758
No problem.

315
00:40:31,842 --> 00:40:33,467
Tomorrow?

316
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:38,467
No.

317
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,217
The day after that?

318
00:40:55,425 --> 00:40:57,300
Next week?

319
00:40:59,342 --> 00:41:01,550
I leave next week.

320
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:10,592
There's a lot of pending work here.

321
00:41:10,675 --> 00:41:12,967
Everyone's waiting for me.

322
00:41:14,758 --> 00:41:16,383
So am I

323
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:28,425
It would be better if you leave.

324
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,300
It would be best, if you die

325
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,925
They can dig two feet more by morning.

326
00:42:03,758 --> 00:42:06,258
That's not great,
when will the other work happen?

327
00:42:08,383 --> 00:42:10,967
Why are you doing this to me?

328
00:42:24,425 --> 00:42:26,467
Come on get back to work.

329
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,193
What's the matter with you today?

330
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:33,967
With me? What's the matter with you?

331
00:42:34,883 --> 00:42:36,633
Why are you doing this to me?

332
00:42:36,967 --> 00:42:38,633
It's like you don't want to see me.

333
00:42:38,883 --> 00:42:40,883
Like I'm nothing to you.

334
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,300
Do I mean anything to you?

335
00:42:48,925 --> 00:42:50,842
I leave next tuesday.

336
00:42:52,717 --> 00:42:55,300
And, the time that we spent together?

337
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,717
You wanted to learn painting

338
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,217
And you didn't know how to!

339
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,342
Why did you agree?

340
00:43:02,633 --> 00:43:04,300
You could have said No then.

341
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:05,800
I was stupid.

342
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:19,675
Do you love me, Varun Babu?

343
00:43:27,592 --> 00:43:29,842
Please say yes.

344
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,675
Don't think so much. You
did the right thing.

345
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:13,383
No need to be my guardian angel.

346
00:44:14,633 --> 00:44:16,008
Eat your food

347
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,383
Uncle sent a telegram asking

348
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:24,050
why is it taking so much time?

349
00:44:34,425 --> 00:44:37,050
Biswajeet Roy, Treasury Department.

350
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:39,300
What department is this?

351
00:44:39,508 --> 00:44:42,800
There is an official
seal on the letter.

352
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:11,675
This is ..

353
00:45:11,967 --> 00:45:15,842
The East India Company gifted
that to my grandfather.

354
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:18,508
Its at least two hundred years old.

355
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,342
Even more

356
00:45:21,633 --> 00:45:22,633
Pal Babu

357
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,300
Put all of these into our van

358
00:45:25,258 --> 00:45:26,592
What are you doing?

359
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:28,717
All of this is India's heritage

360
00:45:29,217 --> 00:45:31,359
It will go to the National
Treasury and then maybe to the Musuem.

361
00:45:31,383 --> 00:45:34,842
This is my family
heritage. You cant take it.

362
00:45:34,925 --> 00:45:38,842
Whatever the East India
Company gave you was not theirs.

363
00:45:39,508 --> 00:45:41,258
It was all stolen.

364
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:43,550
If you wont co-operate,
then we will have to arrest you.

365
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:46,008
Arrest me?

366
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:49,467
In Manekpur? In my own village?

367
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,633
Pardon me

368
00:45:50,717 --> 00:45:53,800
I'm a government servant not yours.

369
00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:08,383
The world has changed Varun Babu

370
00:46:09,925 --> 00:46:15,175
Its improved for you and ended for us.

371
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:20,633
I was so used to this way of life.

372
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:24,592
That even after you
and Majumdar warned me

373
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:28,758
I didn't think I would lose everything

374
00:46:29,383 --> 00:46:33,550
The country got free
from British yoke..

375
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:37,550
But that freedom cost us dearly.

376
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:50,633
You still own a lot of
assets that are very valuable.

377
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,592
I can help you

378
00:46:54,883 --> 00:46:58,508
There are a lot of buyers out there

379
00:47:03,425 --> 00:47:06,175
The government wants to destroy us.

380
00:47:06,758 --> 00:47:10,008
They think we were
friends with the English

381
00:47:11,008 --> 00:47:12,800
But our hands were tied

382
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:15,592
We gave money to
the Indian National Army

383
00:47:16,175 --> 00:47:20,842
Was it our fault if the Government
didn't accept their fight to freedom?

384
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:33,675
Call them

385
00:47:36,258 --> 00:47:38,008
Sell everything.

386
00:48:00,925 --> 00:48:02,633
Put that away

387
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:07,175
Did you hit me?

388
00:48:07,258 --> 00:48:10,300
The Zamindar is ready to sell

389
00:48:12,092 --> 00:48:14,050
Inform uncle

390
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,133
Once the labourers leave tomorrow,

391
00:48:31,217 --> 00:48:33,342
we will start digging
in this direction

392
00:48:33,425 --> 00:48:35,800
All this mud can
be removed and put here

393
00:48:36,925 --> 00:48:40,217
We have to finish this in three nights

394
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:49,758
Its the first car
I owned very dear to me

395
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,925
Hope you take good care of her

396
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:53,050
I will

397
00:49:01,258 --> 00:49:03,050
Meet my friend, Varun Srivastava

398
00:49:03,258 --> 00:49:03,800
Hello

399
00:49:03,883 --> 00:49:04,883
Mr. Mukherjee

400
00:49:06,133 --> 00:49:07,383
He's bought my car.

401
00:49:08,883 --> 00:49:09,467
To Calcutta?

402
00:49:09,633 --> 00:49:10,967
Yes today itself

403
00:49:11,217 --> 00:49:12,883
Can Deb go with him?

404
00:49:13,092 --> 00:49:14,925
Ask him, I have no problem

405
00:49:18,092 --> 00:49:19,550
Zamindar Babu,

406
00:49:23,758 --> 00:49:25,967
I'll also be leaving
in a couple of days

407
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,633
The month is up? So soon?

408
00:49:30,883 --> 00:49:36,633
Our work is done. We didn't find anything

409
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:45,050
All the best

410
00:49:45,842 --> 00:49:47,133
Thank you

411
00:53:30,425 --> 00:53:34,717
Zamindar Babu, I really love Pakhi

412
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,717
I want to marry your daughter

413
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:45,750
What does your father do?

414
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:49,958
My parents are dead

415
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:52,625
I don't even remember them

416
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:55,958
I have an uncle

417
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:59,833
He raised me. Taught
me everything I know

418
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:03,958
Call him here

419
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,417
He wont come

420
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,333
Why not?

421
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:18,000
He wont allow it

422
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:20,708
Won't allow what?

423
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:23,875
Zamindar Babu, we will get
married and go some place else.

424
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,750
I really love your daughter

425
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:34,792
I'll make sure she stays happy always

426
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,708
I would give my life for her

427
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:50,625
Please write...

428
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:54,583
'Zamindar Soumitra Ray Chaudhry
cordially invites you to the..

429
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,792
Engagement of his beloved daughter..

430
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:06,875
Pakhi Ray Chaudhry
with Varun Srivastava.

431
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:09,708
Done?

432
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:11,292
Yes

433
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,125
Mr. Roy Choudhry? - Mr. Bajpai

434
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,625
How was the journey?

435
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:42,292
Good. Thank you

436
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:44,542
Some kind of celebration going on?

437
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,250
My daughter is getting engaged

438
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:47,458
Congratulations

439
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:49,583
You're getting married to Pakhi?

440
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:55,333
And what will you tell Bajpai Uncle?

441
00:55:57,792 --> 00:55:58,792
I don't know

442
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:00,125
So why are you doing all this?

443
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,858
Do you want to completely ruin her?

444
00:56:08,067 --> 00:56:09,692
What are you hiding from me?

445
00:56:10,192 --> 00:56:10,858
Nothing

446
00:56:10,942 --> 00:56:13,525
There is something

447
00:56:15,483 --> 00:56:16,692
Where is the engagement?

448
00:56:16,817 --> 00:56:18,025
At the temple

449
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:19,442
When?

450
00:56:19,608 --> 00:56:20,692
Tomorrow

451
00:56:20,817 --> 00:56:22,192
Tomorrow?

452
00:56:23,858 --> 00:56:24,900
And our work?

453
00:56:26,275 --> 00:56:28,525
Its your work now. Get it done.

454
00:56:28,608 --> 00:56:31,650
No, its our work

455
00:56:48,692 --> 00:56:50,317
Bajpai Uncle

456
00:56:52,567 --> 00:56:54,233
Congratulations Varun

457
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:56,233
Heard

458
00:57:23,275 --> 00:57:28,067
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

459
00:57:30,858 --> 00:57:33,650
Uncle, I have to get married sometime

460
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:36,900
I never got married

461
00:57:39,442 --> 00:57:41,650
How would I have taken
care of you boys, if I had?

462
00:57:44,275 --> 00:57:45,733
I know what you did for us

463
00:57:45,817 --> 00:57:48,733
Taught us everything

464
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,733
I did everything you asked me to

465
00:57:58,192 --> 00:58:00,567
Does she know what
you do for a living?

466
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:03,983
Why you're here?

467
00:58:08,275 --> 00:58:10,358
Suraj was killed

468
00:58:11,775 --> 00:58:13,567
He was trying to escape

469
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,900
He had two daughters and a son

470
00:58:19,067 --> 00:58:20,942
You know that

471
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:24,817
This is the life we live

472
00:58:25,983 --> 00:58:28,275
Is this what you want to give her?

473
00:58:36,692 --> 00:58:40,483
I want you in Calcutta tomorrow

474
00:58:41,233 --> 00:58:46,900
We cant afford the luxury
of relationships in our work

475
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,775
You still tried

476
00:58:50,092 --> 00:58:53,883
Don't think I cant tell your
father-in-law what you really are

477
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,550
Good morning gentlemen

478
01:01:58,133 --> 01:01:59,300
Happy?

479
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:01,883
Congratulations, lets go

480
01:03:06,175 --> 01:03:08,133
Fake, they're all fake

481
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:09,883
Not a single original note

482
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:57,375
Dinner is ready

483
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:15,833
Should I go home?

484
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:19,542
Yes

485
01:06:22,167 --> 01:06:23,792
Do you need anything else?

486
01:06:25,167 --> 01:06:26,167
No

487
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:39,625
Ms Pakhi

488
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:47,292
You know Varun better than anyone

489
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:50,500
If you wont help then it is

490
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:53,167
difficult to nab their whole gang.

491
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:03,458
What happened in Manekpur,

492
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:05,583
has happened many times before

493
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,333
This gang has robbed millions
from Zamindars and Rajas

494
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:11,125
Many families have been ruined

495
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:14,833
Your father wasn't the
only one who died because of them

496
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:19,833
My father didn't die
because he was robbed

497
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:26,625
He was heartbroken

498
01:08:29,625 --> 01:08:31,292
He trusted Varun.

499
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,000
If he were alive,

500
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:38,125
he would want Varun to pay, isn't it?

501
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:41,917
I don't want revenge, Mr. Singh

502
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:44,542
I just want to forget him

503
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,250
Ok

504
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:02,792
If you need anything or..

505
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:08,250
If you feel like sharing something,

506
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,083
You could contact me on this number.

507
01:09:29,417 --> 01:09:30,583
What are you writing?

508
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:37,833
Some story?

509
01:09:38,042 --> 01:09:39,042
Yes

510
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:43,458
What story?

511
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:47,958
Its just a story

512
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:53,208
Is there a boy in the story?

513
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:58,917
And a girl?

514
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:01,250
Yes

515
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:05,833
Do they love each other?

516
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,667
No

517
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:16,583
Are they going to fall in love?

518
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:22,000
I don't know

519
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:35,125
The boy wants to know something

520
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,833
The girl isn't talking to him

521
01:10:41,917 --> 01:10:43,625
Is she angry?

522
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:46,375
Yes

523
01:10:47,917 --> 01:10:49,375
Because he's leaving?

524
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:52,958
Because he's asking too many questions

525
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,083
So what is she saying?

526
01:10:57,792 --> 01:11:00,708
Don't ask so many questions

527
01:11:01,292 --> 01:11:02,458
So?

528
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:06,417
Has he stopped asking questions?

529
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:13,333
He's a fool

530
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:17,208
Doesn't even understand a thing

531
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:27,458
Has the boy told the
girl how beautiful she is?

532
01:11:31,292 --> 01:11:34,167
That there's nobody more beautiful
than her in the whole world.

533
01:11:37,917 --> 01:11:38,958
No

534
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:45,042
Has the girl told the boy
that she loves him the most?

535
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:48,708
No

536
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:55,167
So when is she going to tell him?

537
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:02,708
When?

538
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:39,208
Dalhousie police station

539
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:41,333
Can I talk to Inspector K N Singh?

540
01:12:41,417 --> 01:12:42,625
Who s' speaking?

541
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:44,208
Pakhi Ray Choudhry

542
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:02,000
KN Singh speaking

543
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:06,750
He had once told me
that the Raja of Jandhrighat

544
01:13:06,958 --> 01:13:10,875
owns a valuable idol of Ganesha.
Made of pure gold

545
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:14,500
Maybe their next target
will be in Dalhousie.

546
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:16,375
Thank you

547
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:18,458
Ok

548
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:12,000
Guesthouse available on rent

549
01:15:43,542 --> 01:15:44,750
Its tuberculosis

550
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,667
Its life threatening

551
01:15:47,792 --> 01:15:49,625
You should move to a warm place

552
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,167
You will live longer

553
01:15:54,333 --> 01:15:56,583
Everyone dies some day

554
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:59,125
What should I live for?

555
01:16:02,417 --> 01:16:04,125
You could write another book

556
01:16:08,917 --> 01:16:11,875
My life is being taken
by what I am writing

557
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:41,500
There's two men at the gate

558
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:42,958
For the guesthouse

559
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,042
What should I do?

560
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:48,792
Show it to them

561
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:54,292
Who stays out there?

562
01:18:54,625 --> 01:18:57,542
The Lady of the house.

563
01:19:28,583 --> 01:19:28,958
Hello

564
01:19:29,042 --> 01:19:32,417
Ms Pakhi, this is Inspector K N Singh

565
01:19:32,792 --> 01:19:33,333
Yes

566
01:19:33,417 --> 01:19:39,708
I called to inform you that
the gang leader has been arrested

567
01:19:40,583 --> 01:19:44,125
He's confessed that Varun and Debdas

568
01:19:44,292 --> 01:19:46,292
should be reaching
Dalhousie any day now.

569
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:50,208
We have booked all the
places where they can stay

570
01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:53,750
They will eventually
reach your cottage

571
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:57,708
As soon as they do, please call me

572
01:20:06,542 --> 01:20:08,542
Excuse me, Mr. Vijay?

573
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:09,917
What happened?

574
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,833
How do you plan to ship the idol?

575
01:20:24,042 --> 01:20:25,250
By truck

576
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,125
It's on its way from Delhi

577
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:28,958
And security?

578
01:20:29,208 --> 01:20:34,708
Six of our people
will accompany the truck

579
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:37,583
And if you wish,
you can send some people too

580
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,750
So how can I help?

581
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:43,167
We need to take measurements
of the idol for the shipping crate

582
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:47,167
So if you don't mind,
could we start work tomorrow?

583
01:20:48,167 --> 01:20:48,792
That's it?

584
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:50,917
We can stay here if you'd like

585
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,542
Come tomorrow

586
01:20:58,042 --> 01:21:00,667
I'll inform everyone here

587
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,542
K N Singh speaking

588
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:21,917
This is Devender Singh

589
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:24,458
It's them

590
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:26,708
Thank you

591
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,083
How many men do you have?

592
01:21:36,167 --> 01:21:36,708
Twelve

593
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:37,833
Do they all have weapon?

594
01:21:37,917 --> 01:21:38,917
We have .303

595
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,250
I want them all, immediately

596
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:42,792
Bajrangi, get them ready

597
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:04,208
He's not answering the phone

598
01:22:06,625 --> 01:22:07,917
Must be asleep

599
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:22,167
Listen..

600
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,375
Give me a cigarette

601
01:23:32,167 --> 01:23:33,542
We're being followed

602
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:45,208
You go left, I'll go right

603
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:47,125
Ok

604
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:48,958
See you here in fifteen minutes

605
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,250
Follow him

606
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:09,417
Come with me

607
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:57,958
Shoot

608
01:30:11,042 --> 01:30:12,226
Have you given him any medicine yet?

609
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:13,583
Not yet Doctor

610
01:30:13,833 --> 01:30:14,708
How far is it from here?

611
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:16,208
Five minutes

612
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:17,708
Is he breathing okay?

613
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,875
Mr. Singh?

614
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:33,833
He's been shot

615
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:37,083
Won't be able to get very far

616
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:40,000
He's in town and he's wounded

617
01:33:40,333 --> 01:33:42,167
Spread the word

618
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:45,000
Put up his sketch everywhere

619
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:49,000
I want this man

620
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:52,250
Keep looking till you find him

621
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:54,917
Dead or Alive?

622
01:34:58,042 --> 01:35:03,042
You told the police!!

623
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:08,958
My friend died because of you

624
01:36:10,625 --> 01:36:12,625
I wont let you die so easy

625
01:36:13,917 --> 01:36:16,792
I didn't think you
had any emotion in you

626
01:36:17,125 --> 01:36:18,958
You still don't know a lot, Pakhi.

627
01:36:19,667 --> 01:36:20,750
Please leave, Varun

628
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:22,042
I need a place to hide

629
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:23,708
You wont get it here

630
01:36:25,542 --> 01:36:27,167
Leave or I'll call the police

631
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:28,750
You wont

632
01:36:42,875 --> 01:36:43,667
Close the door, Shyama

633
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:44,542
Are you mad, Varun?

634
01:36:44,625 --> 01:36:46,333
Close the door, Shyama

635
01:36:48,292 --> 01:36:50,042
Did the police stop you?

636
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:08,083
Did they ask you any questions?

637
01:37:08,167 --> 01:37:08,625
No

638
01:37:08,917 --> 01:37:10,917
Don't try to fool me, Shyama

639
01:37:14,667 --> 01:37:16,750
Your sketch is up everywhere

640
01:37:17,375 --> 01:37:18,792
They're looking for you

641
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:22,958
You've been accused of
killing a police constable

642
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:27,625
And they say that
you killed your friend

643
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,625
You killed Deb?

644
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,167
There are shoot-at-sight
orders for you.

645
01:37:37,667 --> 01:37:38,708
Who are you?

646
01:37:38,792 --> 01:37:40,917
He is an avatar of Lord Vishnu, Shyama

647
01:37:41,125 --> 01:37:42,875
With ten names and faces.

648
01:37:47,417 --> 01:37:49,583
I didn't kill Deb on purpose

649
01:37:49,792 --> 01:37:52,083
He was my friend, like my brother

650
01:37:52,167 --> 01:37:53,250
And the police constable?

651
01:37:53,333 --> 01:37:56,667
They were firing at me,
So I fired back It was a mistake.

652
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:58,125
What was I supposed to do?

653
01:37:58,208 --> 01:37:59,667
I don't believe you

654
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:00,417
It's the truth

655
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:01,726
You should have said the truth then,

656
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:02,500
a lot would have been saved

657
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:05,500
I couldn't betray Deb and Bajpai Uncle

658
01:38:05,792 --> 01:38:09,125
He raised us,
when we were this little.

659
01:38:09,208 --> 01:38:12,167
I couldn't just abandon them

660
01:38:12,958 --> 01:38:14,583
But you could abandon me

661
01:38:15,583 --> 01:38:17,625
You could betray my trust

662
01:38:19,708 --> 01:38:20,917
You wouldn't understand

663
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:22,750
You've seen nothing

664
01:38:22,792 --> 01:38:24,708
You've lived in luxury all your life.

665
01:38:24,792 --> 01:38:26,500
You wouldn't understand anything.

666
01:38:33,958 --> 01:38:34,542
Keep it

667
01:38:34,625 --> 01:38:36,667
Use it in the kitchen

668
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:52,042
Should i call the police?

669
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:53,792
No.

670
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:57,625
Why are you trying to save him?

671
01:39:25,375 --> 01:39:28,500
Hello?

672
01:39:28,583 --> 01:39:29,750
Chaubey?

673
01:39:30,083 --> 01:39:31,083
Its Nandu

674
01:39:35,792 --> 01:39:37,292
I will leave tomorrow morning

675
01:39:38,875 --> 01:39:40,542
I'll have to spend the night here

676
01:39:42,083 --> 01:39:44,167
You can call the police, if you want

677
01:39:54,583 --> 01:39:54,958
Zamindar Babu..

678
01:39:55,042 --> 01:39:56,042
Is dead.

679
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:02,500
How?

680
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:06,625
You killed him

681
01:40:09,042 --> 01:40:11,000
Like you killed Deb

682
01:40:13,125 --> 01:40:14,458
It wasn't your fault

683
01:41:18,125 --> 01:41:19,667
I am going home

684
01:41:21,667 --> 01:41:23,375
I won't tell the police anything

685
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:41,500
I came here to run away from my past

686
01:41:41,667 --> 01:41:43,500
To forget everything

687
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,458
Why did you come back to my life?

688
01:41:47,125 --> 01:41:49,500
Why did I allow you to?

689
01:41:49,583 --> 01:41:53,833
Why don't I just kill you,
when you are asleep?

690
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:58,417
It must give you so
much joy to see me like this

691
01:42:00,458 --> 01:42:01,958
You see that tree?

692
01:42:02,417 --> 01:42:05,583
I stare at it, day and night.
At its leaves that fall

693
01:42:05,833 --> 01:42:07,458
It's like the Bheel Raja's parrot..

694
01:42:08,417 --> 01:42:09,833
It has my life inside it.

695
01:42:12,208 --> 01:42:15,208
The day the..

696
01:42:16,708 --> 01:42:21,625
Last leaf falls..

697
01:42:22,292 --> 01:42:24,833
Is the day I will breathe my last.

698
01:42:25,583 --> 01:42:28,500
This is where you have brought me to

699
01:42:33,167 --> 01:42:36,250
I hope you are ashamed
of living like this

700
01:42:37,417 --> 01:42:40,583
But I know you don't care

701
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:43,875
As always, all you will do is hide

702
01:45:46,167 --> 01:45:47,292
Nandu!

703
01:46:36,583 --> 01:46:38,542
Its still unsafe outside

704
01:46:40,042 --> 01:46:42,000
I will have to stay
here for a few more days

705
01:47:15,833 --> 01:47:17,417
Tea

706
01:47:30,292 --> 01:47:31,583
I don't want

707
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:40,125
What are you trying to prove? ..

708
01:47:40,333 --> 01:47:41,333
Nothing

709
01:47:41,667 --> 01:47:42,583
When you should have done..

710
01:47:42,667 --> 01:47:43,792
I went away, I know.

711
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:45,375
You were surrounded by people.

712
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I know what you want.

713
01:47:50,125 --> 01:47:51,417
Is it? What?

714
01:47:51,958 --> 01:47:54,250
Once wasn't enough for you.

715
01:47:54,458 --> 01:47:57,167
Of course, since you're
looking beautiful these days

716
01:47:58,083 --> 01:47:59,208
I am not joking

717
01:47:59,292 --> 01:48:01,000
I don't know how to make jokes

718
01:48:02,208 --> 01:48:04,208
Why don't you eat something,
then we can..

719
01:48:04,292 --> 01:48:05,292
Just leave

720
01:48:05,417 --> 01:48:05,917
Pakhi

721
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,125
Don't say my name!

722
01:48:07,333 --> 01:48:09,500
Don't shout, you'll get another attack

723
01:48:22,875 --> 01:48:24,083
See, I told you

724
01:48:24,167 --> 01:48:24,542
Why are you..

725
01:48:24,625 --> 01:48:25,625
Shut up

726
01:50:32,792 --> 01:50:35,875
Sometimes I feel like murdering you.

727
01:50:38,083 --> 01:50:40,417
I hate you so much.

728
01:50:42,542 --> 01:50:46,000
But i don't have the strength anymore

729
01:50:47,833 --> 01:50:50,250
I just want to release Varun

730
01:50:52,875 --> 01:50:54,000
from you,

731
01:50:56,083 --> 01:50:57,333
from myself,

732
01:50:58,083 --> 01:51:01,458
from this life

733
01:57:21,875 --> 01:57:23,208
May I come in?

734
01:57:29,958 --> 01:57:32,875
I tried calling, quite a few times

735
01:57:34,167 --> 01:57:36,375
No one answered is everything ok?

736
01:57:38,333 --> 01:57:40,667
Just a little cough

737
01:57:42,583 --> 01:57:45,375
Did you see him or meet him?

738
01:57:46,167 --> 01:57:47,167
Who?

739
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:49,750
Varun

740
01:57:50,625 --> 01:57:52,667
Why would I meet him?

741
01:57:52,917 --> 01:57:55,667
You said he might come

742
01:57:56,042 --> 01:57:57,708
The guesthouse is still empty

743
01:57:57,792 --> 01:57:59,625
The 'For Rent' board is still there

744
01:58:00,458 --> 01:58:01,458
Yes

745
01:58:04,542 --> 01:58:05,750
Can I look inside?

746
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:08,083
Do you have a warrant?

747
01:58:08,250 --> 01:58:09,375
Sorry?

748
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:11,875
Do you have a warrant?

749
01:58:13,875 --> 01:58:15,917
I don't have one right now,

750
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,292
but I can get one tomorrow

751
01:58:18,375 --> 01:58:20,208
Then please come tomorrow

752
01:58:22,083 --> 01:58:24,417
Why are you trying to protect him?

753
01:58:24,583 --> 01:58:26,250
I am not protecting anyone

754
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:28,958
He's responsible
for your father's death,

755
01:58:29,042 --> 01:58:31,333
and he shot one of my men

756
01:58:32,292 --> 01:58:36,708
He will spend the
rest of his life in jail

757
01:58:36,875 --> 01:58:38,875
He might even hang

758
01:58:41,458 --> 01:58:44,375
I'll be back tomorrow with the warrant

759
01:58:44,833 --> 01:58:48,542
I'll have ten policemen
with me who I am leaving outside

760
01:58:48,708 --> 01:58:51,750
If he tries to escape
at night, they will shoot him

761
01:58:51,833 --> 01:58:54,500
If not, then tomorrow I will shoot him

762
01:58:55,125 --> 01:58:56,958
I already shot him once,

763
01:58:57,167 --> 01:59:00,667
He's badly injured but he got away

764
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:04,000
Not this time

765
01:59:49,917 --> 01:59:51,792
Do you know my real name?

766
01:59:55,250 --> 01:59:56,458
What?

767
02:00:00,833 --> 02:00:02,708
Atmanand Tripathi

768
02:00:25,292 --> 02:00:27,542
You look beautiful when you smile

769
02:00:31,083 --> 02:00:33,417
KN Singh is going to kill you

770
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:38,917
You know what Deb
would have said to that?

771
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:40,500
What?

772
02:00:42,042 --> 02:00:47,875
There isn't a KN Singh or Rahman
alive who can ruin Dev Anand's hair

773
02:00:49,250 --> 02:00:51,208
You are not a hero

774
02:00:52,917 --> 02:00:54,833
He wont be able to touch me

775
02:00:55,833 --> 02:00:58,292
I have escaped from much worse

776
02:00:59,333 --> 02:01:01,542
He'll bring the warrant tomorrow

777
02:01:02,958 --> 02:01:04,708
I'll leave tonight

778
02:01:14,708 --> 02:01:16,792
Don't look away Pakhi

779
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:21,000
Look at me

780
02:01:33,417 --> 02:01:36,458
I know you don't believe a word I say,

781
02:01:36,542 --> 02:01:38,583
But today I'm not lying

782
02:01:38,833 --> 02:01:44,542
I cannot forgive myself
for what I did to you

783
02:01:44,792 --> 02:01:47,417
Only you have the right to do that

784
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:49,292
But I hate myself

785
02:01:49,375 --> 02:01:52,750
and I will keep hating
myself as long as I live

786
02:01:54,625 --> 02:01:57,042
Did you ever love me Varun?

787
02:01:58,167 --> 02:02:00,292
I did

788
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:02,750
I still do

789
02:02:04,708 --> 02:02:07,625
You were my only chance
to lead a better life

790
02:02:07,708 --> 02:02:09,333
And I threw it away

791
02:02:10,833 --> 02:02:13,417
Everyone in my life used me

792
02:02:14,917 --> 02:02:16,500
Only you loved me

793
02:02:17,833 --> 02:02:19,792
And I couldn't love you back

794
02:02:24,458 --> 02:02:29,083
This isn't the life
you should be living

795
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,167
Depending on that
last leaf isn't right

796
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:36,708
It isn't your parrot

797
02:02:36,917 --> 02:02:38,875
And if it falls?

798
02:02:42,167 --> 02:02:43,417
It wont

799
02:02:45,167 --> 02:02:47,458
That's my promise.
