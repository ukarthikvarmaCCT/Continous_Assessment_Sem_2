1
00:00:40,504 --> 00:00:41,423
Position the camera.

2
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:43,218
Be ready.

3
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:45,391
Start camera.

4
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:47,466
Action!

5
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:48,967
Sir.

6
00:01:51,413 --> 00:01:52,689
Gajendra spotted, sir.

7
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:53,467
Are you sure?

8
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:54,764
Yes, sir. Gajendra Sahu.

9
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,353
He is not an ordinary target.

10
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:59,143
He is the most wanted
criminal of this terrain.

11
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:04,052
Forests and the water bodies
are being ruined by him.

12
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:05,901
Industries are vanishing.

13
00:02:06,484 --> 00:02:08,858
Hundreds of police officers,
military men

14
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:10,927
and thousands of civilians
died in an effort to nab him.

15
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:13,111
He is a high value target.

16
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:17,944
If he smells your presence there,
none of you would be alive.

17
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:19,371
You will all die.

18
00:03:00,991 --> 00:03:04,743
(Chants)

19
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:08,494
(Chants)

20
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:12,180
(Chants)

21
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:13,965
(Chants)

22
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:16,718
That great soul isn't somewhere far.

23
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:20,016
He is right here in the green tree
that's growing in front of you.

24
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:22,139
That is His form.

25
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:24,722
He exists in the flowing river.

26
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,895
The mantra that he gives us is
the sound of that flowing river.

27
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:33,186
He exists in the pure,
fresh air that you breathe.

28
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:38,138
That is how He gives us life.

29
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:43,215
If we destroy any of these three things

30
00:03:43,976 --> 00:03:45,267
would the human
kind be able to survive?

31
00:03:45,652 --> 00:03:48,181
Will the next generation
be able to take birth?

32
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:51,382
Protecting them is the
gift that you give me.

33
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:55,890
The nature is the form that
the five elements.

34
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,949
It is the truest form of the almighty.

35
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,666
This is the truth.

36
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:03,846
Believe this and
shape your living accordingly.

37
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,479
May everything in the
entire world prosper.

38
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:12,506
(Chants)

39
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:16,366
(Chants)

40
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:19,090
(Chants)

41
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:20,798
Gajendra.

42
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:44,572
You've been wanting
to ask me something.

43
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:45,848
Go ahead and ask me.

44
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:48,789
Why do they bow to you?

45
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:50,821
Many practitioners of yogic lifestyle,
accomplished people

46
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:54,724
and extraordinary men,
walked the path of Dharma

47
00:04:55,286 --> 00:04:57,253
and established this place of worship.

48
00:04:57,502 --> 00:05:01,329
Their respect is not for this body.
They respect that place of worship.

49
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:03,523
I want that place of worship.

50
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,718
What will you do after you have it?

51
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:09,123
I am going to use the five
elements that you spoke about.

52
00:05:09,203 --> 00:05:12,194
I will ruin the country that killed me.

53
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,000
You must never challenge the fate,
the one who writes our fate,

54
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:17,254
and the entire world.

55
00:05:18,313 --> 00:05:21,599
The response they give you is something
you will not be able to handle.

56
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:22,659
Response?

57
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,589
Tell it to come.

58
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:27,174
No matter when it comes to me,
or in what form

59
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:29,394
or even if it comes in front of me
with a lot of strength,

60
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:30,767
I will take it on.

61
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:33,448
According to the will of the God.

62
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:08,809
Sir, you've been blessed with twins.

63
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:14,312
One of them is alive and
there is no movement in the other one.

64
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:15,458
What do I do?

65
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,496
(Chants)

66
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:26,452
(Chants)

67
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:28,204
Seer, you never set foot
in anyone's house,

68
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:29,252
you came to our house.

69
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:35,079
(Chants)

70
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:44,051
(Chants)

71
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,494
(Chants)

72
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,505
According to the will of the God.

73
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:57,262
(Chants)

74
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:04,646
(Chants)

75
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:09,781
Mr. Ramachandra, this one is nature.
That one is a natural disaster.

76
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:14,462
Cultivate your relationship with this one.
Cut the cords of this one from you.

77
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:22,830
You will understand at the right time,
try to understand.

78
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:25,522
(Chants)

79
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:29,850
Seer, as a father,
I cannot do anything.

80
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,312
If the mother knows,
she is going to die.

81
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:45,307
(Chants)

82
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,232
(Chants)

83
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:10,410
(Chants)

84
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,831
(Chants)

85
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:19,913
(Chants)

86
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:24,335
Lord.

87
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,984
(Chants)

88
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,978
(Chants)

89
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:49,028
(Chants)

90
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:53,742
(Chants)

91
00:08:54,045 --> 00:09:00,294
(Chants)

92
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:04,651
Lord, the child you gave
to a gypsy like me,

93
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:07,354
it hasn't opened his eyes yet.

94
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:10,582
I don't know about his birth,

95
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:12,781
the destination he is going to reach.

96
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:15,742
So, I hand him to You.

97
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:16,921
I offer him to you Lord Shiva.

98
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:24,078
Hail Lord Shiva!

99
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:30,856
you gave me this

100
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:34,413
(Chants)

101
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,965
Supreme being of disaster.

102
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:39,450
You have taken a big decision.

103
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:43,007
And now, he is your responsibility.

104
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:54,545
Son.
- Father.

105
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,649
When you let go of working for Rajappa

106
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,383
and worked alongside with me,

107
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:02,308
look at how abundantly
the crop has grown.

108
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:03,977
I can't believe it.
- Yes, father.

109
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:09,616
God, shower your benevolence on us.

110
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:13,648
Break the coconut.
Let's start the harvest.

111
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,902
What's going on?

112
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:26,427
I heard you quit the job.

113
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:29,605
I was the one who held him back.
- Why?

114
00:10:29,951 --> 00:10:32,217
That great man gave us farmland
when we didn't have any.

115
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,221
He also gave us seedlings.

116
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,465
We promised him that

117
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:38,372
we wouldn't get into fights.

118
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:40,989
Just because he gave you seedlings,
you obeyed him?

119
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,761
What if you don't have those seedlings?

120
00:10:43,755 --> 00:10:45,561
You will be back to being dogs in
front of my house, isn't it so?

121
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,140
Cut everything.

122
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,318
Please don't.

123
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,675
Sir, please don't do it.

124
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:53,918
Sir, please don't do it.

125
00:10:56,729 --> 00:11:00,329
Father.
- Sir, please don't ruin it.

126
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:04,761
I beg you. Please, don't.

127
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:14,809
Oh no! They are ruining Narsu's crop.

128
00:11:14,987 --> 00:11:18,101
Oh, my God! Oh Lord!

129
00:12:37,363 --> 00:12:38,811
Wait, Nandi!

130
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:55,848
Keshav,

131
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:58,683
even though your blood is boiling,

132
00:12:59,427 --> 00:13:02,099
you restrained your anger
because of the promise you made me.

133
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:04,573
Well done. You'll grow in life.

134
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:07,035
I am with you.

135
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,974
I'll take on the responsibility
of getting your sister married.

136
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:11,968
Hey,

137
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,168
you seem to be promising things
without knowing what we are capable of.

138
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:16,357
Hey,

139
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:20,497
are you famous to know you?

140
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:22,313
You are a small little creek.

141
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:59,230
If you mess with us, we are going to
sever your head off. Understand?

142
00:14:01,794 --> 00:14:05,555
If you mess with us,
I will give you a terrible death.

143
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,685
I won't kill the one who followed me,

144
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:09,447
but will kill each
and every one of you.

145
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,669
Whoever fights with me,
I'll attack them on their chest.

146
00:14:14,074 --> 00:14:18,042
Bow down to me and
I will spare your life.

147
00:14:27,922 --> 00:14:30,993
What's this route, brother?
- This is a shortcut.

148
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,711
Oh, my God! Looks like
an action movie is going on.

149
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,173
We might get hurt. We need to
get away from here immediately.

150
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:20,021
Action movie?

151
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:21,989
Why are they killing each other?

152
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:23,697
Let's scoot.

153
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:40,094
What are you looking at? Get him!

154
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:44,146
What's up!

155
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,718
Are you going to kill me? Go on.

156
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:48,232
Why should I kill you?

157
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:50,319
I asked that young man
to work for me.

158
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,379
What's wrong in it?

159
00:16:51,573 --> 00:16:52,856
When you are speaking to another person

160
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:54,741
learn how to conduct yourself.

161
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:57,817
There is a difference between asking,
'How is your father?' and

162
00:16:58,092 --> 00:17:02,136
'How is your mother's husband doing?'.

163
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:07,400
Raja, I already told you to stop
with these factional fights.

164
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:09,238
Keshav has reformed.

165
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,319
But you haven't.

166
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,773
That is why I needed to
put sense into you.

167
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:19,454
It's easy to build enemies,

168
00:17:20,135 --> 00:17:23,681
but it's difficult to win people over.
Try it.

169
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:28,048
I didn't hit you because you wronged,

170
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:29,691
I hit you to reform you.

171
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:32,718
A tree is like a vermillion dot
on the forehead.

172
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:34,513
If you cut it down,

173
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:37,735
there will be neither shelter nor
food or even existence of mankind.

174
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:44,427
Try and grow a tree with the very
hands that you used to cut them down.

175
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:49,769
Be the foundations of the society,
don't destroy it.

176
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,081
What work do you have here?

177
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:10,456
I am here to meet sir.
- Sir?

178
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:20,206
Sir, the situation is critical.

179
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:25,595
Bury her. Clean the room.

180
00:18:30,103 --> 00:18:32,856
When I went to the police station,
I was told sir is at the guesthouse

181
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:34,730
and asked to come here.

182
00:18:38,236 --> 00:18:38,906
Wow!

183
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:41,317
What's the matter?

184
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:45,663
My brother-in-law came home drunk
and beat up my sister, sir.

185
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:46,690
Why is that?

186
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,928
Because he is unhappy with my sister.

187
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:50,777
He wants me as well.

188
00:18:50,857 --> 00:18:53,944
He touches me inappropriately, sir.

189
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:55,187
Is that so?

190
00:18:55,403 --> 00:18:57,123
You?
- Yes.

191
00:18:57,307 --> 00:18:57,999
Damn it!

192
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:03,480
He has to be fated to get
married to someone like you.

193
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:06,529
How fair-skinned you are.

194
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:08,129
You're beautiful.

195
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:09,394
Do you know something?

196
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:13,653
If I wasn't married,
I would have married you blindly.

197
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:15,210
Come on, sir.

198
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:17,469
My brother-in-law isn't as
nice a person as you are.

199
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:20,010
I wonder why the goats
always vote for the butcher.

200
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:28,085
On the way. Hang up the phone.

201
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:32,756
I am going to meet with
the District Administrative Officer,

202
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,767
when I am back,
we will settle things between us

203
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:36,885
and then,
deal with your brother-in-law.

204
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,053
You freshen up,
I'll finish the work and be back.

205
00:19:42,312 --> 00:19:44,171
I will wait for you, sir.

206
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:06,934
Wow.

207
00:20:16,877 --> 00:20:17,877
Good morning, ma'am.

208
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:22,045
Ms. Padmavati, what brings you here?
- I was recently posted

209
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:25,710
as Principal Secretary in Environment
and Forest department.

210
00:20:26,057 --> 00:20:26,846
Please come.

211
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,058
I was trained under your mentorship.

212
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:32,695
I am happy to have the opportunity
of working with you.

213
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:34,398
It's your first posting,
a tough district,

214
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:36,349
a tough terrain and tough people.

215
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:37,700
Be little careful.

216
00:20:47,451 --> 00:20:49,559
Sir, the District Administrative
Officer is asking for you.

217
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,202
Since this is my joining day,
let's just sign and

218
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:05,528
go to your guesthouse.

219
00:21:08,218 --> 00:21:09,618
I am not that kind of a man, ma'am.

220
00:21:09,698 --> 00:21:11,917
Oh, really? Then, what is this?

221
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:28,026
Don't believe her, ma'am.
She is a prostitute.

222
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:35,193
She came to you for help because
the guy she fell in love cheated her

223
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:36,436
and you raped her.

224
00:21:40,587 --> 00:21:41,074
Ma'am...

225
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:44,631
You order her to be buried
though she was alive.

226
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:53,561
You are suspended.
- Ma'am, you don't know about me.

227
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:54,696
Shut up!

228
00:21:55,842 --> 00:21:57,571
Officer, arrest him.

229
00:21:57,777 --> 00:21:58,814
The evidence is right here.

230
00:21:58,894 --> 00:22:00,014
Okay, ma'am. Let's go.

231
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:02,101
Let's go, inspector.

232
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:06,296
There's no need.

233
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:09,021
I am there for you. Don't be scared.

234
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,129
Good job.

235
00:22:12,675 --> 00:22:13,453
Thank you, ma'am.

236
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,745
Who is the 'Uravakonda'
town concerned CI?

237
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:19,301
Sir, madam is asking for you.

238
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:20,923
Yes, ma'am.
- Your mobile number.

239
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:23,334
9866490050.

240
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:25,744
I've sent you a photo.

241
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,215
By the time I finish my
meeting with the minister,

242
00:22:29,485 --> 00:22:31,377
I want that man before me.

243
00:22:32,091 --> 00:22:33,205
We'll meet again, ma'am.

244
00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:44,676
Hello, boys and girls.

245
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:51,249
You all know who we've
been waiting for today.

246
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:55,151
We request the central minister,
Mr. Bharat Reddy

247
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,314
and the District Administrative Officer,
Ms. Sharanya Bajpayee

248
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:02,283
who is taking charge today,
to come onto the stage

249
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:06,100
and say a few words.
I request them to come on the stage.

250
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:08,867
He won the MP election
from our region and

251
00:23:08,947 --> 00:23:12,063
took on the responsibilities of
a Central Minister, Mr. Bharat Reddy

252
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:13,775
is with us today.

253
00:23:14,153 --> 00:23:16,553
This generation knows me
as the MP of this region.

254
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:20,115
But the previous generations
knows me very well.

255
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,384
Once upon a time,

256
00:23:22,504 --> 00:23:25,012
my family was prominent
in the factionalism of this region.

257
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,571
I am the only heir.

258
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:31,821
I would use my knife to get my way.

259
00:23:32,654 --> 00:23:35,471
But there was a great man
who told me that

260
00:23:35,551 --> 00:23:37,525
if I keep killing people,

261
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:40,254
I would be left with only graves.

262
00:23:42,665 --> 00:23:44,892
He mustered my courage.

263
00:23:44,972 --> 00:23:46,574
He took away the weapon from my hand,

264
00:23:46,654 --> 00:23:49,075
gave me a pen,
helped me win the MP elections.

265
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:51,255
He made me rise to the position
of a central minister and

266
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,427
put me in front you.

267
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:57,259
He replaced the hands
that held dagger with a plough.

268
00:23:57,778 --> 00:24:00,903
He placed books in the hands
of their children.

269
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:03,800
This is the result of such efforts.

270
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:11,109
But who did all this? A farmer.

271
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,287
He is the reformer of this region.

272
00:24:17,141 --> 00:24:19,087
Here comes the roaring lion.

273
00:24:51,232 --> 00:24:52,329
Greetings, officer.

274
00:24:52,751 --> 00:24:54,065
You asked me to meet with you,

275
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:55,518
I will see you after the function.

276
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:06,062
Sorry, I was delayed
because of a small meeting.

277
00:25:06,182 --> 00:25:07,875
Glory to you!

278
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,005
In any region, a wealthy person
is not the most respected man.

279
00:25:12,664 --> 00:25:14,913
The most respected man is the
one who has good thoughts.

280
00:25:15,356 --> 00:25:17,216
We've elected him
as the MP of our region.

281
00:25:17,821 --> 00:25:20,329
But it was his effort that raised him
to the rank of a central minister.

282
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:23,551
You must have that sort
of a determination.

283
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:24,827
Hats off to him!

284
00:25:29,746 --> 00:25:32,318
If children wrong,
the parents are blamed.

285
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:35,562
If someone does something good,
everyone asks him where he hails from.

286
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:38,162
That's because,
from our birth to our death,

287
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,448
we might have changed
hundreds of clothes.

288
00:25:40,794 --> 00:25:43,875
But the only thing that doesn't
change is where we were born.

289
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:45,919
It is our identity.

290
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:50,707
It is our responsibility to protect it.
It is your responsibility.

291
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:54,956
I want to give you an example.

292
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:58,231
It's a story about a state in India.

293
00:25:58,469 --> 00:26:02,010
In a small village in Mahabubnagar,
a girl child was born.

294
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:03,716
Her parents were farmers

295
00:26:03,836 --> 00:26:05,939
but they couldn't even have
one proper meal a day.

296
00:26:06,556 --> 00:26:09,107
The village did not have
proper bus connectivity either.

297
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:11,778
Every day, she would ride a bicycle to
her school that was 10 kilometers away.

298
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:14,210
She would study hard and clear
the Civil Services Examination and

299
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:17,658
is right now in front of you as the
administrative officer of our district.

300
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:21,712
You should be inspired by her.

301
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:24,360
Welcome her with loud applause.

302
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:36,911
Hats off to you.

303
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:43,580
Establishing educational institutions
is not that note-worthy a feat.

304
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:46,218
Children should progress,
that's a big deal.

305
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:47,990
It's not note-worthy that you take

306
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,926
with you a degree from here
that helps only you.

307
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:54,109
What's note-worthy is when your talent
is beneficial to the society.

308
00:26:55,158 --> 00:26:58,941
Who is going to stop the cruelty that
woman are subjected to in the society?

309
00:26:59,222 --> 00:27:00,681
You must be the ones to stop it.

310
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,848
Your way of life should be
the one that stops such acts.

311
00:27:05,762 --> 00:27:07,509
Who is going to stop the people

312
00:27:07,589 --> 00:27:11,048
who divide and create chaos
in the name of caste and religion?

313
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:12,854
You should be the ones to stop them.

314
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,105
Your way of life of life
should stop it.

315
00:27:16,532 --> 00:27:18,543
All of you have
a responsibility for it.

316
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:27,236
Pure minds create
clean society and great future.

317
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:33,107
Thank you.

318
00:27:47,652 --> 00:27:50,277
Sir, we've quit the path of violence.

319
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:52,278
We are going to follow you
until our death.

320
00:28:06,872 --> 00:28:07,553
Come, ma'am.

321
00:28:10,743 --> 00:28:12,739
If you called for him,
he would've come to the office himself.

322
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:14,300
You coming all the way here...

323
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:16,700
I misunderstood him.

324
00:28:17,414 --> 00:28:19,911
I can't call him here
just to apologize. Let's go.

325
00:28:37,002 --> 00:28:39,089
Brother, she has come.

326
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:44,019
Why are you standing here?
Come in.

327
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:50,235
Place your right feet
first when you come in.

328
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,759
These people take
their customs seriously.

329
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:04,831
Come, dear.

330
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:09,156
How are your parents?
- They are well.

331
00:29:09,236 --> 00:29:12,442
I am Ramachandra.
She is my wife, Bharthi.

332
00:29:13,026 --> 00:29:13,858
Come, dear.

333
00:29:13,938 --> 00:29:15,404
Everyone come here.

334
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,581
Sit down, dear.

335
00:29:25,554 --> 00:29:28,041
How is the girl?
- She is beautiful.

336
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:29,608
We liked her very much.

337
00:29:33,868 --> 00:29:37,057
Mr. Satyamurthy, your daughter...
- Sorry, Mr. Ramachandra.

338
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:39,177
Girls of this generation
are very spoiled.

339
00:29:39,588 --> 00:29:41,123
After the sun goes down,

340
00:29:41,203 --> 00:29:43,177
wives take their husbands
to pubs and clubs.

341
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,545
My daughter isn't the
right fit for your family.

342
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,864
That is why I didn't send her.

343
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,658
Then who is she?

344
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,669
I am the District Administration Officer.

345
00:30:04,518 --> 00:30:05,491
Forgive us.

346
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,783
His friend's daughter
came down from U.S.

347
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:10,843
She was supposed to come
to our house to meet Murali Krishna.

348
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,627
If they like each other,
he wanted to get them married.

349
00:30:14,707 --> 00:30:16,108
We thought you were her.

350
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:19,167
Why did you come by?

351
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:21,642
I came to meet Mr. Murali Krishna.

352
00:30:21,722 --> 00:30:22,485
I see.

353
00:30:22,565 --> 00:30:24,279
He is outside with farmers.

354
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,339
Come, dear.

355
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,635
Manager.
- Sir.

356
00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:34,452
I put down the surety signature
on farmers loan application form.

357
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,014
Okay, sir.

358
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:36,733
Give them whatever amount
they ask as loans.

359
00:30:36,813 --> 00:30:37,413
Sure, sir.

360
00:30:37,493 --> 00:30:38,657
I am there for them.

361
00:30:39,186 --> 00:30:40,905
You are our Lord, sir.

362
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:43,889
I am one of you.
I am a part of your family.

363
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:46,094
Don't praise me and
distance yourself from me.

364
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:48,667
Let's go and have our meal together.

365
00:30:49,229 --> 00:30:50,894
I shall call him.
- No, wait.

366
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,656
He is busy. I'll meet him later.

367
00:30:55,196 --> 00:30:55,802
All right.

368
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:03,088
These documents need your signature.

369
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,131
Yesterday, I went to
Mr. Murali Krishna's house.

370
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,348
Thank you.

371
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,229
Very interesting character.

372
00:31:13,002 --> 00:31:13,899
Not just him.

373
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:15,631
After meeting his family,

374
00:31:15,711 --> 00:31:17,834
I felt their house to be the cradle
of good customs and traditions.

375
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:19,614
What's strange is that,

376
00:31:19,694 --> 00:31:21,290
there are a lot more people
flocking around his house than

377
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,398
the District Administrative Office.
- Great.

378
00:31:23,863 --> 00:31:25,701
You've made a lot of
observations in a single visit.

379
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:29,020
Ma'am, Mr. Murali Krishna
is here to meet you.

380
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:31,269
Mr. Murali Krishna?

381
00:31:32,544 --> 00:31:35,312
Wait for two minutes and send him in.
- Okay, ma'am.

382
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,744
Greetings, ma'am.

383
00:31:54,771 --> 00:31:56,620
Mr. Murali Krishna, when did you come?

384
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,301
Just two minutes ago.

385
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,252
What was the need to wait?
You could've come in directly.

386
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:05,409
Hello, ma'am. How are you?

387
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:06,587
I am well.
- Sit.

388
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,155
What brings you by?
- I am sorry.

389
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:12,231
I heard that you came
to my home yesterday.

390
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,480
The farmers from the village
dropped in at the same time.

391
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,480
I was occupied and
couldn't meet you.

392
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,080
It's not a problem.

393
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,583
But I met with your family.

394
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:21,187
I really enjoyed a lot.

395
00:32:22,652 --> 00:32:23,431
What else?

396
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:25,831
Tomorrow, there is pulse polio
immunization program at our hospital.

397
00:32:26,122 --> 00:32:27,841
If you could come over,
it would be good.

398
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,695
Sure.
- Thank you, ma'am.

399
00:32:31,311 --> 00:32:32,479
It's at 9 o'clock in the morning.

400
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,787
I shall take leave.
- Okay.

401
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,992
Isn't it we who conduct
the pulse polio immunization program?

402
00:32:38,597 --> 00:32:39,830
Why would he do that?

403
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,895
Not just schools and colleges.

404
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:44,739
He is the one who built
all the hospitals around the area.

405
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:45,625
Not just that.

406
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:48,760
The best facilities and
best doctors at free of cost.

407
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,647
All right.
You said you wanted some signatures?

408
00:32:52,113 --> 00:32:53,637
Mine lease extension file.

409
00:32:58,275 --> 00:33:00,837
Copper mine in Nallamala forest?

410
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:07,508
Isn't this a green zone?
Why would there be mining in it?

411
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:09,270
Exactly my thoughts.

412
00:33:09,476 --> 00:33:10,752
By the time I came here,

413
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:14,041
all the permissions were granted
and the Mine began to operate.

414
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,252
I think something is going wrong.

415
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:20,806
Ms. Padmavati, I want a complete
report on the activities of the Mine.

416
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:23,054
And, keep it between you and me only.

417
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:27,044
By the way, the DSP is working
for the Mine owner.

418
00:33:30,254 --> 00:33:31,540
What's the name of the Mine owner?

419
00:33:32,557 --> 00:33:34,795
Varadha Raj. Varadha Mines.

420
00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:48,858
What is it? What's going on?

421
00:33:48,938 --> 00:33:51,420
He vomited blood and passed out.
- He vomited blood?

422
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:53,301
Oh, no. He's dead.
- Stop the work.

423
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,451
Why did you stop the work

424
00:34:02,689 --> 00:34:04,765
For years,
we've been working in the Mine.

425
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,835
No matter where we worked,
nothing happened to us.

426
00:34:09,263 --> 00:34:11,739
Here, as we go deeper,
the workers are vomiting blood,

427
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:13,371
itching and have
burning sensation in the eyes.

428
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,854
Father, why get into trouble?
- Shut up.

429
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:20,013
Until we know what's happening here

430
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:21,376
we wouldn't step into the Mine.

431
00:34:43,784 --> 00:34:45,286
Anybody there?

432
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,395
Who are you?

433
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,511
My car broke in the forest.

434
00:35:02,117 --> 00:35:03,533
I am hungry.

435
00:35:03,857 --> 00:35:07,719
I see. We don't have bread.
Will you have rice?

436
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:10,108
I am okay with anything.
- All right.

437
00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:11,975
Son, get the banana leaf.
Come in.

438
00:35:25,942 --> 00:35:27,175
Did you eat?

439
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:28,959
My husband went to the city.

440
00:35:29,186 --> 00:35:30,440
I'll eat when he returns.

441
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,441
You go ahead.

442
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:53,431
Wash your hands.
It's raining outside.

443
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:06,318
I don't like to owe someone
who fed me.

444
00:36:07,723 --> 00:36:10,631
That's not necessary, sir.
- I will give you what I owe.

445
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:33,142
Why do you care
what happens in the Mine?

446
00:36:38,494 --> 00:36:41,239
Listen to me carefully.

447
00:36:42,364 --> 00:36:45,026
If someone complains of itchy eyes,

448
00:36:45,146 --> 00:36:50,936
tooth ache, vomiting blood
or make excuses to stop the work,

449
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:58,218
I will call him and
his family to my place

450
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:03,919
the food of their funeral.

451
00:37:30,356 --> 00:37:31,750
How are you?
- I am fine.

452
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,723
Please come.
- Sure.

453
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:40,583
The children seem to be disciplined.

454
00:37:40,777 --> 00:37:44,183
"Happy birthday to you."

455
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:47,934
"Happy birthday to you."

456
00:37:48,014 --> 00:37:52,810
"Happy birthday to dear ma'am."

457
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,592
"Happy birthday to you."

458
00:38:00,744 --> 00:38:03,111
Thank you so much. Love you all.
- Happy birthday to you, ma'am.

459
00:38:07,964 --> 00:38:09,208
Touched my heart.

460
00:38:11,132 --> 00:38:12,386
Hello.
- Please.

461
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,365
Take good care of the child.

462
00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:23,381
Thank you, doctor.

463
00:38:23,716 --> 00:38:25,283
Help the doctor.

464
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:30,007
Happy birthday to you.
- Thank you so much.

465
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:31,715
You made my day.

466
00:38:32,137 --> 00:38:33,088
Please come.

467
00:38:33,261 --> 00:38:34,817
Are you just going
to give me flowers?

468
00:38:35,001 --> 00:38:35,758
Is there no party?

469
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:37,131
We'll have lunch at my place today.

470
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:39,920
I asked for a party,
you invite me for a traditional feast.

471
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:42,688
What do you want, ma'am?

472
00:38:42,768 --> 00:38:43,553
Ma'am?

473
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:48,374
Listen, I am not
an administrative officer.

474
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,617
I am just Sharanya and
you are just Murali Krishna.

475
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:54,363
Today, you must not deny
any of my requests.

476
00:38:57,693 --> 00:38:59,650
Murali Krishna.
- Yes.

477
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:04,147
Let me tell you something.
I also befriend people I don't like.

478
00:39:04,396 --> 00:39:07,521
My language might seem a little rough
but I am generous.

479
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:08,764
You're okay with it, right?

480
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:14,094
By the way, are you interested in me?
- What?

481
00:39:14,174 --> 00:39:17,661
You've made me happy with the
way you introduced me on the stage.

482
00:39:17,996 --> 00:39:20,893
You made me happier today
on my birthday.

483
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:24,633
Looks like you are trying to woo me.
Am I right?

484
00:39:25,249 --> 00:39:27,087
You're look traditional in sari.

485
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,103
The way you walk is proud.

486
00:39:32,157 --> 00:39:33,670
Your words are sweet.

487
00:39:34,697 --> 00:39:36,589
I like them.

488
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:51,552
Put on the seat belt.
Life is very precious.

489
00:39:53,605 --> 00:39:54,502
Sorry.

490
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:21,919
Stop.

491
00:40:22,925 --> 00:40:25,207
What is it?
- Party.

492
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:27,790
Here?

493
00:40:31,174 --> 00:40:32,071
Come on.

494
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:42,232
Get on.

495
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:43,918
Get on?

496
00:40:45,766 --> 00:40:47,355
Perhaps it's not appropriate.

497
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:51,322
Do you think people would
recognize you here as well? Get on.

498
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:56,587
Sir! Sir, you are here.

499
00:40:57,279 --> 00:40:58,371
She...

500
00:40:58,696 --> 00:41:00,717
Even though I've got you this far,
you still seem popular.

501
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:04,858
Of course not. We are his fans,
we will never stop adoring him.

502
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,517
Sir, please let me message my
young friends that you are here.

503
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:12,545
They have come
with a lot of fun and fare.

504
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:14,048
Sir has brought his girlfriend.

505
00:41:14,128 --> 00:41:15,356
No.

506
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:17,793
Brother and sister-in-law
at toddy field.

507
00:41:18,377 --> 00:41:19,588
How is it, sister-in-law?
- Shut up!

508
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:23,058
Get on the tree. Go on, get it.

509
00:41:23,138 --> 00:41:23,815
Sir.

510
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:25,566
There are plenty. Get me one.

511
00:41:26,258 --> 00:41:29,090
She seems even more aggressive.

512
00:41:33,252 --> 00:41:35,099
Is it appropriate
to consume alcohol now?

513
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:36,193
This is not alcohol.

514
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,009
This is medicine.
This is our tradition.

515
00:41:38,226 --> 00:41:39,041
If you consume it,

516
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:41,242
your body is going to be cleansed
and your mind will cool down.

517
00:41:41,577 --> 00:41:43,263
Didn't you do this in your childhood?

518
00:41:44,604 --> 00:41:48,874
As a child,
he got into driving violence away.

519
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:49,782
Here, take it.

520
00:41:50,582 --> 00:41:51,252
Hold it.

521
00:41:51,598 --> 00:41:54,441
Sit down.
- Sit down? Where?

522
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:56,527
Just sit down.

523
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:57,954
Hold this.

524
00:41:58,542 --> 00:41:59,613
You there, give me the toddy.

525
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:18,087
Do you have some snacks?
- What do you mean snacks?

526
00:42:18,649 --> 00:42:19,849
I meant snacks.

527
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:25,136
Oh. You want snacks. Here you are.

528
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,298
Wonderful.

529
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:33,136
Lick it.

530
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:41,267
Not like that.
You must lick it like this.

531
00:42:42,164 --> 00:42:42,921
It's wonderful.

532
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:44,294
How me your tongue.

533
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,786
Wow! How well you lick, sir.

534
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:53,159
Keep licking.
She is doing a good job.

535
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,569
The discomfort in your throat
will settle down.

536
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:58,034
Drinking toddy is an art.

537
00:42:58,207 --> 00:42:59,861
I will show it to you.
Watch and learn.

538
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:01,061
Get up.

539
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:04,379
Give it to me.

540
00:43:05,071 --> 00:43:07,125
Pour it. Pour it.

541
00:43:38,768 --> 00:43:39,514
Sir.

542
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,098
This is the rare and
best quality uranium.

543
00:43:45,404 --> 00:43:47,368
The capacity of this is
that we can generate power

544
00:43:47,448 --> 00:43:50,161
required for the entire world
for a day with this sample.

545
00:43:54,377 --> 00:43:58,064
But the radiation is very high
and very dangerous, sir.

546
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,438
You are going to be the pioneer
in the market.

547
00:44:00,558 --> 00:44:01,879
No one can dethrone you.

548
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:06,895
Brother, someone’s come with a deal.

549
00:44:13,202 --> 00:44:14,272
Jagajith Chauhan.

550
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:19,461
I have businesses all over India
and they are best businesses too.

551
00:44:19,904 --> 00:44:22,023
I have my contacts
in every government.

552
00:44:22,877 --> 00:44:24,391
The top to the bottom.

553
00:44:25,602 --> 00:44:28,532
But, do you know why I am still here?

554
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,434
You have the best Mine in the country.

555
00:44:32,364 --> 00:44:34,450
I want that Mine.

556
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,967
If you've been operating this Mine all these years

557
00:44:46,087 --> 00:44:47,824
without the government's knowledge,

558
00:44:48,094 --> 00:44:49,424
I can gauge your guts.

559
00:44:50,915 --> 00:44:53,261
If you sell it to me,
you will be very happy.

560
00:44:53,726 --> 00:44:56,126
If not, you are going
to be in the headlines.

561
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:57,661
National headlines.

562
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:03,986
What is this?
- Answer.

563
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,608
My hair.

564
00:45:15,802 --> 00:45:17,272
You told me what you are.

565
00:45:17,629 --> 00:45:20,483
I am going to show you what I am.

566
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:29,078
Who do you think is behind him?

567
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,640
A person who is hungry needs food.

568
00:45:52,257 --> 00:45:54,701
A person who believes in God,
chases good karma.

569
00:45:55,198 --> 00:45:57,619
That is the philosophy of this Ashram.

570
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,144
This is the path that
my teacher has shown me.

571
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:06,917
May you endeavors be successful.

572
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:12,128
If you tear up, I will wipe your tears.

573
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:16,528
If you are in difficulties,
I will be the one taking care of you.

574
00:46:16,971 --> 00:46:20,344
If you are in trouble, I will save you.

575
00:46:20,646 --> 00:46:23,414
I am here for you.

576
00:46:23,793 --> 00:46:25,512
I am with you.

577
00:46:25,592 --> 00:46:27,317
I am close to you.

578
00:46:27,397 --> 00:46:31,414
Glory to you!

579
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,493
The sins committed at Brahma's
are destroyed at Vishnu's.

580
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:42,682
The sins committed at Vishnu's
are destroyed at Shiva's place.

581
00:46:43,072 --> 00:46:46,542
The sins committed at Shiva's
are destroyed at your teachers.

582
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:48,783
The sins committed
at your teachers are destroyed

583
00:46:48,903 --> 00:46:50,509
when everything turns into nothing.

584
00:46:50,704 --> 00:46:51,850
May it be so!

585
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,514
Baba. Greetings, baba.

586
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,552
What is the reason for your anger?

587
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,892
Your worshiper has been insulted.

588
00:47:17,687 --> 00:47:19,211
When you went and asked for the Mine,

589
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:21,903
he pulled out his hair and
placed it in your hand.

590
00:47:22,303 --> 00:47:24,984
Is that it?
- Yes.

591
00:47:25,448 --> 00:47:29,308
He threw his hair on my face.
- Is it him?

592
00:47:37,178 --> 00:47:40,291
You are great, baba. It's him.

593
00:47:40,951 --> 00:47:43,254
I want his Mine and I want him dead.

594
00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:46,972
He must die.

595
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,405
How dare you go against Varadha?

596
00:47:58,021 --> 00:47:59,783
I am the spirit.

597
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:02,226
He is my body.

598
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,318
That Mine is ours.

599
00:48:06,545 --> 00:48:07,724
Good bye.

600
00:48:18,081 --> 00:48:20,189
How are the Mine operations proceeding?

601
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:25,399
The contamination tanks are full.

602
00:48:25,479 --> 00:48:28,220
Take the bore out and
send it all back into the earth.

603
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:30,967
A bore?

604
00:48:31,302 --> 00:48:35,183
Reverse boring system.
- But it is dangerous.

605
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:47,615
Ten years ago,
we did the same thing in Bengal.

606
00:48:48,837 --> 00:48:51,648
People died.
But that didn't affect us.

607
00:48:53,172 --> 00:48:57,345
We did that in Bihar and Assam.
We will do this here as well.

608
00:48:59,443 --> 00:49:02,589
If you don't understand what happened,
half of the people will die.

609
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:07,314
If they understand what's going on and
start questioning, all of us will die.

610
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:12,795
Varadha Raj, once upon a time,
this country gave me something.

611
00:49:13,335 --> 00:49:18,016
I am going to return its charity
a hundred-fold. With your support.

612
00:49:29,898 --> 00:49:32,558
Two people can earn a lot of money.

613
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:34,038
Their customs and traditions
might bring them closer.

614
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,681
But when their aspirations match,
it is indeed very rare.

615
00:49:39,983 --> 00:49:41,735
But I could see that light
in our journey.

616
00:49:43,637 --> 00:49:44,805
Let's walk together.

617
00:49:50,156 --> 00:49:53,269
My parents might ask you to marry me.
Your parents might agree as well.

618
00:49:53,496 --> 00:49:55,853
But your opinion is important for me.

619
00:50:00,362 --> 00:50:01,551
Shall we get married?

620
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:26,341
"My beloved, I have chosen you."

621
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:30,330
"My beloved."

622
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:34,210
"I have started to dream about you."

623
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:41,532
"I have fallen in love
ever since our eyes met."

624
00:50:41,652 --> 00:50:48,837
"I fell in love with you
at the very first sight."

625
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:56,329
"I have surrendered myself to you."

626
00:50:56,599 --> 00:51:03,988
"You reside in my heart now."

627
00:51:04,068 --> 00:51:07,811
"My beloved."

628
00:51:07,891 --> 00:51:11,260
"I have chosen you."

629
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:15,314
"My beloved."

630
00:51:15,394 --> 00:51:19,033
"I have started to dream about you."

631
00:52:02,859 --> 00:52:06,473
"You are my first love."

632
00:52:06,593 --> 00:52:10,113
"You are my first acceptance."

633
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:17,032
"I can't think of anything else
other than you."

634
00:52:17,112 --> 00:52:24,600
"You are my love."

635
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:31,723
"You brought happiness into my life."

636
00:52:32,112 --> 00:52:35,907
"You are my evening."

637
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:39,279
"You are my world."

638
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:43,383
"You are the reason

639
00:52:43,463 --> 00:52:47,167
for my life."

640
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,875
"My love."

641
00:52:50,955 --> 00:52:54,410
"I have chosen you."

642
00:52:54,490 --> 00:53:02,400
"My beloved, I have started
to dream about you."

643
00:53:34,606 --> 00:53:38,325
"You are my world,
you are my happiness."

644
00:53:38,405 --> 00:53:41,784
"You are my existence."

645
00:53:41,864 --> 00:53:49,048
"I are always on my mind."

646
00:53:49,128 --> 00:53:56,388
"I am fortunate to marry you."

647
00:53:56,468 --> 00:54:03,211
"Be my life partner
in all my lifetimes."

648
00:54:03,979 --> 00:54:11,309
"I have surrendered myself to you."

649
00:54:11,389 --> 00:54:18,952
"You reside in my heart now."

650
00:54:19,032 --> 00:54:26,022
"My beloved, I have chosen you."

651
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:34,227
"My beloved, I have started
to dream about you."

652
00:54:43,772 --> 00:54:44,637
Greetings, baba.

653
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:51,903
My granddaughter
is now three years old.

654
00:54:52,476 --> 00:54:53,697
I would like your blessings.

655
00:55:08,173 --> 00:55:09,503
Go back.

656
00:55:27,287 --> 00:55:30,617
Lord the destroyer.
What is the meaning of this?

657
00:55:31,438 --> 00:55:33,243
Go! Go, fast!
- Yes, doctor.

658
00:55:33,557 --> 00:55:36,562
Take all of them inside. Be quick.
- Take all of them inside.

659
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:38,875
Sir, you need to come
to the hospital immediately.

660
00:55:39,394 --> 00:55:41,038
We have many patients.
Please be quick.

661
00:55:48,172 --> 00:55:50,864
Come with me. This way.
- Calamity has befallen.

662
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:52,875
All right. Hold on.

663
00:55:52,955 --> 00:55:54,821
I am looking into it.
Everything will be all right.

664
00:55:54,901 --> 00:55:56,540
Look what has happened.

665
00:55:59,015 --> 00:56:00,215
Hold it.
- Look what has happened.

666
00:56:00,594 --> 00:56:01,729
Be quick.

667
00:56:14,545 --> 00:56:17,180
Be quick. Take the stretcher.
We have more children.

668
00:56:20,268 --> 00:56:25,522
Sir. What's going on, sir?

669
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:29,749
How can a just born be in such a state?

670
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,208
What happened, doctor?
- I don't understand, sir.

671
00:56:34,435 --> 00:56:35,224
What?

672
00:56:36,132 --> 00:56:37,877
We're unable to figure out

673
00:56:37,997 --> 00:56:40,187
if this is a virus or poison
or some chemical effect.

674
00:56:40,267 --> 00:56:42,078
Each of these patients
don't have just one organ damage.

675
00:56:42,158 --> 00:56:43,830
They have multiple organ damages.

676
00:56:44,252 --> 00:56:46,479
They are not responding
to any medication.

677
00:56:47,182 --> 00:56:48,674
They are little kids, sir.

678
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:50,728
They are unable to take it.

679
00:56:52,371 --> 00:56:55,809
What the hell is happening?

680
00:57:03,704 --> 00:57:04,612
Where are you?

681
00:57:04,828 --> 00:57:06,417
I am heading to the airport,
there's meeting in Delhi.

682
00:57:06,497 --> 00:57:08,266
Start immediately and
come to the hospital.

683
00:57:08,346 --> 00:57:09,423
Turn the vehicle around.

684
00:57:09,503 --> 00:57:12,147
All these people belong
to the neighboring villages.

685
00:57:13,293 --> 00:57:14,363
What happened there?

686
00:57:14,861 --> 00:57:16,212
That is a tribal area, sir.

687
00:57:16,292 --> 00:57:18,082
Viral diseases such as these
are pretty common there.

688
00:57:18,162 --> 00:57:19,671
This isn't a viral attack, sir.

689
00:57:20,633 --> 00:57:22,569
These people are tribal,

690
00:57:22,763 --> 00:57:24,709
if don't practice good hygiene,
diseases...

691
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:27,022
Tribal?

692
00:57:27,102 --> 00:57:29,801
Murali, calm down.

693
00:57:31,098 --> 00:57:32,579
There is a small copper mine
in that area.

694
00:57:32,659 --> 00:57:33,898
Do you think they would
be affected that?

695
00:57:34,126 --> 00:57:35,801
That is not a copper mine, sir.

696
00:57:41,986 --> 00:57:43,953
It is just a copper mine in name.

697
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:47,034
But Uranium is being
extracted from there.

698
00:57:49,672 --> 00:57:50,893
Uranium?

699
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,185
My God!

700
00:57:59,715 --> 00:58:01,423
Don't make unfounded
allegations, Ms. Padmavati.

701
00:58:01,617 --> 00:58:02,915
It's a complicated matter.

702
00:58:02,995 --> 00:58:03,758
Shut up!

703
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:06,894
Complicated? For whom?

704
00:58:07,585 --> 00:58:10,450
For you or for Varadha Raj?

705
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:15,466
This is the report compiled after
procuring data for three years.

706
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:17,097
When ma'am talked about this,

707
00:58:17,177 --> 00:58:18,723
I had started my investigation.

708
00:58:18,803 --> 00:58:20,010
I took a lot of risk.

709
00:58:20,226 --> 00:58:23,160
With the use of satellite sensors
and fiber optic probes,

710
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,102
we collected samples from the mines.

711
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:26,540
I knew that they would be
compromised here.

712
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,486
So, I got it tested
in a laboratory in Mumbai.

713
00:58:28,566 --> 00:58:30,399
Do you know what they found out, sir?

714
00:58:30,713 --> 00:58:32,994
Copper exists only up to
the depth of fifty feet.

715
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:37,092
Below that, all of it is Uranium, sir.

716
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:43,978
They extract it there, purify it there

717
00:58:44,058 --> 00:58:46,968
and dug holes into the ground

718
00:58:47,048 --> 00:58:50,670
and used reverse boring to send
it back into the earth, sir.

719
00:59:07,307 --> 00:59:10,139
This horror is a result
of such activities.

720
00:59:15,697 --> 00:59:17,697
These are just early effects, sir.

721
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,394
If something is not done quickly,

722
00:59:21,621 --> 00:59:25,761
our region and our country
would turn into graveyard.

723
00:59:26,303 --> 00:59:27,503
Mark my words.

724
00:59:27,816 --> 00:59:28,746
Doctor,

725
00:59:29,578 --> 00:59:33,449
arrange for medicines and
equipments required to save them.

726
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:35,794
Where is that Mine?

727
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,182
This is my empire.

728
01:02:58,636 --> 01:02:59,858
I am going to turn it into ruins.

729
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:05,058
I am the other name for death.
- I am your death.

730
01:03:05,138 --> 01:03:07,447
I am destruction.
- I am catastrophe.

731
01:03:07,527 --> 01:03:11,263
You can't touch me.
- I will destroy you.

732
01:03:11,343 --> 01:03:14,863
I am an animal.
- I am the lion that hunts that animal.

733
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:38,955
Come at me!

734
01:03:39,442 --> 01:03:40,923
You meddled with the soil.

735
01:03:41,302 --> 01:03:43,334
You killed the animals
that provide us with milk.

736
01:03:43,507 --> 01:03:45,496
You meddled with
the life-giving waters.

737
01:03:45,767 --> 01:03:47,777
You killed innocent people.

738
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:50,264
I will kill you.

739
01:03:51,605 --> 01:03:52,524
Calm down.

740
01:03:52,924 --> 01:03:54,675
Respect.

741
01:03:54,755 --> 01:03:55,789
Respect?

742
01:03:56,405 --> 01:03:58,632
Respect comes from behavior;
not by begging.

743
01:04:00,805 --> 01:04:03,540
You have locked horns
with Anthapur Varadha Raj.

744
01:04:04,697 --> 01:04:07,529
If you were born in Anthapur,
I was born in Anantapur.

745
01:04:07,972 --> 01:04:10,502
If I decide what is wrong and right,

746
01:04:10,582 --> 01:04:12,718
I never spare the one
who crosses my way.

747
01:04:13,129 --> 01:04:16,188
I send the funeral food
of my enemy to his house.

748
01:04:16,447 --> 01:04:17,787
With his head.

749
01:04:17,867 --> 01:04:19,312
You will behead me?

750
01:04:19,392 --> 01:04:22,414
Once I decide to step into the fray,
I am like a bulldozer without brakes.

751
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:23,506
I will crush you.

752
01:04:23,711 --> 01:04:24,801
Whether left or right, top or bottom,

753
01:04:24,921 --> 01:04:26,630
no matter from where
anyone searches you,

754
01:04:26,846 --> 01:04:29,636
not an inch of your body
will ever be found again.

755
01:04:29,992 --> 01:04:30,954
Come at me!

756
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:31,971
Come at me!

757
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:35,841
Mr. Murali, please.

758
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,570
Where would he and this mine go?

759
01:04:37,819 --> 01:04:39,008
We will shut it down in an hour.

760
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:40,857
The situation at the hospital
is taking a downturn. Please.

761
01:04:41,841 --> 01:04:45,797
If even a single life is lost there,
you will no longer be alive.

762
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,133
Listen to me.
The minister is with him.

763
01:04:50,641 --> 01:04:54,264
The Administrative officer
has collected proof against us.

764
01:04:54,384 --> 01:04:55,467
This isn't the right time.

765
01:04:56,046 --> 01:04:58,057
Listen to me. Calm down.

766
01:04:58,923 --> 01:05:00,955
Sir, he is someone
who does simple quarry mining

767
01:05:01,593 --> 01:05:03,809
is using such a high-end equipment,
that means

768
01:05:04,447 --> 01:05:05,852
that there is a bigger force at play.

769
01:05:05,932 --> 01:05:07,020
Please give me some time, sir.

770
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:08,306
I'll bring all the information to light.

771
01:05:08,386 --> 01:05:09,420
You must.

772
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,144
If not, a lot of future generations
will be lost.

773
01:05:12,224 --> 01:05:15,129
As long as you are here,
I am not scared, sir.

774
01:05:26,588 --> 01:05:27,593
Don't be scared.

775
01:05:27,766 --> 01:05:28,880
I will make sure
not a single life is lost.

776
01:05:29,074 --> 01:05:31,334
And also make sure that the Mine
doesn't operate anymore.

777
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:34,696
Murali!

778
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:45,593
Father, what happened to her?

779
01:05:45,673 --> 01:05:48,026
She passed out while she was playing.

780
01:05:48,675 --> 01:05:50,264
She hasn't opened her eyes until now.

781
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:52,328
Doctor!

782
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:55,521
Bharat.

783
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:58,937
Bharat.

784
01:07:08,386 --> 01:07:11,283
'As long as you are here,
I am not scared, sir.'

785
01:07:13,553 --> 01:07:15,585
Not a single person was left alive.

786
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:18,061
Not a single one.

787
01:07:22,407 --> 01:07:25,791
Varadha, did the blood flow like flood?

788
01:07:28,212 --> 01:07:32,299
The dead bodies and
morsels of meat scattered?

789
01:07:37,368 --> 01:07:41,584
There was a loss in sense of direction
with the drums of death beating hard.

790
01:07:45,584 --> 01:07:48,762
How do you know about it?

791
01:07:49,389 --> 01:07:51,833
Do you think the one who created
it wouldn't know about it?

792
01:07:54,752 --> 01:07:55,714
What do we do now?

793
01:07:55,794 --> 01:07:59,703
We need someone to pin this sin on.
Leave it to me.

794
01:08:07,346 --> 01:08:11,540
Krishnamacharya Perumal,
NIA, New Delhi.

795
01:08:13,455 --> 01:08:15,173
The one who died
was a central minister.

796
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:17,952
The bomb blast occurred
at your hospital.

797
01:08:18,687 --> 01:08:20,168
You are under arrest.

798
01:08:26,968 --> 01:08:28,265
On what charges?

799
01:08:29,476 --> 01:08:33,130
You, being the wife of an accused,
you have no rights to question.

800
01:08:33,336 --> 01:08:34,957
And you are also under suspension.

801
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:49,563
To find out the truth,
you need to come with me. Shall we go?

802
01:08:49,643 --> 01:08:52,439
You are going to arrest him?
Let's see you do it.

803
01:08:54,417 --> 01:08:56,288
There are already a lot of lives lost.

804
01:08:57,477 --> 01:08:58,915
Do we need one more?

805
01:09:15,173 --> 01:09:17,681
Until yesterday, whatever happened
in the Mine was a secret.

806
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,508
Now, it's out in the open.

807
01:09:19,962 --> 01:09:23,356
All those who let the secret out
and those who've supported it

808
01:09:23,436 --> 01:09:26,319
and the villages that stand as evidence
should no longer exist.

809
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,545
Before the victims come towards us,
finish them all.

810
01:10:06,816 --> 01:10:09,637
You killed the children and the elders.

811
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:11,983
What more can you do?

812
01:10:12,063 --> 01:10:14,102
Kill us!

813
01:10:14,182 --> 01:10:16,405
Kill us!

814
01:11:10,427 --> 01:11:13,259
Highly advanced plastic explosives.

815
01:11:13,865 --> 01:11:16,146
It's a small rural area.

816
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:20,200
This is the first time in the state.
I'm surprised.

817
01:11:20,968 --> 01:11:23,195
The minister came
because you phoned him.

818
01:11:23,736 --> 01:11:25,044
As per phone records.

819
01:11:27,704 --> 01:11:29,476
He came to your hospital.

820
01:11:30,925 --> 01:11:32,266
There is technical evidence.

821
01:11:34,903 --> 01:11:36,968
Surprisingly, until then
you were with him.

822
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:40,460
But, at the time of the blast,
you moved to a safe zone.

823
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:41,325
How come?

824
01:11:44,503 --> 01:11:46,692
Mr. Murali, I need to know
why you killed

825
01:11:46,812 --> 01:11:48,839
the minister and
so many innocent people.

826
01:11:52,623 --> 01:11:54,914
Silence will not change the truth.

827
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:04,795
If you don't say anything, believe me

828
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,919
all your routes and gates
will be closed forever.

829
01:12:09,336 --> 01:12:10,795
No one can save you.

830
01:12:14,135 --> 01:12:15,465
Ma'am, the condition is serious.

831
01:12:19,054 --> 01:12:21,530
The child has been in an unconscious
state for a long time.

832
01:12:22,146 --> 01:12:24,860
If she doesn't regain consciousness,
it is going to be dangerous.

833
01:12:25,454 --> 01:12:27,054
We have to immediately
shift her to Delhi.

834
01:12:27,746 --> 01:12:29,000
How can we go, doctor?

835
01:12:30,004 --> 01:12:32,977
Look at how the police have
surrounded the entire house.

836
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:34,210
Mr. Ramachandra,

837
01:12:35,734 --> 01:12:38,978
if Mr. Murali was here,
he'd risk his life to save the child.

838
01:12:39,691 --> 01:12:41,908
We can't do the same for his kid?

839
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:44,264
Let's go.
Let's see who is going to stop us.

840
01:13:36,136 --> 01:13:38,201
No matter what happens,
don't get down from the vehicle.

841
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:54,751
The Mr. Murali's wife is in the car.
Save her.

842
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:08,872
Go.

843
01:14:09,887 --> 01:14:11,217
Move fast.

844
01:14:39,694 --> 01:14:40,926
Don't be scared.

845
01:14:42,493 --> 01:14:43,661
Nothing is going to happen to you.

846
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:45,639
I'll take care of it.

847
01:14:56,882 --> 01:14:59,271
Hold the steering wheel.

848
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,930
Ma'am, the child...

849
01:15:28,546 --> 01:15:29,638
Ma'am!

850
01:15:31,941 --> 01:15:32,957
Ma'am!

851
01:15:55,702 --> 01:15:57,594
Janvi...

852
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:01,626
My child.

853
01:16:04,318 --> 01:16:07,204
Sorry. I am sorry.

854
01:16:55,462 --> 01:16:56,662
Janvi.

855
01:16:58,564 --> 01:17:00,910
My child.

856
01:17:09,429 --> 01:17:12,672
She is here somewhere.
Let's find her.

857
01:17:33,144 --> 01:17:35,036
My child!

858
01:17:44,941 --> 01:17:46,530
Lord!

859
01:17:48,162 --> 01:17:50,649
Lord!

860
01:17:50,729 --> 01:17:53,654
(Chants)

861
01:17:53,734 --> 01:17:59,113
(Chants)

862
01:17:59,363 --> 01:18:02,465
(Chants)

863
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:05,135
(Chants)

864
01:18:05,215 --> 01:18:08,054
(Chants)

865
01:18:08,134 --> 01:18:10,788
(Chants)

866
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:28,701
Where else can she go?
Kill her and her daughter.

867
01:18:29,133 --> 01:18:33,624
May you live long!

868
01:18:33,704 --> 01:18:36,257
(Chants)

869
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:43,209
(Chants)

870
01:19:50,431 --> 01:19:54,323
(Chants)

871
01:19:54,755 --> 01:19:57,090
(Chants)

872
01:19:57,566 --> 01:19:59,933
(Chants)

873
01:21:21,748 --> 01:21:26,948
(Chants)

874
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:32,462
(Chants)

875
01:22:16,451 --> 01:22:17,575
Who are you?

876
01:22:17,655 --> 01:22:19,618
The one with sun,
moon and fire in his eyes.

877
01:22:20,418 --> 01:22:22,029
The rider of the white bull, Nandi.

878
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:24,970
The one who wears a snake
around his neck.

879
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:27,391
The savior who protects by
destroying the Tripura demon.

880
01:22:28,256 --> 01:22:30,969
I am Lord Shiva!

881
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,420
Who are you?

882
01:22:51,739 --> 01:22:53,847
This body is eternal and abundant.

883
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:57,825
My form is never
ending and imperishable.

884
01:22:58,009 --> 01:22:59,231
I am Shiva.

885
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,618
The sound of the conch that I
heard isn't an ordinary one.

886
01:23:28,202 --> 01:23:32,829
The power that shook me up and
my throne is no ordinary thing.

887
01:23:34,439 --> 01:23:37,661
The one that I saw
is no ordinary being.

888
01:23:39,434 --> 01:23:40,893
Who is it?

889
01:23:41,823 --> 01:23:46,321
'You must never challenge your fate,
the creator and the entire world.'

890
01:23:46,743 --> 01:23:50,181
'The response they give you is
something you cannot handle.'

891
01:23:50,894 --> 01:23:51,932
Tatva.

892
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,494
The throne has been contaminated.

893
01:23:58,797 --> 01:24:01,424
Shift the base to Ananthapur.

894
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:08,084
Who is he?

895
01:24:08,473 --> 01:24:14,267
(Chants)

896
01:24:31,196 --> 01:24:32,050
He is alive.

897
01:24:36,709 --> 01:24:41,552
What happened? Who did all this?
Answer me.

898
01:24:57,381 --> 01:24:59,262
You want to know what happened.

899
01:24:59,342 --> 01:25:00,354
The divine dance.

900
01:25:00,549 --> 01:25:03,014
The divine dance of lord Shiva.

901
01:25:03,284 --> 01:25:07,814
The one who killed them
is not an ordinary being.

902
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:09,241
It's Lord Shiva.

903
01:25:10,982 --> 01:25:14,419
He didn't send you dead bodies.

904
01:25:15,057 --> 01:25:17,576
He sent you a sign that he has come.

905
01:25:20,138 --> 01:25:22,095
You have come to his notice,

906
01:25:22,215 --> 01:25:25,741
he is destroyer of sins and
an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva.

907
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:30,104
If you play with the life of a child,
will the divine one spare you?

908
01:25:31,078 --> 01:25:34,181
The third eye has been opened.

909
01:25:34,261 --> 01:25:35,920
You will surely die.

910
01:25:41,877 --> 01:25:44,007
Baba has moved Ananthapur.

911
01:25:46,114 --> 01:25:49,260
Join him, I'll be there too.

912
01:25:53,422 --> 01:25:55,492
I am saying this as
your younger brother.

913
01:25:55,612 --> 01:25:57,412
Have faith in me.

914
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:00,569
Go on.

915
01:26:13,238 --> 01:26:16,183
You defeated everything that
came in your way, but you lost today.

916
01:26:16,303 --> 01:26:18,114
He is a definitely a powerful man.

917
01:26:20,351 --> 01:26:24,449
I will find out who defeated you.

918
01:26:24,795 --> 01:26:28,417
Until then,
keep the fire in your heart burning.

919
01:26:28,773 --> 01:26:31,779
I will tell you who you
should burn in that fire.

920
01:26:32,827 --> 01:26:34,939
The devotees are waiting.

921
01:26:35,059 --> 01:26:37,832
Go perform your brother's last rites.

922
01:26:40,697 --> 01:26:42,189
Who are you?

923
01:26:43,604 --> 01:26:49,194
Adoration to Lord Shiva.

924
01:26:52,318 --> 01:26:54,145
May you live long.

925
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:07,832
"Lord Shiva is present
in every particle of earth."

926
01:27:08,177 --> 01:27:13,194
"Lord Shiva is present in the wind."

927
01:27:13,274 --> 01:27:18,858
"Lord Shiva is responsible
for the burning fire."

928
01:27:19,096 --> 01:27:24,588
"Lord Shiva is present
in every drop of water."

929
01:27:24,708 --> 01:27:29,971
"Lord Shiva lives even in the sky."

930
01:27:30,051 --> 01:27:33,863
"Lord Shiva present
even in the five elements."

931
01:27:33,943 --> 01:27:37,582
"Lord Shiva is present
in the five syllables."

932
01:27:37,662 --> 01:27:42,555
"Lord Shiva, protect everyone."

933
01:27:42,922 --> 01:27:48,004
"Lord Shiva is the removal of obstacles,
an ascetic."

934
01:27:48,501 --> 01:27:52,879
"Hail Lord Shiva,
You are furious."

935
01:27:52,959 --> 01:27:57,020
"You are the Lord of the world."

936
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:00,414
"Lord Shiva, You are the Lord
of the universe."

937
01:28:00,494 --> 01:28:04,273
"Ease our problems."

938
01:28:04,353 --> 01:28:07,452
"The protector of the world."

939
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:11,376
"You are omniscient and great."

940
01:28:11,456 --> 01:28:14,829
"The protector of the world."

941
01:28:14,909 --> 01:28:19,224
"You are omniscient and great."

942
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:32,250
You had been to the hospital.
How come you came back immediately?

943
01:28:33,277 --> 01:28:34,045
What happened, dear?

944
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:35,980
What happened?
What are these injuries?

945
01:28:36,434 --> 01:28:37,656
How did you suffer injuries?

946
01:28:45,407 --> 01:28:46,704
Then who saved you?

947
01:28:46,953 --> 01:28:47,904
Baba.

948
01:29:04,987 --> 01:29:08,111
Forty people died because of you.

949
01:29:10,771 --> 01:29:13,495
We need to investigate,
come to the police station.

950
01:29:28,511 --> 01:29:30,738
Her husband killed hundreds
of people using bombs

951
01:29:30,818 --> 01:29:33,787
just to cover up the crime
that he committed.

952
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:39,105
He killed forty people
because they attacked you.

953
01:29:41,505 --> 01:29:44,424
You look beautiful
even after getting married.

954
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:45,905
Mind your tongue.

955
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:52,114
I will say what I want to say.

956
01:29:52,234 --> 01:29:54,676
If anyone intervenes,
I am going to cut his tongue.

957
01:29:54,796 --> 01:29:57,721
You old hog.
- Sir, this is wrong.

958
01:29:57,948 --> 01:30:01,040
They are a very reputable family.
She is an ex-collector.

959
01:30:01,311 --> 01:30:03,959
Why are you physically assaulting them?
Your behavior is not correct, sir.

960
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:06,684
Is it?

961
01:30:08,434 --> 01:30:09,666
Then, what's right?

962
01:30:10,748 --> 01:30:11,613
Tell me.

963
01:30:14,630 --> 01:30:17,895
Do you want me to worship them?

964
01:30:19,755 --> 01:30:22,641
You want me to serve them biryani?

965
01:30:23,441 --> 01:30:24,943
How will we know the truth?

966
01:30:25,959 --> 01:30:27,322
How can we find out the truth?

967
01:30:27,527 --> 01:30:31,992
The sage said that if you abuse a child,
God won't spare you.

968
01:30:37,062 --> 01:30:38,208
Then, I won't abuse the child,

969
01:30:38,424 --> 01:30:39,516
let's just kill her.

970
01:30:41,322 --> 01:30:42,133
No!

971
01:30:42,305 --> 01:30:43,570
What are you doing?

972
01:31:07,245 --> 01:31:10,900
(Chants)

973
01:31:12,975 --> 01:31:16,629
(Chants)

974
01:31:24,348 --> 01:31:29,407
(Chants)

975
01:31:30,056 --> 01:31:35,127
(Chants)

976
01:31:39,483 --> 01:31:41,212
Is it this fellow? Is it him?

977
01:31:41,292 --> 01:31:41,947
It's me.

978
01:31:42,027 --> 01:31:44,942
(Chants)

979
01:31:45,022 --> 01:31:47,634
(Chants)

980
01:31:47,714 --> 01:31:50,606
(Chants)

981
01:31:50,686 --> 01:31:54,833
(Chants)

982
01:31:54,913 --> 01:31:57,914
(Chants)

983
01:31:57,994 --> 01:32:00,898
(Chants)

984
01:32:39,405 --> 01:32:40,454
It's me.

985
01:32:42,562 --> 01:32:44,886
The one who saved them...
- It's me.

986
01:32:45,427 --> 01:32:47,762
The one the sage was talking about...
- It's me.

987
01:32:48,497 --> 01:32:50,842
The one who killed so many people...
- It's me.

988
01:32:57,706 --> 01:32:58,539
It's me.

989
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,279
It's me.

990
01:33:17,922 --> 01:33:19,566
It's me.

991
01:33:31,309 --> 01:33:35,011
(Chants)

992
01:33:35,091 --> 01:33:36,693
(Chants)

993
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:41,029
(Chants)

994
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:42,932
Kill him!

995
01:33:50,682 --> 01:33:54,141
I don't know if one can meet God
after performing a severe penance.

996
01:33:54,909 --> 01:33:58,974
But when the lives of children
are in danger,

997
01:33:59,449 --> 01:34:01,903
when innocent people are troubled,

998
01:34:02,228 --> 01:34:05,287
Lord will definitely come there.

999
01:34:05,741 --> 01:34:06,877
Baba.

1000
01:34:09,612 --> 01:34:12,260
All the sins that you've listed
out have happened right here.

1001
01:34:12,693 --> 01:34:14,185
Sit down.

1002
01:34:15,686 --> 01:34:17,600
All this happened right
in front of my eyes.

1003
01:34:17,827 --> 01:34:19,341
But God didn't appear.

1004
01:34:19,546 --> 01:34:20,724
How will He come?

1005
01:34:20,984 --> 01:34:23,536
As long as you resist,
God will never appear.

1006
01:34:23,871 --> 01:34:27,590
When you let go of your
ego, strength and pride,

1007
01:34:27,773 --> 01:34:31,211
and succumb to the mightiness
of the God,

1008
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:35,049
and scream until your throat turns raw,
that God is your only rescue,

1009
01:34:35,547 --> 01:34:38,433
that is when God will appear to you.

1010
01:34:45,006 --> 01:34:47,633
God!

1011
01:35:19,946 --> 01:35:21,514
Save me, baba.

1012
01:35:23,211 --> 01:35:26,141
As a God, I command you. Let him go!

1013
01:35:43,451 --> 01:35:44,554
(Chants)

1014
01:35:49,191 --> 01:35:50,121
(Chants)

1015
01:35:56,574 --> 01:35:58,693
If you say a word,
it becomes a sound.

1016
01:35:59,244 --> 01:36:01,179
But if I say a word,
it becomes a command.

1017
01:36:01,579 --> 01:36:03,331
A divine command.

1018
01:36:05,989 --> 01:36:11,805
Baba, you are right. God is here.

1019
01:36:12,356 --> 01:36:15,719
Praise be with you!

1020
01:36:18,670 --> 01:36:21,178
May the entire population
of the world prosper.

1021
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,535
Other than him.

1022
01:36:25,909 --> 01:36:27,152
(Chants)

1023
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:29,303
Hey!

1024
01:36:37,605 --> 01:36:42,297
Praise be with Lord Shiva!

1025
01:36:43,833 --> 01:36:46,654
You are a pig that changed its
colors in front of a raging bull.

1026
01:36:46,734 --> 01:36:49,605
If you speak nonsense,
I will behead you.

1027
01:37:01,042 --> 01:37:06,641
(Chants)

1028
01:37:06,721 --> 01:37:09,344
(Chants)

1029
01:37:09,424 --> 01:37:11,798
There is another cruel man
named Varadha Raj.

1030
01:37:11,878 --> 01:37:15,338
When his name burns,
his life will burn too.

1031
01:37:16,235 --> 01:37:17,954
He is your son.

1032
01:37:23,251 --> 01:37:25,120
That day, it was decided
by Lord Shiva

1033
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,294
that I must separate
your child from you.

1034
01:37:27,374 --> 01:37:30,073
Now, he returns to you
at the behest of your grandchild.

1035
01:37:30,193 --> 01:37:31,759
This is Lord Shiva's will.

1036
01:37:32,257 --> 01:37:36,365
What? Did God order you
to separate a child from his mother?

1037
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:39,457
When you know everything,

1038
01:37:40,041 --> 01:37:43,090
is separating me from
my child justified?

1039
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:47,923
Your son was born for a purpose.

1040
01:37:50,333 --> 01:37:54,474
He is the part of the creator
of the world, Brahma.

1041
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:56,939
He was born from your womb.

1042
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:01,263
As soon as he was born,
Lord Shiva severed your relationships

1043
01:38:01,343 --> 01:38:03,566
and called him towards Him.

1044
01:38:05,090 --> 01:38:05,911
What is the reason?

1045
01:38:06,193 --> 01:38:08,488
There is a brute that killed a great man

1046
01:38:08,568 --> 01:38:12,985
and committed the first wrongdoing
by questioning Tripurari.

1047
01:38:20,466 --> 01:38:25,299
He's played with the nature and
committed the second grave mistake.

1048
01:38:34,585 --> 01:38:37,119
He killed innocent children, people and

1049
01:38:37,239 --> 01:38:39,461
committed an unforgivable
third mistake.

1050
01:38:46,174 --> 01:38:50,044
That is why Lord Shiva blew the
divine conch and began the war.

1051
01:38:52,196 --> 01:38:57,298
No matter the reason for his birth,
I am the mother who gave him birth.

1052
01:38:59,038 --> 01:39:01,741
I want my son. That's my right.

1053
01:39:03,082 --> 01:39:06,358
I will ask him.

1054
01:39:11,634 --> 01:39:13,234
It's God's will.

1055
01:39:15,342 --> 01:39:16,899
Baba.

1056
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,611
I am your mother.

1057
01:39:35,659 --> 01:39:40,675
You are my son, I birthed you
and I didn't know that.

1058
01:39:41,497 --> 01:39:43,616
Lord Shiva asked for you
and you were given away.

1059
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:45,021
How unjust!

1060
01:39:47,432 --> 01:39:49,496
When a mother knows that
her child is in front of her,

1061
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:51,000
how can she stop herself?

1062
01:39:53,919 --> 01:39:54,860
Look at me.

1063
01:39:55,487 --> 01:39:57,919
Turn around and
take a look at your mother.

1064
01:40:00,125 --> 01:40:02,719
You are my blood. You are my child.

1065
01:40:05,043 --> 01:40:08,265
SANSKRIT

1066
01:40:08,513 --> 01:40:11,043
SANSKRIT

1067
01:40:12,605 --> 01:40:14,865
In this lifetime,
Lord Shiva is my father.

1068
01:40:15,524 --> 01:40:17,081
That divine mother
is my only mother.

1069
01:40:25,729 --> 01:40:27,535
This breath, this voice and this body...

1070
01:40:30,929 --> 01:40:32,453
I am His slave.

1071
01:40:34,572 --> 01:40:35,989
This life is dedicated to Lord Shiva.

1072
01:40:36,627 --> 01:40:38,108
My next life will be
the command of Lord Shiva.

1073
01:41:07,417 --> 01:41:09,666
I would only get
to hear your words.

1074
01:41:09,746 --> 01:41:11,330
Now, I see that you've come here.

1075
01:41:11,601 --> 01:41:12,271
What is the matter?

1076
01:41:17,784 --> 01:41:21,568
(Chants)

1077
01:41:21,795 --> 01:41:23,817
(Chants)

1078
01:41:34,951 --> 01:41:35,957
Akhanda!

1079
01:41:36,368 --> 01:41:37,827
Do you know him?

1080
01:41:37,907 --> 01:41:40,584
He is Akhanda Rudhra Sikander Ghora.

1081
01:41:41,957 --> 01:41:46,217
He killed my teacher and
my followers ruthlessly.

1082
01:41:51,417 --> 01:41:53,515
He isn't an ordinary man.

1083
01:41:53,595 --> 01:41:55,002
He is a great transcendental being

1084
01:41:55,122 --> 01:41:57,364
who has kept the seven chakras
of the body in great control.

1085
01:41:57,537 --> 01:41:59,807
Even the five elements of nature
are under his control.

1086
01:42:00,013 --> 01:42:01,624
They are scared to touch him.

1087
01:42:01,704 --> 01:42:03,040
They bow to him.

1088
01:42:05,278 --> 01:42:07,386
Even the cold that
can harden the blood and

1089
01:42:07,466 --> 01:42:09,233
also the fire that melts the blood

1090
01:42:09,313 --> 01:42:10,715
can never touch him.

1091
01:42:11,017 --> 01:42:13,071
Time is their slave.

1092
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,578
All the mantras are
merely their directions.

1093
01:42:17,654 --> 01:42:20,182
For the sake of the blessing that says

1094
01:42:20,302 --> 01:42:22,843
'May all the beings
in the world prosper'.

1095
01:42:23,168 --> 01:42:24,725
They can do anything.

1096
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:27,125
and if need be,
they would even fight a war.

1097
01:42:27,205 --> 01:42:31,189
Prachanda, you know why I've
come to you and you tell me this?

1098
01:42:31,503 --> 01:42:32,735
I will kill him.

1099
01:42:34,616 --> 01:42:38,465
What are you scared of in this world?
- Death.

1100
01:42:38,757 --> 01:42:40,800
Death fears him.

1101
01:42:44,108 --> 01:42:46,844
When I call only ghosts answer my call.

1102
01:42:47,124 --> 01:42:50,314
When he calls,
the Lord of ghosts answers his call.

1103
01:42:51,697 --> 01:42:54,033
But why did we cross paths?

1104
01:42:54,113 --> 01:42:56,486
He was born for you.

1105
01:42:56,566 --> 01:42:59,286
He took up weapon for you.

1106
01:43:01,193 --> 01:43:05,712
This is the game Lord Shiva played
while taking the shape of a small child.

1107
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:12,145
I am indebted to you.

1108
01:43:12,912 --> 01:43:15,102
I will leave only after
I solve your crisis.

1109
01:43:16,015 --> 01:43:17,042
Believe me.

1110
01:43:20,912 --> 01:43:22,977
It's your turn.
- Come on.

1111
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,799
What's wrong.
- Darn it.

1112
01:43:26,047 --> 01:43:29,388
What you are doing
in the temple is wrong.

1113
01:43:29,468 --> 01:43:32,037
It's God's fault not ours.

1114
01:43:32,117 --> 01:43:35,518
He didn't give us job,
doesn't matter where He is.

1115
01:43:35,598 --> 01:43:38,079
You have to find a job yourself.

1116
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:40,576
God failed to give us a job.

1117
01:43:40,656 --> 01:43:42,847
That's true.
We don't need a barren land and God.

1118
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:43,657
Do you want them?

1119
01:43:43,737 --> 01:43:45,538
No.

1120
01:43:46,144 --> 01:43:48,479
All of you will be punished.

1121
01:43:49,051 --> 01:43:50,835
Punished? Who is going to do that?

1122
01:43:54,121 --> 01:43:55,116
Aghori!

1123
01:43:56,619 --> 01:43:58,662
We need one more person,
come and join us for a game.

1124
01:44:05,916 --> 01:44:08,500
I don't know this game.
- Then, what do you know?

1125
01:44:09,170 --> 01:44:11,138
I know tiger hunt.
- What did you say?

1126
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:13,322
The tiger and the goat game.

1127
01:44:13,635 --> 01:44:15,830
In this game, who is the tiger
and who is the goat?

1128
01:44:17,268 --> 01:44:21,614
The ones in a group are the goats.
The one who is alone is the tiger.

1129
01:44:22,229 --> 01:44:25,029
Looks like the tiger is here.
Looks like it's going to pounce on us.

1130
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:34,868
Fine, we are goats and you are a tiger.
Now, show us your game.

1131
01:44:35,559 --> 01:44:37,516
May your heart's desire come to fruition.

1132
01:44:51,701 --> 01:44:54,361
I don't know this game.

1133
01:44:56,653 --> 01:44:58,631
Who is that?
- What happened?

1134
01:44:58,711 --> 01:45:00,047
He is beating us.

1135
01:45:00,127 --> 01:45:02,047
Who are you?

1136
01:45:02,469 --> 01:45:03,658
Gora!

1137
01:45:06,253 --> 01:45:08,339
I am Akhanda Rudra Sikander Gora.

1138
01:45:08,631 --> 01:45:10,145
Destination is Kailash mountains.

1139
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:11,637
I enjoy skulls.

1140
01:45:11,864 --> 01:45:13,205
My weapon is Trishul.

1141
01:45:13,285 --> 01:45:14,945
My duty is to destroy evil.

1142
01:45:15,172 --> 01:45:16,069
I am a soldier.

1143
01:45:16,318 --> 01:45:17,702
I am Lord Shiva's soldier.

1144
01:45:17,782 --> 01:45:19,593
So? Why would you hit us?

1145
01:45:19,673 --> 01:45:21,405
I didn't hit them
because they were gambling,

1146
01:45:21,852 --> 01:45:23,441
I hit them
because they removed the God's idol.

1147
01:45:23,521 --> 01:45:25,160
You should've knocked sense into them.
Why did you beat them?

1148
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:26,696
Are they kids that
they need to be educated

1149
01:45:26,816 --> 01:45:27,982
with offerings of chocolates?

1150
01:45:28,631 --> 01:45:30,955
If you mess with divinity,
I will break your jaw.

1151
01:45:31,035 --> 01:45:32,934
You keep threatening us
with the trident.

1152
01:45:33,014 --> 01:45:33,755
Are you going to kill us?

1153
01:45:33,835 --> 01:45:36,631
Why would I need to use the trident
to kill an idiot like you

1154
01:45:37,258 --> 01:45:38,112
An idiot?

1155
01:45:38,361 --> 01:45:40,393
This is our village, our temple,
it's our wish.

1156
01:45:40,473 --> 01:45:42,068
We will do what we please with it.

1157
01:45:42,148 --> 01:45:44,252
Did you build this temple?
- No.

1158
01:45:44,332 --> 01:45:46,425
Then, how can you destroy the temple?

1159
01:45:50,187 --> 01:45:52,976
Do you know how much effort goes
into the establishment of a temple?

1160
01:45:53,366 --> 01:45:55,960
Do you know how much
energy comes out of it?

1161
01:45:56,608 --> 01:45:59,646
Be it be chanting, prayers,
the divine texts,

1162
01:45:59,992 --> 01:46:03,474
the Vedas, Dharmas, the treatises
on beginnings and decorations,

1163
01:46:03,554 --> 01:46:05,680
the rules that dictate the worship...

1164
01:46:05,971 --> 01:46:07,507
All these are joined together

1165
01:46:07,587 --> 01:46:09,112
and the structure is built.

1166
01:46:09,192 --> 01:46:10,939
That is when it becomes a temple.

1167
01:46:11,966 --> 01:46:15,004
Do you know the value and the glory of
the idol that sits at the temple's core?

1168
01:46:15,372 --> 01:46:17,914
To erase the pain of the people
and make them happy,

1169
01:46:17,994 --> 01:46:20,291
it is the God Vishnu Himself.

1170
01:46:20,751 --> 01:46:22,988
Goddess Sita preaches
the tenets of Dharma.

1171
01:46:23,281 --> 01:46:25,475
Lord Krishna comes
to preach life truths.

1172
01:46:25,702 --> 01:46:28,351
Lord Shiva comes to preach
the tenets of the soul.

1173
01:46:28,546 --> 01:46:29,800
Lord Anjeneya comes to give courage.

1174
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:31,216
Lord Ganesha for auspicious beginnings.

1175
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,363
Goddess Lakshmi
for wealth and prosperity.

1176
01:46:32,443 --> 01:46:33,563
Goddess Saraswati for knowledge.

1177
01:46:33,643 --> 01:46:37,563
The mother Goddess comes forth to give
the power of all the Gods in the universe.

1178
01:46:39,639 --> 01:46:42,871
The idol of Gods have been installed
in the temple for your protection.

1179
01:46:43,077 --> 01:46:45,423
How dare you disrespect them?

1180
01:46:46,212 --> 01:46:48,731
Stop it. You are right.

1181
01:46:49,228 --> 01:46:50,860
But, the science has developed so much.

1182
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:52,838
Why are you giving a lot of
importance to an invisible God?

1183
01:46:52,918 --> 01:46:55,660
When you fall ill, where would you go?

1184
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:56,601
To the hospital.

1185
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:59,163
Why is there a temple in the hospital?

1186
01:47:00,612 --> 01:47:03,574
The doctors pray to the God
by asking for His guidance

1187
01:47:03,654 --> 01:47:05,260
while operating
to save a person's life.

1188
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:06,049
Why is it?

1189
01:47:06,309 --> 01:47:08,936
So that they are successful in treating
the patient by the grace of God.

1190
01:47:10,828 --> 01:47:13,509
And the scientists who you hail,

1191
01:47:13,865 --> 01:47:15,713
the very ones who launch rockets
from Sri Hari Kota,

1192
01:47:15,793 --> 01:47:17,973
ask for His benevolence and guidance.

1193
01:47:18,053 --> 01:47:19,022
Why is it?

1194
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:22,157
It is because God would help them
fulfill their mission.

1195
01:47:24,092 --> 01:47:27,400
God is the father of all creations.
Nature is the mother.

1196
01:47:27,952 --> 01:47:29,812
And science is their child.

1197
01:47:30,439 --> 01:47:33,098
This is truth. Learn it.

1198
01:47:36,147 --> 01:47:40,049
Ask for God's mercy,
don't challenge Him.

1199
01:48:02,736 --> 01:48:04,368
Please, ma'am. Please.

1200
01:48:08,283 --> 01:48:09,504
Sir, please.

1201
01:48:10,066 --> 01:48:11,202
No, it's not possible.

1202
01:48:13,606 --> 01:48:16,849
Please come, ma'am.

1203
01:48:17,758 --> 01:48:18,990
Please, ma'am.

1204
01:48:19,070 --> 01:48:19,833
Sir...

1205
01:48:19,913 --> 01:48:20,936
We know.

1206
01:48:21,016 --> 01:48:21,876
Wait.

1207
01:48:22,211 --> 01:48:23,292
Get in.

1208
01:48:31,519 --> 01:48:33,417
If there is a blast in the hospital,

1209
01:48:33,659 --> 01:48:36,297
it should lead to the death
of all the people of all areas.

1210
01:48:36,377 --> 01:48:38,297
But people from only one area died.
- Yes.

1211
01:48:38,377 --> 01:48:40,395
I had asked you for the enquiry report.
Where is it?

1212
01:48:40,475 --> 01:48:41,411
It is ready..
- Good.

1213
01:48:41,491 --> 01:48:42,968
The people who were admitted
in his hospital

1214
01:48:43,048 --> 01:48:44,229
were affected by the radiations.

1215
01:48:44,309 --> 01:48:46,385
The reason for it is Varadha Mines.

1216
01:48:46,465 --> 01:48:47,628
But that is not correct, sir.

1217
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:51,358
I personally visited the site
and investigated it.

1218
01:48:51,438 --> 01:48:52,774
There are just copper mines there.

1219
01:48:52,854 --> 01:48:54,688
There is no possibility
of any presence of radiation.

1220
01:48:55,347 --> 01:48:56,699
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1221
01:49:04,602 --> 01:49:05,219
Hello?

1222
01:49:06,397 --> 01:49:07,067
Yes.

1223
01:49:10,397 --> 01:49:11,305
Is that so?

1224
01:49:18,030 --> 01:49:18,959
Remove the cameras.

1225
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:31,186
I am not clear on whether you
are a farmer or a criminal.

1226
01:49:31,531 --> 01:49:36,017
Just now, I was offered
100 crores to kill you.

1227
01:49:36,223 --> 01:49:39,694
That is a big amount.
It's double my weight.

1228
01:49:42,099 --> 01:49:46,505
Anyone else could have gotten
the exact same call.

1229
01:49:48,278 --> 01:49:50,959
They say that society is
protected by God and gun.

1230
01:49:51,305 --> 01:49:54,645
God might not be tempted
upon listening to this offer.

1231
01:49:55,077 --> 01:49:58,894
But anyone with a gun
would be tempted.

1232
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:02,499
I came here to close the case.

1233
01:50:03,061 --> 01:50:05,083
Don't take this so far that
it would end with you being killed.

1234
01:50:06,402 --> 01:50:07,526
What exactly happened?

1235
01:50:09,462 --> 01:50:11,246
Same bloody old silence!

1236
01:50:12,403 --> 01:50:14,403
They won't tell me why
you should be killed.

1237
01:50:14,748 --> 01:50:16,716
And you don't tell me
who killed them.

1238
01:50:17,322 --> 01:50:18,651
Who will tell the truth?

1239
01:50:20,230 --> 01:50:21,981
Who is going to tell the truth?

1240
01:50:25,819 --> 01:50:31,213
(Chants)

1241
01:50:33,419 --> 01:50:39,139
(Chants)

1242
01:50:41,073 --> 01:50:46,738
(Chants)

1243
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:54,283
(Chants)

1244
01:51:20,307 --> 01:51:22,501
Hail Lord Shiva!

1245
01:51:39,627 --> 01:51:42,632
Sir, the operations in Varadha Mines
is not regarding copper mining.

1246
01:51:42,827 --> 01:51:44,556
It is regarding dangerous
uranium extraction.

1247
01:51:44,636 --> 01:51:46,643
I have all the necessary
proofs regarding this.

1248
01:51:47,378 --> 01:51:49,608
Mr. Murali Krishna
might bring this truth to life

1249
01:51:49,728 --> 01:51:51,227
and that is why
they are trying to kill him.

1250
01:51:54,232 --> 01:51:56,314
Sir, I will be there
with the files in an hour.

1251
01:51:56,394 --> 01:51:58,134
I need to meet with
Mr. Krishnaacharya.

1252
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:07,772
They say wars took place
because of woman.

1253
01:52:08,594 --> 01:52:12,541
You opened your mouth
and many children died.

1254
01:52:12,908 --> 01:52:14,746
And he is in custody.

1255
01:52:15,784 --> 01:52:18,325
Thousands of people
are buried in the earth.

1256
01:52:20,044 --> 01:52:23,731
Someone disturbed me
by killing my brother.

1257
01:52:24,422 --> 01:52:29,352
I want to kill him
but you are intervening.

1258
01:52:36,747 --> 01:52:39,525
Hey...
- Mother!

1259
01:52:44,271 --> 01:52:45,103
No!

1260
01:52:46,367 --> 01:52:48,994
Get up. Stop me. Come.
- Don't beat him.

1261
01:52:49,589 --> 01:52:50,638
Let go of him.
- Mother!

1262
01:52:51,059 --> 01:52:52,854
Please don't beat him.
Let go of him.

1263
01:52:52,934 --> 01:52:54,273
I beg to you. Let go of him.

1264
01:52:54,393 --> 01:52:56,075
I am your enemy,

1265
01:52:56,508 --> 01:52:57,848
Let go of my son.

1266
01:52:57,928 --> 01:52:59,416
Please don't beat him.

1267
01:53:00,227 --> 01:53:02,389
Let go of him. I beg to you.

1268
01:53:13,318 --> 01:53:16,885
Bring her son here.

1269
01:53:18,983 --> 01:53:19,653
Look.

1270
01:53:19,913 --> 01:53:20,572
Look.
- Mother!

1271
01:53:24,865 --> 01:53:25,665
No!

1272
01:53:38,107 --> 01:53:40,917
You can't lock horns with me

1273
01:53:40,997 --> 01:53:45,144
because you have the support
of the government and the people.

1274
01:53:50,485 --> 01:53:53,544
Go and do what you want.
Take the kid away.

1275
01:53:53,624 --> 01:53:54,345
Come on.

1276
01:54:10,064 --> 01:54:12,194
Hail the supreme God.

1277
01:54:41,556 --> 01:54:45,881
You know where he was born
and what brought him here.

1278
01:54:47,048 --> 01:54:50,626
You also want to know
how he is going die.

1279
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:52,853
That is why I brought you here.

1280
01:54:55,502 --> 01:54:59,999
If a deer is attacked by 25 cheetahs,

1281
01:55:02,939 --> 01:55:05,133
they would pounce on it, all at once.

1282
01:55:17,858 --> 01:55:21,533
When they keep tearing the bone
and flesh off the body of the deer,

1283
01:55:21,825 --> 01:55:23,015
what will happen
to the life of that deer?

1284
01:55:23,095 --> 01:55:25,847
What will happen if there is
a lion in place of that deer?

1285
01:55:27,155 --> 01:55:29,313
Up until then, that vengeful lion
kept a lid on the emotions of anger

1286
01:55:29,393 --> 01:55:31,317
pain, revenge, lust, arrogance.

1287
01:55:31,397 --> 01:55:37,264
Once it opens its eyes and
throws its fiery gaze around.

1288
01:55:37,654 --> 01:55:40,864
(Chants)

1289
01:55:40,944 --> 01:55:43,708
(Chants)

1290
01:55:46,411 --> 01:55:50,573
(Chants)

1291
01:55:54,767 --> 01:55:58,129
(Chants)

1292
01:56:00,107 --> 01:56:01,706
Imagine if Lord Shiva
turned himself into a bow,

1293
01:56:01,826 --> 01:56:03,286
with Lord Vishnu as the string and

1294
01:56:03,502 --> 01:56:07,167
wore Sri Hari as his armor
and begins the war.

1295
01:56:07,247 --> 01:56:08,658
How would that look?

1296
01:56:12,864 --> 01:56:15,610
I am Varadha Raj.

1297
01:56:15,690 --> 01:56:17,653
You fool. He is Lord Shiva.

1298
01:56:17,733 --> 01:56:18,647
He is going to die.

1299
01:56:18,727 --> 01:56:19,934
He will come.

1300
01:56:20,054 --> 01:56:21,717
Call him.
- He is here.

1301
01:56:28,679 --> 01:56:31,263
(Chants)

1302
01:56:32,625 --> 01:56:36,192
(Chants)

1303
01:56:38,906 --> 01:56:40,128
Akhanda.

1304
01:56:54,365 --> 01:56:56,279
Mother!

1305
01:57:10,787 --> 01:57:11,760
Don't cry, mother.

1306
01:57:12,063 --> 01:57:14,387
Get up. Don't cry.

1307
01:57:14,701 --> 01:57:17,025
Mother, look at me.

1308
01:57:25,447 --> 01:57:27,296
He showed you my death.

1309
01:57:27,923 --> 01:57:29,955
God is going to show you his death.

1310
01:57:30,035 --> 01:57:30,950
Look there!

1311
01:58:06,733 --> 01:58:09,577
(Chants)

1312
01:58:09,657 --> 01:58:12,431
(Chants)

1313
01:58:12,777 --> 01:58:16,788
(Chants)

1314
01:58:18,291 --> 01:58:21,145
(Chants)

1315
01:58:21,318 --> 01:58:23,991
(Chants)

1316
01:58:24,111 --> 01:58:28,312
(Chants)

1317
01:58:38,798 --> 01:58:41,836
(Chants)

1318
01:58:54,129 --> 01:58:57,545
(Chants)

1319
01:58:59,838 --> 01:59:03,406
(Chants)

1320
02:00:20,929 --> 02:00:24,324
(Chants)

1321
02:00:26,626 --> 02:00:30,345
(Chants)

1322
02:01:19,663 --> 02:01:22,593
(Chants)

1323
02:01:22,777 --> 02:01:25,512
(Chants)

1324
02:01:25,592 --> 02:01:28,237
(Chants)

1325
02:01:51,589 --> 02:01:52,778
I have a Mine.

1326
02:01:52,858 --> 02:01:54,184
I am arrogant.

1327
02:01:54,264 --> 02:01:55,730
People have faith in me.

1328
02:01:55,810 --> 02:01:58,865
I have a teacher,
I can do anything I want.

1329
02:01:58,945 --> 02:02:01,135
If you mess with mother earth
and woman,

1330
02:02:02,162 --> 02:02:04,324
your root chakra will be destroyed.

1331
02:02:10,129 --> 02:02:13,106
Your sacral chakra will be destroyed.

1332
02:02:13,426 --> 02:02:16,205
(Chants)

1333
02:02:16,285 --> 02:02:19,037
(Chants)

1334
02:02:19,274 --> 02:02:21,134
Your solar plexus chakra
will be destroyed.

1335
02:02:25,490 --> 02:02:28,852
(Chants)

1336
02:02:32,615 --> 02:02:34,518
Your Heart chakra
will be destroyed.

1337
02:02:42,301 --> 02:02:44,377
Your throat chakra will be destroyed.

1338
02:02:44,614 --> 02:02:50,041
(Chants)

1339
02:02:50,225 --> 02:02:52,344
(Chants)

1340
02:02:52,424 --> 02:02:54,117
Your third eye chakra
will be destroyed.

1341
02:02:54,582 --> 02:02:56,971
(Chants)

1342
02:02:57,826 --> 02:03:01,718
Your crown chakra will be destroyed.
Hail Lord Shiva!

1343
02:03:07,656 --> 02:03:09,169
Offering it all to Lord Shiva.

1344
02:03:09,548 --> 02:03:13,862
(Chants)

1345
02:03:13,942 --> 02:03:17,991
(Chants)

1346
02:03:18,228 --> 02:03:21,072
(Chants)

1347
02:03:21,152 --> 02:03:24,542
(Chants)

1348
02:03:43,115 --> 02:03:47,093
A lot of you people have died.
Do you want to lose more?

1349
02:03:50,087 --> 02:03:51,784
Gun down. Gun down.

1350
02:03:54,595 --> 02:03:55,979
What is the meaning
of this veneration of death?

1351
02:03:56,465 --> 02:03:58,692
This isn't about killing people.

1352
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:00,519
I cleaned up pollution.

1353
02:04:01,178 --> 02:04:03,610
Polluting has become
a passion for every loon.

1354
02:04:03,690 --> 02:04:05,232
That is why I had to clean it.

1355
02:04:05,556 --> 02:04:06,626
Dust cleaning.

1356
02:04:06,706 --> 02:04:08,378
In another word pest cleaning.

1357
02:04:12,106 --> 02:04:13,772
Killing of the germs.

1358
02:04:15,804 --> 02:04:16,626
Why are you walking away?

1359
02:04:16,706 --> 02:04:17,696
He was indeed a criminal.

1360
02:04:17,776 --> 02:04:18,950
You must hand him over to us.

1361
02:04:19,030 --> 02:04:20,215
How could you kill him?

1362
02:04:22,788 --> 02:04:24,370
What are you going to do
if I hand him over?

1363
02:04:24,490 --> 02:04:25,523
I would've put him in prison.

1364
02:04:25,913 --> 02:04:28,474
You would just put him in prison.
I put him into hell.

1365
02:04:31,155 --> 02:04:34,690
The one who pollutes the earth and
troubles women has no right to live.

1366
02:04:34,863 --> 02:04:36,041
We will not spare him.

1367
02:04:36,247 --> 02:04:37,220
We will kill him.

1368
02:04:37,641 --> 02:04:39,122
We will chase him and kill him.

1369
02:04:43,533 --> 02:04:46,106
If a child misbehaves,
the mother beats it.

1370
02:04:46,377 --> 02:04:47,879
Do you think mother earth
would stay quiet?

1371
02:04:47,959 --> 02:04:50,215
She asked me to kill him
and that is what I did.

1372
02:04:50,842 --> 02:04:52,446
Order, sir.
In one shot, I'll finish him.

1373
02:04:52,566 --> 02:04:53,339
Hey, no. Wait.

1374
02:04:58,605 --> 02:05:00,313
What are you doing?
- Tamed dog.

1375
02:05:01,037 --> 02:05:02,421
You are dog
that's been domesticated.

1376
02:05:03,881 --> 02:05:06,357
You can only bark,
you must not growl.

1377
02:05:07,113 --> 02:05:10,205
You have a young daughter and
she needs to complete her education.

1378
02:05:10,671 --> 02:05:13,789
That is why I'm sparing your life.
Go away.

1379
02:05:16,238 --> 02:05:20,065
As an ascetic,
the Hindu religion says

1380
02:05:20,433 --> 02:05:22,119
that non-violence
is the highest moral virtue.

1381
02:05:22,199 --> 02:05:23,265
Correct yourself.

1382
02:05:24,551 --> 02:05:27,957
That is just half the sacred
verse used to control aggression.

1383
02:05:28,681 --> 02:05:31,470
Do you know
what Haindava Dharma says?

1384
02:05:32,962 --> 02:05:36,951
SANSKRIT

1385
02:05:37,264 --> 02:05:39,091
Do you know what it means?

1386
02:05:39,491 --> 02:05:41,588
Non-violence is the highest
moral duty of mankind.

1387
02:05:42,053 --> 02:05:45,545
So too is violence in the
service of the highest Dharma.

1388
02:05:45,901 --> 02:05:47,188
That is exactly what happened.

1389
02:05:47,815 --> 02:05:49,322
From now on,
if a man crosses his limits,

1390
02:05:49,442 --> 02:05:50,831
this is exactly what's
going to happen to him.

1391
02:05:55,025 --> 02:05:57,144
Sir, no matter what you say,

1392
02:05:57,382 --> 02:05:59,717
according to law, anyone who takes away
another person's life is a criminal.

1393
02:05:59,797 --> 02:06:01,198
that doesn't apply to me.

1394
02:06:02,237 --> 02:06:05,891
Doesn't apply to you?
Are you not a human being like us?

1395
02:06:06,161 --> 02:06:07,058
Never!

1396
02:06:07,371 --> 02:06:09,609
Your world and
my world are not the same, officer.

1397
02:06:10,863 --> 02:06:12,150
You've studied the justice system.

1398
02:06:12,604 --> 02:06:14,074
I believe in Dharma.

1399
02:06:14,528 --> 02:06:15,955
Both are not same.

1400
02:06:17,285 --> 02:06:21,685
You keep searching for God.
I live together with God.

1401
02:06:22,085 --> 02:06:23,566
Both are not same.

1402
02:06:24,268 --> 02:06:27,620
Your family is your world.
For me, the entire world is my family.

1403
02:06:28,246 --> 02:06:29,446
Both are not same.

1404
02:06:31,425 --> 02:06:35,468
You search for life.
I search for death.

1405
02:06:36,322 --> 02:06:38,139
Both are not same.

1406
02:06:40,733 --> 02:06:43,955
You people cannot hold a piece of ice
on the palm even for 30 seconds.

1407
02:06:44,182 --> 02:06:46,993
We are people who brave the cold and
live in those eternally cold mountains.

1408
02:06:47,587 --> 02:06:49,014
Both are not same.

1409
02:06:50,236 --> 02:06:52,269
If you face a problem,
you beg for God's graces.

1410
02:06:52,593 --> 02:06:54,496
We put an end to that problem itself.

1411
02:06:55,815 --> 02:06:56,993
Just like this.

1412
02:06:58,962 --> 02:07:00,605
Both are not same.

1413
02:07:03,729 --> 02:07:06,346
You chant mantras for the life of man.

1414
02:07:06,789 --> 02:07:10,248
And if that very life is in danger,
we fight wars.

1415
02:07:12,129 --> 02:07:14,215
A very horrible war.

1416
02:08:09,178 --> 02:08:14,432
"Hail Lord Shiva! Show Your powers.
Erase everyone's problems."

1417
02:08:14,713 --> 02:08:17,232
"Lord Shiva, kill the evil."

1418
02:08:17,312 --> 02:08:20,010
"You win the battle
and do Your duty."

1419
02:08:20,090 --> 02:08:25,492
"You are Lord Shiva,
You have mercy on us."

1420
02:08:25,572 --> 02:08:30,951
"O Lord, the religion is in trouble."

1421
02:08:31,031 --> 02:08:38,518
"O hairy one, You ease the problem
and follow the tradition."

1422
02:08:38,598 --> 02:08:43,923
"You are immortal."

1423
02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:49,306
"You save Your devotee
and punish the sinner."

1424
02:08:49,386 --> 02:08:54,917
"You are immortal."

1425
02:08:55,165 --> 02:09:01,327
"You erase the evil from Earth."

1426
02:09:22,807 --> 02:09:25,423
"You kill the demons."

1427
02:09:25,503 --> 02:09:28,515
"There's army of demons,
kill them with Your trident."

1428
02:09:28,595 --> 02:09:30,958
"Be victorious."

1429
02:09:31,038 --> 02:09:33,996
"Don't spare anyone.
Kill them with your trident."

1430
02:09:43,974 --> 02:09:49,390
"You are immortal."

1431
02:09:49,683 --> 02:09:54,710
"You save Your devotee
and punish the sinner."

1432
02:09:54,790 --> 02:10:00,536
"You are immortal."

1433
02:10:00,616 --> 02:10:06,774
"You erase the evil from Earth."

1434
02:10:16,125 --> 02:10:16,817
Baba.

1435
02:10:18,504 --> 02:10:19,368
The child.

1436
02:10:25,509 --> 02:10:28,352
(Chants)

1437
02:10:32,266 --> 02:10:36,790
Call for the expert of mantra and
tantra, Kedari Agori Baba, from Kashi.

1438
02:10:37,958 --> 02:10:39,904
Some evil spell has been cast on her.

1439
02:10:44,047 --> 02:10:45,333
Baba!

1440
02:10:55,152 --> 02:10:59,887
While I was searching for his strength,
I found out about his weakness.

1441
02:11:03,736 --> 02:11:06,276
I made a move that's going
to result in his death.

1442
02:11:10,114 --> 02:11:13,163
Until now, weren't we
at the receiving end?

1443
02:11:13,412 --> 02:11:16,320
Now, when we hit back, he must die.

1444
02:11:18,579 --> 02:11:19,747
Deploy.

1445
02:11:20,591 --> 02:11:23,185
No matter in which corner your
strengths lie, deploy them.

1446
02:11:25,835 --> 02:11:30,018
This is the final opportunity.
Deploy your strengths.

1447
02:11:47,674 --> 02:11:49,457
You've invested yourself
in this relationship.

1448
02:11:50,020 --> 02:11:52,063
They've invested in your weakness.

1449
02:11:53,187 --> 02:11:56,301
Don't you know that our journey
is antithetical to relationships?

1450
02:11:56,538 --> 02:11:57,998
My destination is Lord Shiva.

1451
02:12:00,549 --> 02:12:03,056
What if the mission that
you wanted to give life to,

1452
02:12:03,176 --> 02:12:05,306
asks for your life in return
as a sacrifice?

1453
02:12:05,386 --> 02:12:06,301
Let's do it.

1454
02:12:17,057 --> 02:12:18,970
Get everything ready
for the fire sacrifice ritual.

1455
02:12:22,970 --> 02:12:24,181
Akhanda.

1456
02:12:25,986 --> 02:12:27,276
The most powerful force

1457
02:12:27,396 --> 02:12:29,391
that can change the impossible
into possible in this world,

1458
02:12:29,673 --> 02:12:33,337
that can command the coming
together of nine planets

1459
02:12:33,521 --> 02:12:37,489
and command the constellation of stars

1460
02:12:38,462 --> 02:12:40,581
lies in this fire ritual.

1461
02:12:43,091 --> 02:12:47,329
I have made this weapon to
save lives.

1462
02:12:49,004 --> 02:12:51,469
This is a very powerful veneration.

1463
02:12:56,681 --> 02:13:01,449
It can change the destiny
written by Lord Brahma.

1464
02:13:02,011 --> 02:13:06,055
This is the only way to save lives
from the Lord.

1465
02:13:07,136 --> 02:13:10,357
But the end result
is that Supreme Lord's.

1466
02:13:10,530 --> 02:13:13,384
(Chants)

1467
02:13:13,622 --> 02:13:14,519
Akhanda.

1468
02:13:16,173 --> 02:13:20,682
you need to chant the mantra
until the ritual is over.

1469
02:13:21,514 --> 02:13:23,385
You are the protector of this ritual.

1470
02:13:23,860 --> 02:13:28,855
Yours is the will,
the accomplishment is Lord Shiva's.

1471
02:13:28,935 --> 02:13:30,077
Begin!

1472
02:13:34,022 --> 02:13:36,919
(Chants)

1473
02:13:40,033 --> 02:13:44,509
(Chants)

1474
02:13:44,703 --> 02:13:49,049
(Chants)

1475
02:13:56,951 --> 02:14:00,378
(Chants)

1476
02:14:01,697 --> 02:14:04,826
(Chants)

1477
02:14:47,917 --> 02:14:48,685
Gaja,

1478
02:14:49,798 --> 02:14:53,160
he is right now locked as a prisoner
to the Shiva Panchakshari mantra.

1479
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:55,037
Until that child's life returns,

1480
02:14:55,117 --> 02:15:01,701
he can't stop chanting
nor can he turn his head.

1481
02:15:02,468 --> 02:15:05,819
Even if Lord Shiva calls him,
he will not get up.

1482
02:15:31,260 --> 02:15:34,254
Why are you hitting him here and there?
Hit him on the head.

1483
02:16:26,976 --> 02:16:28,013
Brugu...

1484
02:17:33,149 --> 02:17:36,371
Gaja, he is at the last stage
of chanting of the mantra.

1485
02:17:36,598 --> 02:17:39,625
You must distract his focus from God.

1486
02:17:39,705 --> 02:17:40,490
Go!

1487
02:18:03,688 --> 02:18:04,823
Akhanda.

1488
02:18:06,034 --> 02:18:07,580
The ritual is over.

1489
02:18:09,278 --> 02:18:10,975
The child is awake.

1490
02:18:19,775 --> 02:18:23,375
(Chants)

1491
02:18:25,418 --> 02:18:28,964
(Chants)

1492
02:18:38,305 --> 02:18:40,813
(Chants)

1493
02:18:41,202 --> 02:18:43,635
(Chants)

1494
02:18:43,862 --> 02:18:46,554
(Chants)

1495
02:18:46,813 --> 02:18:49,894
(Chants)

1496
02:18:51,678 --> 02:18:56,911
(Chants)

1497
02:18:57,614 --> 02:19:02,770
(Chants)

1498
02:19:06,403 --> 02:19:09,214
(Chants)

1499
02:19:09,294 --> 02:19:11,927
(Chants)

1500
02:19:12,155 --> 02:19:15,290
(Chants)

1501
02:19:29,603 --> 02:19:31,419
(Chants)

1502
02:19:45,591 --> 02:19:50,802
(Chants)

1503
02:19:51,343 --> 02:19:56,694
(Chants)

1504
02:20:02,535 --> 02:20:04,989
(Chants)

1505
02:20:08,350 --> 02:20:10,653
(Chants)

1506
02:20:10,977 --> 02:20:13,766
(Chants)

1507
02:20:13,846 --> 02:20:16,545
(Chants)

1508
02:20:16,718 --> 02:20:19,562
(Chants)

1509
02:20:19,642 --> 02:20:23,324
(Chants)

1510
02:21:00,686 --> 02:21:04,058
(Chants)

1511
02:21:16,394 --> 02:21:21,907
(Chants)

1512
02:21:23,928 --> 02:21:27,507
(Chants)

1513
02:21:27,723 --> 02:21:29,182
Everything is over.

1514
02:21:29,528 --> 02:21:31,269
He is not human now.

1515
02:21:31,485 --> 02:21:32,512
It's Lord Shiva.

1516
02:21:33,605 --> 02:21:36,070
We need to stop him.
Surround him.

1517
02:22:33,712 --> 02:22:36,209
(Chants)

1518
02:22:36,289 --> 02:22:39,160
(Chants)

1519
02:22:39,355 --> 02:22:42,511
(Chants)

1520
02:22:44,816 --> 02:22:47,702
(Chants)

1521
02:22:47,951 --> 02:22:50,210
(Chants)

1522
02:22:50,632 --> 02:22:54,729
(Chants)

1523
02:23:05,086 --> 02:23:08,102
(Chants)

1524
02:23:08,297 --> 02:23:11,075
(Chants)

1525
02:23:15,919 --> 02:23:17,075
He carries river Ganga on his head,

1526
02:23:17,155 --> 02:23:18,319
fire on his forehead,

1527
02:23:18,399 --> 02:23:19,519
poison in his throat.

1528
02:23:19,599 --> 02:23:21,844
The nature carries
the entire world in its womb

1529
02:23:21,964 --> 02:23:23,876
and you mess with it?

1530
02:23:24,460 --> 02:23:26,557
Will you kill the child
who is the form of God?

1531
02:23:26,731 --> 02:23:32,018
You dare touch the third eye?!

1532
02:24:09,154 --> 02:24:13,100
(Chants)

1533
02:24:14,386 --> 02:24:19,813
(Chants)

1534
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:25,391
(Chants)

1535
02:24:26,137 --> 02:24:30,948
(Chants)

1536
02:24:31,282 --> 02:24:32,450
Father.

1537
02:24:39,131 --> 02:24:40,374
Father.

1538
02:24:54,249 --> 02:24:58,801
Son, let bygones be bygones.
Please stay with us now.

1539
02:25:03,363 --> 02:25:06,790
(Chants)

1540
02:25:06,870 --> 02:25:10,530
(Chants)

1541
02:25:10,610 --> 02:25:16,077
(Chants)

1542
02:25:17,450 --> 02:25:19,839
Sir, please. Please listen to me.

1543
02:25:19,919 --> 02:25:25,687
(Chants)

1544
02:25:25,914 --> 02:25:29,212
(Chants)

1545
02:25:29,292 --> 02:25:30,456
Baba.

1546
02:25:33,926 --> 02:25:35,483
Baba.

1547
02:25:40,056 --> 02:25:41,483
Baba.

1548
02:25:55,331 --> 02:25:58,488
Baba, where are you going?
When will you come back?

1549
02:26:02,737 --> 02:26:09,115
Everyone is sad that you are leaving.

1550
02:26:09,235 --> 02:26:10,997
Aren't you sad?

1551
02:26:11,077 --> 02:26:13,062
I don't desire anything.

1552
02:26:15,429 --> 02:26:18,067
What about me then?

1553
02:26:18,446 --> 02:26:22,467
The very moment I was born,
Lord Shiva cut off all my ties

1554
02:26:23,267 --> 02:26:26,435
to relationships and affection,
friendship and enmity.

1555
02:26:26,515 --> 02:26:29,353
Did he break your relationship
with me as well?

1556
02:26:37,559 --> 02:26:39,516
Mother said that

1557
02:26:39,991 --> 02:26:42,272
your soul lies in me.

1558
02:26:42,532 --> 02:26:46,337
If you leave,
it will leave with you too.

1559
02:26:54,403 --> 02:26:55,971
You shouldn't say that.

1560
02:26:56,219 --> 02:26:58,598
Don't leave me and go.

1561
02:26:58,678 --> 02:27:00,749
Don't leave me and go.

1562
02:27:01,419 --> 02:27:04,003
Don't go.

1563
02:27:10,544 --> 02:27:12,836
I want you.

1564
02:27:14,091 --> 02:27:16,469
Don't go.

1565
02:27:21,194 --> 02:27:23,734
I want you.

1566
02:27:27,626 --> 02:27:31,561
If you go away, what will I do?

1567
02:27:31,641 --> 02:27:33,021
Don't go.

1568
02:27:33,215 --> 02:27:34,567
I am giving you my promise.

1569
02:27:34,989 --> 02:27:36,610
If you are in difficulties
or destruction,

1570
02:27:37,010 --> 02:27:40,718
in fear or in pain,
or if you face death,

1571
02:27:40,957 --> 02:27:42,955
no matter where I am or
in what condition I am,

1572
02:27:43,075 --> 02:27:44,438
I will be there before you.

1573
02:27:45,551 --> 02:27:47,378
This is my promise.

1574
02:27:48,956 --> 02:27:52,405
(Chants)

1575
02:27:52,610 --> 02:27:54,588
(Chants)

1576
02:27:55,507 --> 02:27:57,475
Baba.

1577
02:27:57,788 --> 02:28:01,821
(Chants)

1578
02:28:02,059 --> 02:28:04,361
(Chants)

1579
02:28:04,441 --> 02:28:09,063

1580
02:28:25,182 --> 02:28:27,420

1581
02:28:36,404 --> 02:28:39,928
(Chants)

1582
02:28:43,636 --> 02:28:47,377
(Chants)

1583
02:28:47,457 --> 02:28:51,182
(Chants)

1584
02:28:51,262 --> 02:28:54,037
(Chants)

1585
02:28:54,804 --> 02:29:01,399
(Chants)

1586
02:29:01,702 --> 02:29:05,443
(Chants)

1587
02:29:05,523 --> 02:29:09,086
(Chants)

1588
02:29:09,166 --> 02:29:12,340
(Chants)
