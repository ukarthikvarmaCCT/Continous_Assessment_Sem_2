1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,075
24th November, 1971.

3
00:00:03,075 --> 00:00:06,038
In America, a Northwest Orient Airlines flight

4
00:00:06,038 --> 00:00:08,087
took off from Portland.

5
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:10,813
This is a small, 30-minute flight

6
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:12,427
to Seattle city nearby.

7
00:00:12,427 --> 00:00:14,175
Not many passengers were on this flight.

8
00:00:14,175 --> 00:00:16,547
It was carrying only 36 passengers 
and 6 crew members.

9
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:19,343
But these passengers were unaware that

10
00:00:19,343 --> 00:00:23,225
a hijacker was present on this flight.

11
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:26,163
A man named D.B. Cooper.

12
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:29,732
The hijacker looked like a normal businessman.

13
00:00:29,732 --> 00:00:31,731
He was dressed like that.

14
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,869
A business suit, white shirt, and black pants.

15
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:36,602
He must have been in his mid-forties.

16
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:39,848
He intentionally sat in the last row of the plane.

17
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:42,020
Seat number 18E.

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,928
As soon as the plane took off,

19
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:47,156
this guy introduced himself to an air hostess.

20
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:49,675
He mentions his name, Dan Cooper.

21
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,194
The hostess's name was Florence Schaffner.

22
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:56,881
And with a big smile, he handed a note to the air hostess.

23
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:58,964
Schaffner was a 23-year-old woman

24
00:00:58,964 --> 00:01:01,641
who thought that this man was trying to flirt with her.

25
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:03,490
So, she took that note

26
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,143
and kept it with her without reading it.

27
00:01:05,143 --> 00:01:07,339
Seeing this, Cooper told her,

28
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:09,897
that she should read the note.

29
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,141
He said, that he had a b0mb.

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,538
When Schaffner opened the note,

31
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:20,205
it was clearly written in neat handwriting,

32
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,907
"Miss, I have a b0mb in my briefcase

33
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:25,046
and I want you to sit by me."

34
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:27,661
Schaffner quietly sat next to Cooper,

35
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:29,094
but she still couldn't believe that

36
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:30,975
he actually had a bomb.

37
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:34,333
So Cooper opened his suitcase to show it to her.

38
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,152
Some red cylinders, wires,

39
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:39,425
and a big cylindrical battery were in the suitcase.

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,310
There was no doubt that it was a b0mb.

41
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,975
Cooper made his demands to the air hostess.

42
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:49,320
He wanted $200,000 by 5 pm that evening.

43
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,446
That too in cash.

44
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:53,028
He wanted all that cash in a bag

45
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:57,242
along with 2 parachutes in the back 
and 2 parachutes in the front.

46
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,807
When they eventually landed,

47
00:01:58,807 --> 00:02:02,118
he wanted to have a fuel truck ready to refuel the plane.

48
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:04,117
He warned her against trying anything strange

49
00:02:04,117 --> 00:02:06,596
threatening to blow up the plane otherwise.

50
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:10,033
The other passengers on the plane were unaware of this

51
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:12,030
and Air Hostess Schaffner didn't want

52
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,609
the other passengers to know.

53
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:15,922
She quietly went into the cockpit

54
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:18,065
and showed Cooper's note to the pilots.

55
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:21,567
Another Air Hostess, Tina Mucklow was informed about this

56
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,891
and she sat beside Cooper.

57
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:25,879
With the help of these two air hostesses,

58
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,293
the contact between the plane's cockpit 
and Cooper could be maintained.

59
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:32,153
The pilots informed the air traffic controller

60
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:35,021
and soon the news reached the president of the airline,

61
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,678
Donald Nairob.

62
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:38,605
He was the decision-maker

63
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:40,765
and he made an interesting decision.

64
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:43,619
He told the staff to ensure full compliance with Cooper's demands.

65
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:47,058
To fulfil all demands made by this hijacker.

66
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:48,927
After coordinating with the FBI,

67
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:52,259
he talked to a Seattle bank to arrange the money.

68
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,114
The bank had a huge bundle of 
money for such emergencies.

69
00:02:56,114 --> 00:02:58,485
But there was something special about this bundle of money.

70
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:00,387
We will talk about it later in the video.

71
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:02,987
But you must be wondering

72
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:04,911
why did the airline's president

73
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:07,814
decide to cooperate with the hijackers?

74
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:09,787
The reason behind this was Reputation.

75
00:03:09,787 --> 00:03:11,819
The airline's president didn't want

76
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,917
the news of the hijack to spread all over the world

77
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:16,379
leading to heavy losses for his company.

78
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,294
So to keep this issue under wraps,

79
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:21,175
he was willing to fulfil the demands of the hijackers.

80
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:22,826
The only problem was that

81
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:24,848
they needed some time to arrange the money

82
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:27,034
but this flight was only supposed to be half an hour long.

83
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:28,926
So the pilots were told that

84
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:30,792
instead of landing the plane,

85
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:33,963
they were to keep circling around Seattle

86
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,543
until they could arrange the money on the ground.

87
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:40,216
This half-hour flight gradually became 3 hours long.

88
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:43,495
Passengers were still unaware of what was happening.

89
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:46,082
Flight pilots announced that

90
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:48,402
they were facing minor technical difficulties,

91
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:49,759
causing the delay.

92
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,839
The other passengers believed this.

93
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:56,299
Finally, this flight landed at 
Seattle's airport at 5.46 pm.

94
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:57,928
According to Cooper's instructions,

95
00:03:57,928 --> 00:04:00,865
the plane was parked far from the main terminal building. 

96
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:04,502
One airline representative approached the plane

97
00:04:04,502 --> 00:04:06,678
with a bag of money and the parachutes.

98
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:09,493
When the 4 parachutes and the bag of money

99
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:10,871
was given to Cooper,

100
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:14,178
he allowed the passengers and flight attendants

101
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:15,832
to leave the plane

102
00:04:15,832 --> 00:04:17,442
except Tina Mucklow.

103
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:20,972
After this, according to the plan, the plane was refuelled

104
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:22,910
and it takes off again.

105
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,512
This time, only the pilots were on the plane

106
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:28,079
along with Cooper and Tina.

107
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,790
Cooper started giving instructions to the pilots again.

108
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,387
For the destination of the flight, the speed of the flight,

109
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:34,442
down to the very angle.

110
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:37,400
He directs them to fly the plane towards Mexico City.

111
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,261
At an altitude of 10,000 feet in the air.

112
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:42,800
With the wings positioned at 15°.

113
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,952
As for the plane's speed

114
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:46,050
he wanted to fly as slow as possible.

115
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:48,286
The pilots told Cooper that

116
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:49,762
flying with these configurations,

117
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:51,544
would make it difficult for them to reach Mexico City.

118
00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:53,180
Because there wasn't enough fuel in the plane.

119
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,961
But Cooper was not worried about it.

120
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,351
Cooper told them to fly as he directed.

121
00:04:57,351 --> 00:05:00,006
Friends, what happened next is completely unbelievable.

122
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:01,768
No less than a film's story.

123
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:05,480
Cooper told Tina to go to the cockpit and lock the door.

124
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,419
Cooper was the only person outside the cockpit.

125
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,568
He took out his parachutes and prepared to dive.

126
00:05:12,568 --> 00:05:13,934
A few minutes later,

127
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:16,133
a warning light flashed in the cockpit,

128
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:20,570
indicating that the rear staircase had been deployed.

129
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,101
This was a unique feature in these planes back then,

130
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:27,379
Boeing 727 planes had an aft staircase at the back.

131
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:29,615
In the photos, you can see how

132
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:32,246
the stairs deployed from the back.

133
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:34,184
Cooper deployed these stairs

134
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:37,121
and jumped out with the parachutes and the money.

135
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,756
The pilots and the air hostesses did not see this happening

136
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:47,174
because they were locked in the cockpit

137
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:50,390
and back then there was no hole on the cockpit door

138
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,868
through which they could see outside.

139
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:55,338
But at 8.13 pm, pilots noticed that

140
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:59,040
the back part of the plane suddenly tilted upwards

141
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,739
and the pilots had to recalibrate and re-level the plane.

142
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:07,605
After this, the pilots flew the plane to Nevada, 
and landed in the city of Reno.

143
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:09,777
The police were informed

144
00:06:09,777 --> 00:06:11,425
and they investigated the plane.

145
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:14,055
But they didn't find any trace of Cooper.

146
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:16,064
The only things the police could find was a tie

147
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:17,519
with a clip on it,

148
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,983
and some torn parts of the parachutes,

149
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:23,875
which Cooper had used to cover the bag of money.

150
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,596
Apart from this, they found some personal items belonging to Cooper,

151
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:28,795
like the cigarettes he was smoking on the plane.

152
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:31,263
Smoking was allowed in aeroplanes back then.

153
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,553
Investigators investigated everything thoroughly

154
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:48,059
and they found 66 unidentified fingerprints.

155
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:51,018
Fingerprints belonging to neither the crew members

156
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:53,143
nor to the other passengers.

157
00:06:53,143 --> 00:06:55,427
But the suitcase that had the b0mb,

158
00:06:55,427 --> 00:06:58,111
the bag of money, and the parachutes,

159
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:00,402
were all missing, like Cooper.

160
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:04,033
From that day, the FBI started its investigation to find Cooper,

161
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,558
but no trace of Cooper was found.

162
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:09,685
This investigation went on for 45 years.

163
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:12,071
It was officially closed in 2016,

164
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:14,100
but the answers to many questions

165
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,000
are still unanswered.

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,224
This is the only hijack in history

167
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:20,501
that no one has been able to solve.

168
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,535
One of the greatest mysteries for the FBI.

169
00:07:22,535 --> 00:07:24,405
Who was Cooper?

170
00:07:24,405 --> 00:07:25,800
What happened to him?

171
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,681
Was the money ever recovered by the police?

172
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,378
There are too many questions.

173
00:07:30,378 --> 00:07:32,229
Let's try to unravel this mystery.

174
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:45,805
2 things are very interesting about this incident.

175
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:48,463
First, during this hijack,

176
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:52,369
no other passenger knew that their plane was hijacked.

177
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:54,284
Neither was anyone k!lled

178
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:56,431
nor was anyone injured in this hijack.

179
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:59,560
Many people claim this was due to Tina Mucklow.

180
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,152
They call her the hero of this hijack

181
00:08:02,152 --> 00:08:04,219
because she was the one to ensure that

182
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:06,702
Cooper remained calm throughout the flight,

183
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:08,130
his demands were met,

184
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,802
and no panic situation could be created

185
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:13,149
which could cause a ruckus or get someone injured.

186
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:15,999
The co-pilot of the plane Rataczak later said,

187
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:18,140
"She was so calm and cool and collected,

188
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,322
I could not think of anyone

189
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:22,570
that would have been better 

190
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,694
to have sitting next to someone 
who would do a criminal act like [this]."

191
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:27,365
The second interesting thing was that

192
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:28,690
the name DB Cooper.

193
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,281
As I told you in the beginning,

194
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:32,539
that guy's name was actually Dan Cooper.

195
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,551
But today, most people

196
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:37,549
call this the Mystery of DB Cooper.

197
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:42,505
How did Dan become DB?

198
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:45,496
This is because of a mistake by a news reporter.

199
00:08:45,496 --> 00:08:47,746
Back then, there was a reporter named James Long

200
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:49,541
who was late for meeting his deadline.

201
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,080
So, in a hurry,

202
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,111
while talking to his police source,

203
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:54,926
he misheard the name.

204
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:56,691
The police said that

205
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:58,508
the hijacker's name was Dan Cooper

206
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:00,691
but this reporter heard DB Cooper

207
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:02,107
and used this name for his news report.

208
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:04,819
This report was picked up by other journalists

209
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:08,105
while talking about this news 
in their newspapers and channels

210
00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:10,583
started using the name DB Cooper.

211
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:16,652
[DB Cooper]

212
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:19,524
This is how the name of the hijacker changed.

213
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:22,875
In psychology, this phenomenon is known as Anchoring, 

214
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,981
Anchoring is a cognitive bias that states,

215
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:30,038
humans rely too heavily on the first piece of information. 

216
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:34,210
The first piece of news you hear about any breaking news,

217
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,142
you have the tendency to believe it.

218
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:40,552
In 2013, a joke theory related to this was published,

219
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:42,209
Brandolini's Law,

220
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,152
also called the Bullshit Asymmetry Principle.

221
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:48,914
It states that correcting this anchoring effect can be very difficult.

222
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:51,916
"The amount of energy needed to correct bullshit,

223
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,531
is of much higher magnitude than to produce it."

224
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:56,120
In broad terms,

225
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,250
spreading lies is relatively easier,

226
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,100
but having people believe the truth to correct that lie,

227
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,505
is much more difficult.

228
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,159
But in case of Cooper,

229
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,465
it wasn't a huge mistake.

230
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:09,105
Only the name was wrong.

231
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:13,461
Anyway, a hijacker shouldn't be expected to use his real name.

232
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,314
FBI's initial investigations showed that

233
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:18,364
when Cooper jumped out of the plane,

234
00:10:18,364 --> 00:10:22,245
Cooper had strapped the cash around him.

235
00:10:22,245 --> 00:10:24,393
The cash weighed around 10 kilos.

236
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,217
Cooper used two parachutes to jump,

237
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:33,120
one strapped in front and one behind.

238
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,890
The police had an idea of the area in which Cooper jumped.

239
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,909
He jumped in the southwest area of Washington State.

240
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:47,006
There were pine forests, lakes, and canyons in the area,

241
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:48,449
bears lived there.

242
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:50,621
So, in the beginning, the investigators said that

243
00:10:50,621 --> 00:10:52,709
there was no chance of Cooper surviving.

244
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:55,283
Jumping from a height of 10,000 feet

245
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:56,968
and in pitch darkness.

246
00:10:56,968 --> 00:10:59,193
It was completely dark at 8 in the night.

247
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,258
Second, the clothes that Cooper was wearing

248
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:03,446
were not at all suitable for jumping.

249
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:05,316
Jumping in pants and shirt

250
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:07,706
when it was raining outside.

251
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:09,588
With heavy, black clouds in the sky,

252
00:11:09,588 --> 00:11:11,150
at the height of 5,000 feet.

253
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,111
It means that Cooper could not see anything while falling.

254
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,733
On top of that, the wind speed was important too.

255
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:23,501
It was estimated that when Cooper jumped,

256
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:26,279
he had to be travelling at the speed of 320 km per hour.

257
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,636
The United States Parachute Association believed that

258
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:30,987
there was another problem on top of all this,

259
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:32,520
the cold water.

260
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,530
In November, the temperature 
in this American region is very low.

261
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,473
If Cooper had fallen into a lake,

262
00:11:38,473 --> 00:11:40,543
it would have been almost impossible to escape from there.

263
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:43,996
In such cold water, hypothermia 
would have set in within a few minutes.

264
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,914
And on top of that, the weight strapped on Cooper,

265
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,840
would have made it more difficult to swim.

266
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,235
But despite all these,

267
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:52,068
some such reasons surfaced later,

268
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:54,139
which force us to think that

269
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:57,495
perhaps Cooper survived this jump.

270
00:11:57,495 --> 00:12:00,199
The reason for this was that after Cooper's incident,

271
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:03,093
there were many similar incidents.

272
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:06,338
When Cooper's hijacking made news all across the country,

273
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:09,839
more hijackers thought of using the same tactics.

274
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,783
At least 5 people did the same copycat hijackings.

275
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:15,384
And all these 5 people

276
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:18,274
survived after jumping off the plane.

277
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:20,241
One of them was Martin McNally,

278
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:23,978
who hijacked a plane on 24th June 1972.

279
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:26,575
He used the exact same modus operandi.

280
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:28,931
He demanded a sum of $500,000.

281
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:30,399
When the plane took off,

282
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,280
they used a parachute to jump off like Cooper.

283
00:12:36,327 --> 00:12:40,493
In McNally's case, the speed of the plane 
was around 400-500 km per hour

284
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,000
when he jumped.

285
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,090
This was twice the speed of Cooper's dive.

286
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,998
But still, McNally survived his jump

287
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:50,203
using only a reserve parachute.

288
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:54,025
Another similar hijack was done in January 1972

289
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:55,375
by Richard Lapoint.

290
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,322
He wore similar clothes in January,

291
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:01,473
jumped and landed safely in the snow.

292
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,575
It's irrelevant that these two hijackers

293
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,946
were later caught by the police.

294
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:06,276
That's how we know their stories.

295
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:08,002
But the FBI thought that

296
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:10,021
if these people could jump

297
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:12,011
in conditions that were worse than when Cooper jumped,

298
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:13,348
and they managed to survive,

299
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:17,276
then it was possible that DB Cooper survived that night.

300
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:19,590
Especially if you consider that

301
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,238
when Tina Mucklow gave the parachutes to Cooper,

302
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:24,840
there were instructions on how to use them.

303
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,876
But Cooper told Tina that

304
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:28,845
she didn't need to read the instructions.

305
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:30,356
He knew how to use them.

306
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:32,574
So now, since the FBI started assuming that

307
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:34,143
Cooper could be alive,

308
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:35,896
their next task was to

309
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:39,332
search the place where he had jumped.

310
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:45,112
Actually, the police had started searching 
those jungles the day after the hijack.

311
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:49,521
The police were looking for a body, a torn piece of the parachutes,

312
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:52,317
or a $20 bill.

313
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:54,278
At the beginning of the video, I told you

314
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:56,606
that the money given to Cooper was special.

315
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,269
The special thing was that

316
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:00,000
there were $20 bills.

317
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:03,109
10,000 notes of $20,

318
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,497
$200,000 in total.

319
00:14:04,497 --> 00:14:07,590
And the serial numbers of these notes

320
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,868
were noted down by the bank.

321
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,613
The FBI spread the list of serial numbers throughout the country.

322
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:15,090
From banks to casinos,

323
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:20,177
everyone was told to inform the FBI 
if they got the notes of those serial numbers.

324
00:14:20,177 --> 00:14:23,692
But it was becoming more and more 
difficult for the investigators to find Copper

325
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:26,282
because where could the search area be drawn?

326
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,936
There were many variables.

327
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:30,521
What was the wind speed while the plane was flying?

328
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:31,831
How dark was it?

329
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:33,541
What was the exact location of the plane

330
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,096
when Cooper jumped?

331
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:38,555
After jumping, at what height did Cooper deploy his parachutes?

332
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:41,832
And in which directions could the parachutes have gone?

333
00:14:41,832 --> 00:14:44,160
The investigators' best estimate was that

334
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,031
it would have landed somewhere 
near Lake Merwin in Washington State.

335
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:50,450
The FBI ran a practical experiment.

336
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,658
If we fly the same aircraft with the same configurations

337
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:59,884
and push out a 91 kg sled through the stairs,

338
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:01,864
based on where the sled landed,

339
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:04,285
we can get a better idea of

340
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:06,934
the area where Cooper could have landed.

341
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:10,827
Due to this, door-to-door searches were conducted in this area.

342
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,431
The local farmhouses,

343
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:15,062
the police used to knock on every door

344
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:17,337
to investigate and to ask people.

345
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:20,815
Petrol boats were running on Lake Mervin and Lake Yale.

346
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:24,538
One company used their submarine for the search.

347
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:28,155
200 ft under the Lake Mervin,

348
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:29,735
they continued to look for him.

349
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:33,766
They wanted to find either the money, 
a piece of the parachute or a body

350
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,327
but they couldn't find anything.

351
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:36,874
Eventually, the investigators

352
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:41,350
published the serial numbers of the notes in the local newspaper.

353
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,172
They ran the news that the first person 
to find a note from those serial numbers

354
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:48,434
would be awarded $1,000.

355
00:15:48,434 --> 00:15:50,495
This offer remained for 3 years

356
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:53,196
but not a single note could be found.

357
00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:55,780
Now let's skip to 1979.

358
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,901
8 years since the hijack.

359
00:15:57,901 --> 00:16:01,556
Suddenly a pilot contacted the FBI.

360
00:16:01,556 --> 00:16:05,423
His name was Tom Bohan 
and he worked for Continental Airlines.

361
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,358
The night of the hijack,

362
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:11,443
4 minutes behind Cooper's aircraft 
and 4,000 feet above,

363
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:13,152
another aircraft was flying,

364
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:15,209
which was being flown by Tom.

365
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,271
Tom recalled the storm that night,

366
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:21,937
and said that he had never seen 
such a storm in his entire career.

367
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:25,207
He said that the FBI's calculations

368
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:26,417
regarding Cooper's drop zone

369
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:28,350
were off by 80°.

370
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,501
Since he was on a plane that night,

371
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:33,892
he had a better idea of where Copper landed.

372
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,674
He told FBI that

373
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:39,918
they should be searching near the drainage area of the Washougal River.

374
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:43,447
A few months later, Tom's suspicion was proven right.

375
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:45,121
An 8-year-old boy

376
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:48,802
found some $20 notes lying on the bank of the Columbia River.

377
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:51,696
All of these were $20 bills,

378
00:16:51,696 --> 00:16:54,946
and some of them were still in bundles held together with rubber bands.

379
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:57,043
"Hijacker DB Cooper,

380
00:16:57,043 --> 00:17:01,539
the first break in the only unsolved 
airplane hijacking in United States history 

381
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:03,082
came on a Columbia River beach.

382
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:05,578
An 8-year-old boy dug up the shreds of

383
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:07,291
$3,000 on Sunday!"

384
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:10,983
As soon as the police checked the serial numbers of these notes,

385
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:13,060
it was immediately confirmed that

386
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,002
this was the same money from years ago,

387
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,319
that was given to Cooper.

388
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,165
Another search was conducted around this place

389
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,075
but they couldn't find all of the money.

390
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,986
In total, they could find only $5,800.

391
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:26,862
And Tom's hypothesis

392
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:29,310
of Cooper landing in this area

393
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,757
was proved correct.

394
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:34,042
Tom had said that Cooper must have 
landed somewhere near the Washougal river.

395
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:37,636
And the money found was downstream of the same river.

396
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:41,604
After this, the FBI searched the area in the hope of

397
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:44,818
finding a body or some pieces of the parachute.

398
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:46,321
But they couldn't find anything.

399
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:48,278
FBI agent Richard Tosaw believed that

400
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:52,021
Cooper must have drowned in the 
cold water of the river that night.

401
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:53,888
An interesting fact here was that

402
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:56,467
the 8-year-old boy who found these notes

403
00:17:56,467 --> 00:18:00,038
was given some portions of these notes as a reward.

404
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,637
And in 2008, when the boy grew up,

405
00:18:02,637 --> 00:18:06,063
he sold 15 notes in an online auction.

406
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:08,284
And in return for these $20 notes,

407
00:18:08,284 --> 00:18:10,370
he got $37,000.

408
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,235
Because Cooper's case was so popular all over the world

409
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:16,859
people were ready to pay such a high amount for these notes.

410
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:18,829
Another big question that arises is that

411
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:21,641
regardless of what happened to Cooper 
after jumping from the plane,

412
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:23,927
who was Cooper actually?

413
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:27,016
By the way, if you like flight mystery videos

414
00:18:27,016 --> 00:18:29,344
and you want to listen to them in audio form,

415
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:32,583
then I have some good suggestions for audiobooks on Kuku FM.

416
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,629
One is on MS 370
Biggest Mystery in Aviation.

417
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:38,886
And the other audiobook is 
The Impossible Rescue.

418
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:40,971
It's the most fun to listen to them when

419
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:42,641
you are doing some chore at home

420
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:44,098
or going for a walk outside.

421
00:18:44,098 --> 00:18:45,444
Or before going to sleep at night.

422
00:18:45,444 --> 00:18:47,436
Because you can rest your eyes

423
00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:48,992
as it is only for listening.

424
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,048
If you don't know, Kuku FM is an amazing platform for audio-learning

425
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,706
where you will find many such audiobooks on almost every topic.

426
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:59,455
Whether it's history, mystery, politics or fiction.

427
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,477
If you haven't downloaded it yet,

428
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:03,305
you can find the link in the description below

429
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:06,797
and you will also get a special 
50% off coupon code in the link.

430
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:08,414
You can go and check it out.

431
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:09,766
Now let's get back to the topic.

432
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:12,077
We must have some background information

433
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:13,484
about where this guy came from

434
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:14,865
and what was his identity.

435
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:18,470
The FBI did not have much to help answer this question.

436
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,662
There was a tie and tie clip left behind by Cooper.

437
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,536
That tie clip was actually golden

438
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:24,809
and in that tie clip,

439
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:27,857
they found some specific microscopic particles.

440
00:19:27,857 --> 00:19:30,463
In March 2009, a research team

441
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:33,043
started researching these microscopic particles

442
00:19:33,043 --> 00:19:34,341
using new technology.

443
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,756
There was a palaeontologist on this team,

444
00:19:36,756 --> 00:19:38,402
a scientific illustrator,

445
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:39,459
and a metallurgist. 

446
00:19:39,459 --> 00:19:43,535
They used electron microscopy to examine these particles.

447
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:47,128
Some portions of the tie-clip were of unalloyed titanium,

448
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:50,127
with traces of aluminium, and titanium antimony alloy.

449
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:52,087
Their findings suggested that

450
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:55,511
Cooper worked in a chemical 
or metal manufacturing plant

451
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:58,381
or in an aeronautical engineering company.

452
00:19:58,381 --> 00:20:01,031
Maybe he worked in Boeing itself.

453
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:04,691
Because the unalloyed titanium that was used in the tie-clip,

454
00:20:04,691 --> 00:20:08,755
back then, it was used in aircraft fabrication facilities.

455
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:11,884
"The Periodical Table of clue, say scientists,

456
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:15,098
suggest that Cooper had access to a manufacturing company

457
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:16,405
that made airplanes.

458
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:18,125
Like the one he jumped from.

459
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,880
Perhaps a company with a connection to Boeing."

460
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,674
In the first year of the investigation,

461
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:25,839
FBI talked to the passengers and flight crew

462
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,462
to make a sketch of Cooper's face.

463
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:30,470
What did Cooper look like?

464
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:36,917
The first sketch created by
28th November 1971, looked like this.

465
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:39,759
But Air Hostess Schaffer and many witnesses said that

466
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,479
it was not an accurate representation.

467
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:44,133
It took another year to make a new sketch.

468
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:47,103
This wasn't very accurate either.

469
00:20:47,103 --> 00:20:48,925
And on 2nd January 1973,

470
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:52,068
the FBI made their third and final sketch of Cooper.

471
00:20:52,068 --> 00:20:53,658
After seeing this new sketch,

472
00:20:53,658 --> 00:20:56,664
an air hostess said that this photo was accurate.

473
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:59,133
Looking at this drawing, it can be easily said that

474
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,660
Cooper looked like this.

475
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,014
Dan Cooper's real face

476
00:21:02,014 --> 00:21:03,540
and his possible profession

477
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,964
was revealed to the world.

478
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,363
Many people started making new theories

479
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:08,785
about his identity.

480
00:21:08,785 --> 00:21:10,869
About who Cooper was.

481
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:14,896
Larry Carr, who had led the 
investigative team from 2006-2009

482
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:19,629
believed that Cooper was an aircraft cargo loader in the Air Force.

483
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:22,600
Because cargo loaders were given basic jump training.

484
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,580
How to wear parachutes,

485
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,436
how to deploy parachutes.

486
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:28,097
And even on the working of the plane,

487
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:29,795
how to deploy the stairs in the plane,

488
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:30,856
they know all this.

489
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,378
Based on these descriptions,

490
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:35,158
the FBI released a list of more than 800 suspects.

491
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:36,463
800 people,

492
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,090
any of them could be DB Cooper.

493
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,580
But 20 of them were seriously considered.

494
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,740
2-3 of them have interesting stories.

495
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,507
One of them was Richard McCoy,

496
00:21:45,507 --> 00:21:47,541
an army veteran of the Vietnam War.

497
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,752
5 months after the Cooper's hijack,

498
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:51,358
he hijacked a plane

499
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:53,252
in a manner eerily similar to Cooper's.

500
00:21:53,252 --> 00:21:54,599
A Boeing 727 plane,

501
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:58,016
he demanded 4 parachutes and $500,000.

502
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,252
"The young man wanted $500,000

503
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,492
and requested 4 parachutes."

504
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,603
After taking the money, he deployed the rear stairs,

505
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:07,628
and jumped.

506
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:08,928
But the only difference was that

507
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,576
just two days after the hijack,

508
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:12,764
the FBI found him and arrested him.

509
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,003
He was sentenced to 45 years in jail

510
00:22:15,003 --> 00:22:17,597
and the FBI thought that he was Cooper.

511
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:20,336
And that this was his second attempt at hijacking.

512
00:22:20,336 --> 00:22:23,305
"He was arrested here in his home in Provo, Utah,

513
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:24,200
early this morning.

514
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,877
When the FBI men came,

515
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,078
he did not resist."

516
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,691
In 1991, a book was published,

517
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:31,714
DB Cooper, The Real McCoy.

518
00:22:31,714 --> 00:22:34,816
Written by former FBI agent, Russell Caleme.

519
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:37,475
This book states that when McCoy's family

520
00:22:37,475 --> 00:22:40,863
was shown the tie and tie clip belonging to Cooper,

521
00:22:40,863 --> 00:22:43,012
they believed that those were McCoy's.

522
00:22:43,012 --> 00:22:44,985
But when McCoy was asked

523
00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:46,336
if he was DB Cooper,

524
00:22:46,336 --> 00:22:49,875
he refused to admit or deny it.

525
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:51,688
After spending 2 years in jail,

526
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:53,839
McCoy attempted a jailbreak

527
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,641
which led to a shootout

528
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:56,852
in which he was killed.

529
00:22:56,852 --> 00:22:58,324
After hearing all this, you may feel that

530
00:22:58,324 --> 00:23:00,245
the mystery is solved.

531
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:03,293
But there are more twists in our story.

532
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:07,367
Today, the FBI does not officially consider McCoy as DB Cooper.

533
00:23:07,662 --> 00:23:09,164
There are 2 major reasons behind this.

534
00:23:09,164 --> 00:23:11,207
First, based on the sketch they made,

535
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:16,103
the description of DB Cooper does not match McCoy.

536
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,032
Second, the FBI later found evidence 

537
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:22,425
of McCoy's whereabouts during the night of Cooper's hijacking.

538
00:23:22,425 --> 00:23:24,253
He was in Las Vegas.

539
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:27,352
The next day, he was at his home with his family.

540
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:29,421
Since there is evidence of this,

541
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:31,077
it is clear that

542
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,014
McCoy cannot be DB Cooper.

543
00:23:33,014 --> 00:23:34,711
The second suspect was

544
00:23:34,711 --> 00:23:37,295
a Vietnam War veteran named Robert Rackstraw.

545
00:23:37,295 --> 00:23:39,698
He was arrested multiple times for fraud,

546
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:41,928
aircraft theft, and possession of explosives.

547
00:23:41,928 --> 00:23:45,032
But he was always found not guilty after the arrest.

548
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:48,472
TV producer Thomas Colbert wrote a book in 2016,

549
00:23:48,472 --> 00:23:50,532
The Last Master Outlaw.

550
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:54,049
To prove that Rackstraw was DB Cooper.

551
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:56,895
He made a documentary on History Channel,

552
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,661
DB Cooper: Case Closed

553
00:23:58,661 --> 00:24:00,540
where he said the same thing.

554
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,398
Colbert worked with a team of 40 people,

555
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:05,491
including many former FBI agents.

556
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:08,869
All of them believed that Rackstraw was the real DB Cooper.

557
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:10,219
What is the evidence for this?

558
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:13,739
When FBI began the investigation in the 1970s,

559
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:17,181
Rackstraw was high on the list of initial suspects.

560
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:21,133
In those days, Rackstraw used to give joke comments to the media

561
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,666
on the possibility that he was the hijacker.

562
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,608
However, many years later,

563
00:24:25,608 --> 00:24:27,214
he denied these claims.

564
00:24:27,214 --> 00:24:30,970
His face matched the sketches.

565
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,032
But the FBI let him go after 1979

566
00:24:35,032 --> 00:24:36,666
and removed him from the suspect list

567
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:38,490
because they couldn't get substantial evidence.

568
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:40,644
TV producer Colbert believed that

569
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:42,907
the FBI should have kept investigating this guy.

570
00:24:42,907 --> 00:24:45,709
With more FBI investigation,

571
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:46,917
they could have uncovered the evidence.

572
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:49,110
While on 11th July 2016,

573
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,434
Colbert launched his new book on DB Cooper,

574
00:24:52,434 --> 00:24:55,657
the next day, on 12th July 2016,

575
00:24:55,657 --> 00:24:58,015
the FBI closed the case.

576
00:24:58,408 --> 00:25:00,960
In 2016, Rackstraw was 73 years old

577
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,745
and because of the allegations against him in this book,

578
00:25:03,745 --> 00:25:06,306
he lost his job.

579
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:08,172
Later in 2019,

580
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:11,666
he passed away due to natural causes.

581
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:14,464
So, friends, we are back at the same point.

582
00:25:14,824 --> 00:25:17,463
Even today, this mystery of DB Cooper

583
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:19,561
is an unsolved mystery.

584
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,901
No one knows who was DB Cooper,

585
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:23,158
where did he come from

586
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:24,573
and where did he go.

587
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:26,165
Now that you know about this mystery, what do you think?

588
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,005
That night when DB Cooper jumped off the plane,

589
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:33,203
could Cooper survive that jump or not?

590
00:25:33,203 --> 00:25:34,927
Write in the comments below.

591
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:36,949
It is quite surprising that

592
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:38,320
after Cooper's hijacking,

593
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,016
there were many similar hijackings.

594
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:42,419
But in all those hijackings,

595
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,744
the hijackers who used parachutes to jump off the plane,

596
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,014
first of all, he always survived.

597
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:52,584
And second, he was always caught by the police or FBI.

598
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,784
But what about Cooper?

599
00:25:59,452 --> 00:26:00,462
If you liked this video,

600
00:26:00,462 --> 00:26:03,074
I have made more videos on such mysteries.

601
00:26:03,074 --> 00:26:05,214
I created a playlist of mystery videos.
