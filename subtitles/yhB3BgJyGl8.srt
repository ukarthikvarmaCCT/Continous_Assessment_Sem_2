1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,236
We are now stranded on
a raft in the middle of the ocean

2
00:00:03,327 --> 00:00:04,661
and there goes our boat.

3
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,606
We are now stranded for seven days.

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,975
- How much longer?
- Seven days.

5
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:09,759
Frick.

6
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:12,101
This raft is literally countless
miles

7
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:14,047
from the nearest civilization.

8
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,582
And whether we like it or not,

9
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:18,084
my four friends and I
are stuck on this raft.

10
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:21,087
And it's not going to be easy.
This is brutal.

11
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,391
It won't stop raining!
We're all at rock bottom now.

12
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,793
This challenge went from fun
to a literal nightmare.

13
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,261
Very fast.

14
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,831
Bro, look how far away the boat is.

15
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:32,932
I can't even see it anymore.

16
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,534
So, step one.

17
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,375
We're going to get sunburned
if we don't get shade.

18
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:38,038
And I had survival specialists

19
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,041
equip this raft with tons of wood,
rope and everything else.

20
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,842
We would need to build ourselves
a shelter.

21
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,213
Boys, we need to get started.
We are running out of light!

22
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:47,414
I got this. My finger!

23
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,616
Now, we set these up like a teepee.

24
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,386
We picked the worst day to start.

25
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:53,464
As you can tell by the clouds, it's
literally about the storm.

26
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:59,659
So, first thing we want to do
is set up some structure to cover us.

27
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:00,226
Also,

28
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:02,295
since we're on this slab of wood
for the next seven days,

29
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:03,763
we need a place to hide
from the sun

30
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,931
so we don't get sunburned.

31
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,199
So two birds, one stone.

32
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,535
Speaking of birds,
while we were building,

33
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,003
- this happened.
- A bird!

34
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:13,039
- It's coming right at us!
- Oh, my god! It's a bird!

35
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,109
Yes!

36
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,011
This is crazy.

37
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,379
- We should name him.
- What's his name?

38
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,107
Bryan. Bryan. Bryan. Bryan.

39
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:23,783
What if you went and got some fish?

40
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,652
I know, he's looking at me.
He understands.

41
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,921
- Jimmy, just say the word.
- Put the knife away.

42
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,623
- Okay. I'll put the knife away.
- And the hatchet.

43
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,493
Bryan, that was a joke.

44
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,295
Forget the bird.
We got to build a shelter.

45
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,030
- We're making friends.
- While Bryan watched,

46
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,849
We worked on our first shelter
for the rest of the day.

47
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:41,234
Except for my friend Tareq,

48
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,336
who spent the entire day
getting cool drone shots.

49
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:45,422
And I'm not even mad about it.

50
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,908
Inside this crate is the food for all

51
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,144
five of us for the next seven days.

52
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,245
Oh, my God.

53
00:01:53,036 --> 00:01:54,071
And in these two barrels

54
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,240
is our entire water supply
for all five of us.

55
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,651
How does it taste?

56
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,821
Very hot. We're screwed.

57
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:03,790
There was dirt in my cup.

58
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,626
It's getting dark, and that crate
has the word "sleep" on it.

59
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,895
Hopefully, the survival guides
gave us something soft.

60
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,731
- Why are they wet?
- Things do get wet on a boat.

61
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,300
I'm ready for bed.
I wanna go to sleep.

62
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:18,471
This is night one,
and Bryan is just yawning.

63
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,874
This is miserable.

64
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,876
This is all the coverage we have.

65
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,645
I didn't realize what I was
signing up for. It's hot.

66
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,348
This thing will not stop swaying,
and I feel like I'm going to puke.

67
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,517
And I'm surrounded by a bunch
of sweaty people

68
00:02:30,573 --> 00:02:31,741
Aye, sweaty men.

69
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,520
If you guys
smell this bad on day one,

70
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,178
what are you going
to smell like on day 7?

71
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,489
Oh, gosh.

72
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:42,195
Our first night of sleep
was really rough.

73
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,433
Sleeping is impossible.

74
00:02:44,476 --> 00:02:46,232
These waves are just making me
miserable.

75
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:49,069
And to make matters worse,
our best friend Bryan ended up

76
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:50,303
leaving us that morning.

77
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,006
-Bryan!
-Bryan!

78
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,274
Bryan!

79
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,976
But regardless, today's
objective is to build ourselves

80
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,112
a permanent weatherproof shelter.

81
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,115
How do we turn that
into a livable structure?

82
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,950
There's definitely something here.

83
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,819
Luckily, I had them throw
a bunch of wood on the raft

84
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,655
so we could build a nice house.

85
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:09,923
How we build the house?

86
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,725
I'm not quite sure, but they said
this is enough to build a house.

87
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,994
But ironically,
right as we got started,

88
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:18,065
- It's raining!
- Don't throw it!

89
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,667
Jimmy, get my shark pillow!

90
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,904
This is miserable!

91
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,606
This is bad.

92
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,107
Oh, Jesus Christ.

93
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,754
You're not doing
the right thing, Nolan.

94
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:32,111
- Listen with your ears!
- Why do you yell so much!

95
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,147
- Because you don't listen!
- I wanna hit Nolan!

96
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,515
- It's just rain.
- Shut up!

97
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,116
At least we don't have to shower.

98
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,818
Yeah. This is so bad.

99
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,287
And we still have over
six days left.

100
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:43,690
Where do we go poop?

101
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,725
- Oh, we have to build the pooper.
- What?

102
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,694
-We have to build everything
that's here.

103
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,895
We have to build the toilet.

104
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,064
Build our shelter,
the fire, everything.

105
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,465
The moment the rain finished,

106
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,435
the boys and I needed to build
all of our survival essentials.

107
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,136
Starting with the shelter.

108
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,505
Tearing it down in the name
of something better.

109
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,745
Five minute break for Chris.

110
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,113
I also need a break.

111
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,582
I'm seasick. I'm out of it.

112
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,284
You got to pick this up. I can't.

113
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,485
I can't pick it up anymore.

114
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,454
I feel like
you're doing all the work,

115
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,624
but we got two other goofs
just laying down.

116
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,691
I'm miserable.

117
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,159
We built one wall.

118
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,629
- Yeah, we built one wall.
- All together.

119
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,363
All of us.

120
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:24,897
Regardless of being seasick,

121
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,767
it was going to take all of us
if we wanted to finish this.

122
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,970
Now, you guys
bring it forward. There we go.

123
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,238
Let's go!

124
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,941
How many YouTubers does it take
to build a little structure?

125
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,543
Wait? Is that a whale?

126
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,346
Think that's a whale?
That's insane.

127
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,414
Oh, my God.

128
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,182
- It's unreal.
- There are actually whales.

129
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,018
This experience
just keeps getting better.

130
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,154
Shelter, water, not being near Nolan.

131
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,224
I'm never going to take that
for granted again.

132
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,694
Probably would have been really
useful to build the ladder first.

133
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:59,024
We got a ladder. I literally
just built just 4 minutes ago.

134
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:02,345
After hours of building,
we were finally getting somewhere.

135
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,339
I severely regret
making this a seven day challenge

136
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,740
instead of a 50 hour challenge.

137
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,310
Like all our other videos.
We keep rocking back and forth.

138
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,160
It's freakin' miserable.
I'm going to puke.

139
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:14,673
And finally, just as
the sun was going down…

140
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,084
- Camp is now organized.
- Yeah!

141
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:22,522
Night two, my bed is still broken,
but I'm going to get some sleep

142
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,735
tonight because I'm that tired.

143
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,659
I'm gonna head to bead.
Did I wake you?

144
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:27,560
Yeah.

145
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,329
Just go back to bed,
I'm just vlogging.

146
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,431
I accidentally woke Lazar up,
I feel bad now.

147
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,066
This might be the most tired

148
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,768
I've ever been in my entire life.

149
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:40,163
It's now day three.

150
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,308
And somehow our building
didn't fall over.

151
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,643
I'll take that as a dub.

152
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,445
The noises that the structure made

153
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,080
while I was sleeping last night,

154
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,715
filled me with nightmares.

155
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,574
It's day three and we've really
started to get into a rhythm.

156
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,087
Our morning routine
consisted of peeing in the corner,

157
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,788
- Bro, who vlogs in the pee corner?

158
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,367
I'm not moving.

159
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:00,960
- eating our breakfast,
- Surviving on Feastables.

160
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,861
It's all you need?

161
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,563
and drinking hot barrel water.

162
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,832
So dehydrated, I need this.

163
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,868
We're about 36 hours in
and we're almost halfway

164
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,437
- through a barrel of water.
- Is that slow or fast.

165
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,307
We're going to run out on day six.

166
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,543
Running low on water
and food gave me an idea.

167
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,046
I'm kind of curious to see
what's under the boat people do.

168
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,532
There's so many fish below us!

169
00:06:22,575 --> 00:06:23,816
So we decided

170
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:27,019
to try and catch some dinner,
but we weren't very good at it.

171
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:28,254
Why does it take so long?

172
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,490
I just want something
to put my stomach.

173
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:31,522
Bryan!

174
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,157
Bryan, help us catch fish!

175
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,647
Bryan!

176
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,241
Turns out fishing is a lot harder
than YouTube.

177
00:06:37,284 --> 00:06:40,283
After hours,
we caught absolutely nothing.

178
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,404
Why can't we catch anything?
Oh, I give up.

179
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:44,866
We were tired,
dehydrated and hungry.

180
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,734
Which forced us to dig
into our rations.

181
00:06:46,777 --> 00:06:48,040
Let's have ourselves a feast.

182
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:51,453
Yeah! Call it a Feast-ables.

183
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:53,045
Aye!

184
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:54,047
In our supplies,

185
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,659
We had wood to build a fire
and pans to cook with.

186
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,451
You take big stick
and make really little sticks

187
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,821
and then make medium sticks.

188
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,190
Then use the big sticks at the end.

189
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,455
Look at them beans, baby!

190
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,366
I'm so excited.
This looks awesome.

191
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:15,088
-These are really good.
-Can you tell we've been

192
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:16,301
at sea for three days?

193
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,870
- Literally.
- When have I ever been this excited

194
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:19,095
over canned chili?

195
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,706
Hey, I put some love into this one.

196
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:22,250
It's not just canned chili anymore.

197
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:24,396
It's got tomatoes, kidney beans.

198
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:25,878
You don't have to keep talking.
I'm already drooling.

199
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:26,845
This was our first

200
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,616
hot meal in days, but it was also
a good chunk of our rations,

201
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:32,117
so we made sure to enjoy it.

202
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:33,085
I feel a lot better.

203
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,721
I think the first two days
were definitely the most miserable.

204
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:37,589
I think we're slowly,
like losing our minds

205
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:38,900
and it's actually becoming
bearable.

206
00:07:38,943 --> 00:07:40,726
I still haven't gone
to the bathroom.

207
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,604
That's my biggest concern,
you know?

208
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:51,904
I'm struggling to sleep.

209
00:07:51,947 --> 00:07:54,783
This raft is just rocking
like crazy.

210
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:58,845
Definitely I'm kind of miserable.

211
00:07:59,132 --> 00:08:00,300
Hopefully tomorrow is better.

212
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:03,773
None of us managed to get any sleep.

213
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,617
We lost the back of our
fort last night.

214
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,462
The house needs some repairs.

215
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,922
Tensions are pretty high
on the raft this morning.

216
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,757
Nolan's a little upset.
He broke his bed.

217
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,791
Oh, my God.

218
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,359
Nolan is struggling.

219
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:16,128
He's just in his feels right now.

220
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,162
It'll be okay.

221
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:21,033
He probably would've
quit the channel if I did that.

222
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,635
This is easily the worst.

223
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,428
Oh, there's thunder.

224
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,239
I swear.
If it starts raining again…

225
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:28,393
Oh, I can't take that.

226
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:29,625
And to make matters worse,

227
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:32,285
we accidentally dropped our ladle
in the drinking water.

228
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:34,156
And since we haven't showered
in four days,

229
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:36,739
grabbing it technically
contaminated the drinking water.

230
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,407
I'm never drinking out of that
again.

231
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,985
Fast forward
to when we run out of water.

232
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,320
Because of the contamination,

233
00:08:41,353 --> 00:08:43,822
a third of our water
was no longer safe to drink.

234
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:46,401
Whatever reason, the more I suffer,
the more you guys watch

235
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:47,656
some of our most popular videos.

236
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:50,762
are when I buried myself alive,
spent time in solitary confinement.

237
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:53,031
So I hope you're happy.
I'm suffering again.

238
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:56,748
It's not easy surviving on a raft,
but after four long days,

239
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,237
Lazar's finally pooping.

240
00:08:58,897 --> 00:09:00,432
Can you play a celebratory song?

241
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:06,979
LazarBeam is

242
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:08,547
- pooping.
- Is pooping.

243
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,516
See how all those clouds
over there are dark?

244
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,327
Yeah.

245
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,585
Yeah. They're going to pour
down on us tonight.

246
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,464
Tonight's going to suck.

247
00:09:14,507 --> 00:09:15,290
We didn't know it yet,

248
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,747
but the biggest storm of the entire
challenge was headed right

249
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,415
towards us.

250
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,575
And when we saw it approaching,

251
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:22,518
we tried to prepare
as much as possible

252
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,997
Can't wait for another storm
just to destroy all this again.

253
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,143
Tareq's
fixing his side of the fort.

254
00:09:27,186 --> 00:09:29,689
Chris is fixing the roof,
and I'm now the cameraman

255
00:09:29,732 --> 00:09:30,433
for some reason.

256
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:32,504
There's a storm-a-brewing.

257
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:34,667
And while they're
preparing the shelter

258
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,093
for the storm,
I'm going to tell you about Shopify

259
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:39,711
because it might literally storm
until the end of the challenge.

260
00:09:39,754 --> 00:09:42,057
This is going to be a bit rocky.

261
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:44,907
Shopify is a platform
that makes it easy for anyone

262
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,751
to start a business.

263
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,320
They literally support
millions of small businesses

264
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:50,189
all around the world,
from selling wood

265
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,124
to nails, to crates to...

266
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:55,160
Crocs, they support
businesses that sell it on Shopify.

267
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,596
Assuming we're going to have
absolutely zero tops

268
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:58,830
covering this structure,

269
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,232
I am worried about it.

270
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:03,468
100% of what I sell online
from merch to Feastables,

271
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:04,546
I do with Shopify.

272
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,005
It's actually getting pretty rocky
out here.

273
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,154
- The wind is getting crazy!
- We're out of nails!

274
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:11,743
It's really hard to work
around the wind, guys.

275
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,624
Stop yelling and do things!

276
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:16,642
Shopify even has a new AI tool
called Sidekick,

277
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:18,841
making running
your entire business easier.

278
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,076
Just like surviving on this
raft can be hard,

279
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,411
so can entrepreneurship.

280
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:24,079
And that's why
they do everything in their power

281
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:25,757
to make it as easy as possible.

282
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,260
- This is my worst nightmare.
- I'm so miserable!

283
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,386
Go to Shopify.com/MrBeast

284
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,577
to give it a try right now.
Thank you, Shopify.

285
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:34,056
Let's go prep for the storm.

286
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:35,300
I'm soaking wet!

287
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,111
Maybe you can start
helping us, Jimmy.

288
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:39,137
I was paying for the raft!

289
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:42,241
The storm was really
starting to pick up

290
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,309
but that night,
it got so much worse.

291
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,995
This really puts the helter
in the shelter, right?

292
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:49,881
Oh no, you!

293
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:50,874
Are you kidding me?

294
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,251
- It's leaking!
- Oh, no...

295
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,686
This shelter is the opposite
of waterproof.

296
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,256
This is brutal.

297
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:58,056
What do we do?

298
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,258
We have three more...

299
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:01,760
The next three days, by the way.

300
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,762
- No!
- There's water everywhere.

301
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:04,796
It's useless.

302
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:05,998
This does nothing.

303
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,377
This is the most insane night yet.

304
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,636
We are struggling right now.

305
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,204
Is this safe anymore?

306
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:14,239
We could've just filmed
this in a studio.

307
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,208
but no, we have to
be the real channel

308
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:17,376
that doesn't fake things.

309
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:18,677
We're gonna die!

310
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,362
We're getting just destroyed.
I'm getting hit.

311
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,449
There's a hole that is completely
opened up over my bed.

312
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:25,217
I can't do this.

313
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,409
- I can't do this.
- You can end this video, Jimmy.

314
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:28,420
Jimmy, please.

315
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,722
I tried to talk all you guys
out of it.

316
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,257
You all said yes!

317
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,203
This is the worst experience
I've ever had in my entire life.

318
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:38,063
I hate every part of this.

319
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,465
I'm just miserable right now.

320
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:46,145
The storm was reaching a new peak
with every passing hour.

321
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,101
We were desperate,
so we tried using our beds

322
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:52,948
as literal walls
to protect us from the rain.

323
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:54,946
We're all at rock bottom now.

324
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,515
It's been raining for a few hours.

325
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:58,083
It's freezing cold.

326
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,986
We don't have beds.
I'm getting nauseous.

327
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:03,055
I don't know if we're
going to make it

328
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:04,623
these full seven days at this point.

329
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:08,094
It rained nonstop
for around 20 hours straight.

330
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:10,043
and after

331
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:14,027
standing the whole night
completely soaked and exhausted,

332
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,502
we had to push ourselves to dry off
our supplies and rebuild camp.

333
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:18,937
Our raft is just in shambles.

334
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,572
Look at our beds,
we're drying them off.

335
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:22,307
This is harder than Antarctica.

336
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,996
This is harder than the desert video.

337
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,143
I'm just ready to be home.

338
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,678
I hate this raft.

339
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:28,156
I never want to see it again.

340
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:30,105
Our entire fire pit
is completely drenched.

341
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:33,031
We couldn't start a fire
if we wanted to tonight. No dinner.

342
00:12:33,074 --> 00:12:36,455
And to make matters worse, all of
our food was completely soaked.

343
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:39,325
Meaning only a portion
of it was still safe to eat.

344
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:43,095
We had stability,
we had food, we had dry beds,

345
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,270
and we took it for granted.

346
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:47,065
We can't take
another night like that.

347
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:48,533
We need to waterproof
the shelter.

348
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,801
We just ripped that off

349
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,803
to tide it here,
and then we'll leave it there.

350
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,238
But this time we have this.

351
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:54,806
Last night we were shivering cold.

352
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:55,941
and wanted to die.

353
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:58,076
So would you rather be
warm and dry or cold and wet?

354
00:12:58,343 --> 00:12:59,778
Put a zip tie here.

355
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:00,479
Nolan.

356
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:02,714
Tie a rope to that, zip tie there.

357
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:05,751
We can use that to push us up
so we get even more room.

358
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:09,421
I'm thinking, why don't I make
a really big clothesline and hang up

359
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:10,509
all our wet stuff?

360
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,525
Maybe we'll have dry towels
by tomorrow.

361
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,459
I want to die.

362
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,529
I'm sunburned, tired, dehydrated,
and did I say tired?

363
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,986
After fixing camp,
we were so exhausted

364
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,029
that we spent most
of the day sleeping.

365
00:13:22,072 --> 00:13:23,270
But at least when we woke up,

366
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:25,549
we were reunited
with a familiar friend.

367
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,039
- Bryan!
- Bryan! Bryan!

368
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,175
- Bryan!
- Bryan!

369
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:32,421
Bryan, come back!

370
00:13:32,554 --> 00:13:36,318
After being stuck in a raft
for five days with these guys.

371
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,850
This really is a nightmare.

372
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,085
I'll admit it,

373
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:41,692
- I missed Bryan.
- He's moved on.

374
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:45,347
You may not have given up on Bryan,
but Bryan gave up on you.

375
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,758
Bryan's given up on us.

376
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,027
We have two days left.
We're running out of food.

377
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,397
Our water is contaminated,
and we're all borderline dying.

378
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,441
I'm going crazy.

379
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,100
These last two days
will be interesting.

380
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,579
What could go wrong now?

381
00:13:57,622 --> 00:14:00,091
I can literally see 500
fish down there.

382
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,440
That is crazy.

383
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,942
Oh, my gosh.
This poop bucket stinks.

384
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:05,744
I almost had a mental breakdown
last night.

385
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:08,370
I was shivering wet the entire time.

386
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:09,247
Could not sleep.

387
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,116
It was one of the worst nights
of my life.

388
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,452
Last night,
shivering in the torrential rain

389
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:15,464
in the middle of the deep,
dark ocean.

390
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,621
You know, we got through it.

391
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,790
Now, the end of this challenge
could not come soon enough.

392
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,960
Making the challenge 7 days
was a horrible decision.

393
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,328
This is so much harder.

394
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:28,133
The new reinforced, waterproof
fortress actually worked.

395
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,301
Lannan said

396
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:30,826
it rained last night, did it?

397
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,137
At 4 a.m., sprinkled a little.

398
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,505
Hey, here's the beauty.

399
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:34,573
I didn't even know.

400
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:36,274
That was the best sleep
I've ever gotten.

401
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,910
I actually got a full night's
sleep last night.

402
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,879
I can barely even open my eyeballs.

403
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:43,639
I would say this is the hardest
challenge we've ever done,

404
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,918
adding the extra five days
on the end of a 50 hour challenge

405
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:47,953
definitely makes it harder.

406
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:49,545
The fact
that we're just drifting at sea

407
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,456
on this hunk of wood,
that's pretty impressive.

408
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,715
And while it seemed like
the rain was over,

409
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:56,161
we found ourselves
encountering a new obstacle.

410
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:59,064
We've gone from shivering cold
like two nights ago

411
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:01,933
to being scorching hot,
unbelievably hot.

412
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,126
I'm about to jump in the water
because I'm getting too hot.

413
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,237
We're going to go swimming.

414
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,571
I hope Nolan can swim.

415
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,552
And while they cooled off
in their own way,

416
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:09,674
we got creative with ours.

417
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:10,442
Oh, yes.

418
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:12,143
It's fans. Cold air.

419
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,278
I feel amazing.

420
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:14,079
Air!

421
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:15,550
A jellyfish bit me!

422
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:19,284
Why does the ocean hate us?

423
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,386
I knew it was a great idea
not to go swimming.

424
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:24,789
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my leg!

425
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:27,626
I found the sweet spot.

426
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,628
Yeah.

427
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:30,726
Oh, no.

428
00:15:30,768 --> 00:15:32,738
Yeah, I got a little welts
and some red lines.

429
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:34,983
For the majority of the day,
it was so hot

430
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,518
we literally
couldn't walk on the deck.

431
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:37,285
Yeah, I'm hot.

432
00:15:37,343 --> 00:15:39,545
I don't want to be alive.
I'm hot.

433
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:40,255
It's very hot.

434
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:42,808
But as the sun went down,
we were optimistic

435
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:44,006
about reaching the finish line.

436
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:46,428
We have less than 24 hours
left in the challenge.

437
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:47,863
This has genuinely been

438
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:50,465
the hardest challenge video
I've ever been a part of.

439
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:52,691
Honestly, this whole experience
has made me appreciate

440
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:54,469
all the things we take
for granted in life.

441
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,071
Like your shower, your food.

442
00:15:56,104 --> 00:15:58,106
I miss food.

443
00:15:58,407 --> 00:15:59,441
A working toilet.

444
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:01,419
I never want to poop
in a bucket again.

445
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:06,248
I say we celebrate making it
this far with a Feastable bar.

446
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:09,251
Yes, available in every Walmart,
Target, 7-Eleven, Albertson's

447
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:10,819
in America. It's 2023,

448
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,888
If you're still buying Hershey's,
it's kind of lame.

449
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:14,189
Hershey's for the boomers.

450
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,594
- Oh, Jimmy,
- How did you break the chair?

451
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:20,929
what is happening?

452
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:22,597
Jimmy, I'm starting to think
you ate all the food.

453
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,977
I guess I'll just continue
the time-lapse with a broken chair.

454
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:32,469
This is our final night
sleeping together, everybody.

455
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:34,743
Oh, I'm so glad to sleep alone.

456
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:36,411
I'm gonna miss
sleeping by your side.

457
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:39,514
100%. I would not rather
sleep next to any other man.

458
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:42,948
And with that, I'm going to bed.

459
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:54,981
After an amazing night's sleep,
we were visited by a familiar face.

460
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,744
Bryan brought his family to say
goodbye to us on the last day.

461
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:01,242
Thank you, Bryan.
That meant a lot.

462
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:03,271
It's almost like we were family
to Bryan.

463
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:04,072
We were.

464
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:07,445
He kept us safe during like,
the night we had the least shelter.

465
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,611
Maybe he's just a pea brain bird.

466
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:12,504
- Shut up.
- Nolan. Off the rack.

467
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:14,416
- I wish.
- That was emotional.

468
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,051
Everything's going full circle.

469
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:18,997
We had so many crazy memories
in this raft.

470
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,816
Yeah, and I think my best
memory is going to be leaving.

471
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:23,015
Same.

472
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:26,595
We spent over 150 hours
on this floating piece of wood.

473
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,588
And even though it was easily
the hardest thing I've ever done,

474
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,433
the boys and I still had
some good times.

475
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:33,602
- Where's this boat?
- Where's the boat?

476
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,436
The boat!

477
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:37,205
Then finally,
the end was literally in sight.

478
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,273
The boat, it's coming!

479
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:40,175
Alert the ship of our location.

480
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,710
Signaling the boat!

481
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:47,215
Boat! Boat! Boat!

482
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:49,551
Why is it moving so abnormally slow?

483
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:53,155
- Oh, my God!
- I'm getting off this raft.

484
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:55,285
