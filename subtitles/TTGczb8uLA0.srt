1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,102
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,981
20th July 1969,

3
00:00:02,981 --> 00:00:06,616
The Lunar Module of the Apollo 11 mission landed on the moon.

4
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:10,715
Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were in it.

5
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:14,527
After the landing, Neil Armstrong tried to open the door,

6
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:16,029
to get down on the moon.

7
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:18,005
It wasn't easy opening this door,

8
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:19,277
due to high pressure,

9
00:00:19,277 --> 00:00:22,275
but he successfully opened it after a little struggle.

10
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:27,505
Then he tried to get down to the moon in his heavy spacesuit.

11
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:29,785
The exit wasn't spacious

12
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:34,730
so by mistake, he hit the top, and a piece of the Lunar Module broke off.

13
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:36,995
Neither of them was aware of this

14
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,673
because of the lack of air.

15
00:00:38,673 --> 00:00:40,910
The sound didn't travel.

16
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,511
They didn't hear any sound.

17
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:45,951
But this broken piece was very crucial.

18
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:48,567
It was the Assent Engine Arming Switch.

19
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:52,855
Without this switch, their Lunar Module couldn't take off again,

20
00:00:52,855 --> 00:00:55,440
and they couldn't return to Earth.

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,483
Unaware of this, Neil Armstrong got out

22
00:00:58,483 --> 00:01:00,439
and stepped on the moon's surface.

23
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:04,081
He became the first man to step on the moon.

24
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:06,464
"One small step for man,

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,344
one giant leap for mankind."

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,214
But did it actually happen?

27
00:01:15,214 --> 00:01:18,032
Today, more than 50 years later,

28
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:22,374
many people refuse to believe that humans had gone to the moon.

29
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,098
People cook up theories of their own

30
00:01:25,098 --> 00:01:30,106
to claim that the entire Apollo 11 mission was a farce put up by America.

31
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:32,698
That they filmed the scenes on Earth,

32
00:01:32,698 --> 00:01:34,174
and lied to the world.

33
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:37,365
How else do you explain the flag fluttering without air?

34
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:39,062
What's the truth to it?

35
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:41,456
Come let's try to understand this story

36
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:42,918
in today's video.

37
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:46,365
"3...2...1...0!

38
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:48,284
All engines running."

39
00:01:48,284 --> 00:01:52,512
"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do other things,

40
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:56,235
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard."

41
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:01,031
Tranquillity Base here,

42
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:02,687
The Eagle has landed!

43
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:04,958
One small step for man,

44
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,661
one giant leap for mankind."

45
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,387
Friends, you'd be surprised to know,

46
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:13,633
the real reason why Apollo 11 mission was planned

47
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,973
was a war.

48
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:17,297
Specifically speaking, the Cold War.

49
00:02:17,297 --> 00:02:20,079
Fought between America and the Soviet Union.

50
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:27,222
Both countries were engaged in a Space Race.

51
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:30,535
In 1957, the Soviet Union became the first country

52
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:33,472
to launch the first artificial satellite.

53
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:36,709
It was named Sputnik, 
and it was the first manmade object

54
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,595
to be placed in Earth's orbit.

55
00:02:38,595 --> 00:02:42,433
The American government was shocked to see the Soviets getting ahead.

56
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:46,145
Months later, in 1958, America launched their satellite as well.

57
00:02:46,145 --> 00:02:48,303
But 3 years later, in 1961,

58
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:50,330
America got another shock.

59
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,912
Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin,

60
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:55,494
was the first person to go to space.

61
00:02:55,494 --> 00:02:58,328
The Soviets beat America once again.

62
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:01,803
One week later, the then President of America,

63
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:02,895
John F. Kennedy,

64
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:05,139
wrote a letter to the Vice President

65
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,240
dated 20th April 1961.

66
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,579
He asked the Vice President how they could beat the Soviet Union.

67
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:12,604
"...by putting a laboratory in space,

68
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:14,050
or by a trip around the moon,..."

69
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,033
"Are we working 24 hours a day on existing programs?

70
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:18,344
If not, why not?"

71
00:03:18,344 --> 00:03:20,387
"Are we making the maximum effort?"

72
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:23,385
Asking if there was another space program that could be achieved quickly

73
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:28,081
that would produce dramatic results and give them a lead in the race.

74
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:30,146
He got the answer some days later

75
00:03:30,146 --> 00:03:32,187
because he soon realised that

76
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:35,341
the next big step would be to send humans to the moon.

77
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,561
On 25th May 1961,

78
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:41,052
in his famous speech, he promised the world

79
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:45,029
that he would send humans to the moon before the end of the decade.

80
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:47,607
Not only this, he also promised to 

81
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:50,129
get the humans back on Earth safely.

82
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,757
"Before this decade is out,

83
00:03:51,757 --> 00:03:53,830
of landing a man on the moon,

84
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,651
and returning him safely to the Earth."

85
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,723
For many, this was an unbelievable announcement. 

86
00:03:58,723 --> 00:04:01,132
Friends, imagine 1961,

87
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:03,497
There were no smartphones, no internet,

88
00:04:03,497 --> 00:04:05,472
there wasn't even GPS technology.

89
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:07,377
The computers were so slow and old,

90
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:09,678
in such times, he was promising 

91
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:11,485
to send humans to the moon.

92
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,312
For this, over the next 5 years,

93
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:17,367
he provided $7-$9 billion, in additional funding to the space program.

94
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:21,341
The entire space agency was engaged in fulfilling this one aim.

95
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:24,260
Mere months later, the tests began.

96
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,543
First, they tested the rockets

97
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:29,750
that would be used to leave the Earth.

98
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,116
Then the heat shields of the command modules were tested.

99
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,953
How much they'd be able to resist heat.

100
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:37,188
Then the propulsion system of the service module.

101
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:39,858
Between 1963 to 1967,

102
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:43,129
many unmanned tests were carried out.

103
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:45,561
The rockets didn't carry any humans

104
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:46,977
during the tests.

105
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:48,833
In February 1967,

106
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,443
the planned the first manned tests.

107
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:56,014
A test in which astronauts will go up to space in the rockets.

108
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:58,374
This was the Apollo 1 mission.

109
00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:00,959
But during the tests on Earth,

110
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,217
on 27th January 1967,

111
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:05,215
the cabin caught on fire,

112
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:08,597
and the three astronauts preparing to go to space,

113
00:05:08,597 --> 00:05:10,368
died in the fire.

114
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:13,331
After this painful event, NASA didn't lose courage.

115
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:15,627
Instead, it continued further testing.

116
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:18,219
Apollo 4, Apollo 5, and Apollo 6,

117
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:20,211
were all unmanned missions.

118
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:21,703
for further testing.

119
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:25,067
In October 1968, Apollo 7 mission was launched

120
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,239
and once again they attempted to

121
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,625
send humans to space.

122
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,195
This was successful.

123
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:33,696
Only 2 months later, in December 1968,

124
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:35,899
Apollo 8 mission was launched

125
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:39,389
in which three astronauts were sent near the moon.

126
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,894
Three months later, in March 1969,

127
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:43,807
Apollo 9 mission was launched.

128
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,099
In this, the lunar module was tested.

129
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:49,059
The part of the spacecraft that was actually going to land on the moon.

130
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:51,616
And 2 months after that, in May 1969,

131
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:52,723
was the Apollo 10 mission.

132
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:54,709
In this mission, 3 astronauts

133
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:57,652
had to do almost everything for practice

134
00:05:57,652 --> 00:06:00,019
that was supposed to be done in Apollo 11 mission,

135
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,685
except actually landing on the moon.

136
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:03,985
Look at the speed with which NASA

137
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:06,193
was launching the missions one after the other.

138
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:08,034
In the gap of 2 to 3 months,

139
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,788
a new mission to test the next thing.

140
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,973
Testing the rockets, spacecraft,

141
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,632
going to the moon,

142
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:16,121
and after all these tests,

143
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:19,452
finally, on 16th July 1969,

144
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:21,594
Apollo 11 mission was launched.

145
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:24,664
"...2...1....0!

146
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:25,985
All engine running.

147
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,441
Liftoff, we have a liftoff.

148
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:30,691
32 minutes past the hour.

149
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,226
Liftoff of Apollo 11."

150
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,600
Three astronauts were a part of this mission.

151
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,559
38-year-old commander Neil Armstrong,

152
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,174
he led this mission.

153
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:43,792
The pilot of the Command Module,
Michael Collins,

154
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:47,244
And the pilot of the Lunar Module,
Edwin Buzz Aldrin.

155
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:49,702
These three names are inscribed in the pages of history.

156
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:52,675
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin become famous names

157
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,150
everyone knows them today.

158
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,765
But Michael Collins isn't very popular

159
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:59,924
the reason for this is very interesting,
I'll tell you later in this video.

160
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:02,574
The spacecraft of this Apollo 11 mission,

161
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:04,363
had three main parts.

162
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:07,597
The Command Module, Service Module, and the Lunar Module.

163
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:10,509
The first two are collectively known as CSM.

164
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:12,376
Command and Service Module.

165
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:18,188
They aimed to detach the Lunar Module and have it land on the moon.

166
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,863
And to return, the Lunar Module would have to be

167
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:23,127
relaunched and attached to the CSM,

168
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:25,292
to enable the astronauts to return to Earth.

169
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:29,780
To launch this spacecraft, a Saturn V-5 rocket was to be used.

170
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,398
Before the launch, the rocket was loaded with

171
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:35,460
1 million gallon of Kerosene, Liquid Oxygen, and Liquid Hydrogen.

172
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,242
The weight of this rocket was 3 million kg.

173
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:43,093
With its help, the spacecraft reached Earth's orbit.

174
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:45,772
It took less than 10 minutes to reach the orbit.

175
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:49,044
Then they made about 1.5 revolutions around the Earth,

176
00:07:49,044 --> 00:07:51,407
after which they were given the permission from the mission control,

177
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:53,481
the mission control was of course based on Earth,

178
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:57,667
they communicated their permission to begin Trans-Lunar Injection.

179
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:02,896
i.e., taking the spacecraft out of Earth's orbit and towards Moon's orbit.

180
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:07,005
To leave Earth's orbit, the Saturn V-5 rocket was used.

181
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:08,650
This was the third stage for the rocket.

182
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,348
These events took place within 5 hours of the launch.

183
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:15,129
But to actually reach the moon, took several days.

184
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,590
Astronauts waited in the spacecraft

185
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,565
the ate, slept, and took pictures of themselves and their surroundings,

186
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,762
19th July 1969,

187
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:25,446
After travelling for almost 400,000 km,

188
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:29,402
The Apollo 11 spacecraft reached moon's orbit.

189
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:32,068
Here, it was supposed to be split into 2.

190
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:36,068
The Command and Service Module separated from the Lunar Module.

191
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:38,264
Michael Collins was in the Command Module,

192
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:41,741
This part of the spacecraft was nicknamed Columbia.

193
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:44,453
And the Lunar Module was nicknamed the Eagle.

194
00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:47,424
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were in it.

195
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:50,078
The thing is that, the command and service module,

196
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:52,756
was tasked to remain in the moon's orbit.

197
00:08:52,756 --> 00:08:56,916
Only the lunar module was going to land on the moon.

198
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:01,836
It meant that only Armstrong and Aldrin had the chance to step on the moon,

199
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:03,486
and not Michael Collins.

200
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:06,680
Perhaps, this is the reason why not many people know Michael Collins.

201
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,495
Even though he was a part of the Apollo mission,

202
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:11,586
he did not step on the moon.

203
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:14,808
But even so, Michael Collins' part in this mission

204
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:16,514
was perhaps the most important.

205
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:20,300
Because the Lunar Module was supposed to be reattached to the CSM.

206
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,104
Without Michael Collins,

207
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:25,229
Armstrong and Aldrin could not have returned safely.

208
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:28,692
Around 8 PM, the Lunar Module was going to land on the moon.

209
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:30,590
Exactly at 8:10 PM,

210
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,396
alarms went off.

211
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:33,976
1201 and 1202 alarms.

212
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:35,629
"-1201.
-1201.

213
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:37,629
-Roger, 1201 alarm."

214
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:40,611
Neither Armstrong nor Aldrin knew

215
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:42,101
the meaning of this alarm.

216
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:45,679
They asked the mission control what they ought to do next.

217
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,344
Mission control tells them to ignore it and keep going.

218
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,953
"We're GO, Same type, We're GO."

219
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:54,188
Later, they figured out that 1202 was a warning.

220
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:58,554
The processing system of the guidance computer of the Apollo was overloaded.

221
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:01,306
But thankfully, the computer was designed in a way that

222
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:04,925
the essential programs which were critical for the mission,

223
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:06,907
would continue despite being overloaded.

224
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,623
The computer was installed with the program for automatic landing.

225
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:13,135
This would automatically land the Lunar Module on Moon's surface.

226
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:15,610
But at the height of 150 metres,

227
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,025
Neil Armstrong took over the control.

228
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:22,678
He noticed that the Lunar Module was going to land at a place where

229
00:10:22,678 --> 00:10:24,354
huge boulders were strewn about.

230
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:25,938
The landing spot was changed then.

231
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:29,032
And they decided on another spot 4 miles from the predetermined landing spot,

232
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:30,116
for the actual landing.

233
00:10:30,116 --> 00:10:31,846
At 8:16 PM,

234
00:10:31,846 --> 00:10:34,298
Buzz Aldrin checked the fuel indicator.

235
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:36,453
Only 5% fuel remained.

236
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:38,326
"100 feet, 3-1/2 down, 9 forward,

237
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,046
5 per cent...

238
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:42,217
Okay."

239
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:46,163
Seeing the low level of fuel, the mission control initiated a countdown.

240
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:50,580
The countdown to decide whether they should land or abort the mission.

241
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,170
"Now we're at critical fuel state.

242
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,470
And that's why the 60-second call is given.

243
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,366
And then the 30-second call."

244
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,493
Finally, literally at the last minute,

245
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,476
with only 30 seconds remaining in this countdown,

246
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:06,545
Neil Armstrong sent a radio message to Earth.

247
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,521
"Roger, Tranquility." 

248
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:18,107
The Eagle had successfully landed.

249
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:21,698
Then Neil Armstrong put on his spacesuit, opened the door,

250
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:24,158
and stepped on the moon.

251
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:32,213
This moment was watched by 650 million people on television.

252
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:34,752
His first words were televised to the world

253
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,567
Buzz Aldrin followed him on the moon's surface,

254
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:47,414
and for the next 2.5 hours,

255
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:50,496
they collected samples of the moon's dust and rocks,

256
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:51,662
took photographs,

257
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:53,877
set up several scientific instruments as well.

258
00:11:53,877 --> 00:11:59,028
Although it is true that the Cold War was a big reason for this moon landing,

259
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:01,184
but because the moon landing was already planned,

260
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:03,005
it was such a huge achievement so obviously

261
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:05,467
they were carrying scientific instruments with them.

262
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:08,132
There were several scientific objectives of this mission as well.

263
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:10,965
They set up a television camera on the moon,

264
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:13,012
to transmit signals to the Earth.

265
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:17,909
They took a device with them to measure the solar winds reaching the moon.

266
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:22,238
They installed a device to send laser beams to the Earth,

267
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:24,165
So that the laser beams could be used

268
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:27,024
to compute the exact distance between Earth and Moon.

269
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:29,288
They also had a passive seismometer.

270
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:31,996
To measure the earthquakes on the moon.

271
00:12:31,996 --> 00:12:34,576
Of course, they're called Moonquakes.

272
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:39,311
They collected 23 kg of rock and dust from the moon.

273
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:42,774
And they left behind an American flag.

274
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:44,617
And a plate with the inscription

275
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,415
"Here, Men from the Planet Earth,

276
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:48,760
First set foot upon the Moon.

277
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,024
July 1969 A.D.

278
00:12:53,027 --> 00:12:56,128
The Lunar Module had to remain on the moon for 21 hours.

279
00:12:56,128 --> 00:12:58,106
After this, it had to take off once again,

280
00:12:58,106 --> 00:13:00,275
and attach to the CSM.

281
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:03,523
But to go up, they needed propulsion.

282
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:04,680
And for that, they needed an engine.

283
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,136
Both Armstrong and Aldrin were unaware that

284
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:10,470
the switch to turn on the engine,

285
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,840
had broken off while they were getting out.

286
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,161
I told you this at the beginning of the video.

287
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:18,574
When they came back to the Lunar Module,

288
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:21,088
they realised what had happened.

289
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:23,473
They informed the mission control about this damage,

290
00:13:23,473 --> 00:13:26,882
and look for a solution to resolve the situation.

291
00:13:26,882 --> 00:13:30,057
They come up with an interesting solution to the problem.

292
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:31,517
Now, what exactly is a switch?

293
00:13:31,517 --> 00:13:34,859
Switch basically works to complete an electrical circuit.

294
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:38,131
Buzz Aldrin realised that if the circuit is broken,

295
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:40,760
They looked for something that could be used

296
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,333
to complete the circuit once again.

297
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:46,196
When he looked around, he noticed his ballpoint pen.

298
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:49,777
He used that ballpoint pen to complete the circuit

299
00:13:49,777 --> 00:13:52,390
and to reignite the engine.

300
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,949
Finally, the Lunar Module was reattached to the CSM,

301
00:13:55,949 --> 00:14:00,693
and the three astronauts turn the spacecraft towards Earth.

302
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:02,910
The plan for landing on Earth was that

303
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,866
The Command Module and the Service Module would be separated,

304
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:09,352
The service module would then be destroyed due to Earth's atmosphere,

305
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:12,911
But there was a danger that if the service module was damaged severely,

306
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:14,865
with its debris floating all around,

307
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:16,994
they may hit the command module,

308
00:14:16,994 --> 00:14:19,034
killing the astronauts on board.

309
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:23,541
To avoid this, NASA installed thrusters in the Service Module.

310
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,947
To take it far from the Command Module,

311
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:27,632
So that they do not collide with each other.

312
00:14:27,632 --> 00:14:30,476
But when the astronauts were returning to Earth,

313
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:34,144
they found out that the thrusters on the Service Module weren't working.

314
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:36,780
The three astronauts could only sit in the Command Module

315
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,849
and watch the service module break apart around them.

316
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:41,998
Its debris was floating all around them.

317
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:45,674
It was a miracle that the broken pieces,

318
00:14:45,674 --> 00:14:48,115
did not hit the command module.

319
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:50,112
And the command module remains safe.

320
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:53,203
The risk of the astronauts dying on this mission was so high that

321
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:57,292
the US President Nixon had prepared an alternate speech,

322
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,143
in case the astronauts were indeed killed.

323
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:02,249
Can you imagine an alternate speech?

324
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:03,590
In it, he had written,

325
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,424
"Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon, to explore in peace,

326
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:09,229
will stay on the moon to rest in peace.

327
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:12,290
These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin,

328
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,445
know that there is no hope for their recovery.

329
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:16,463
These two men are laying down their lives

330
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:18,828
in mankind's most noble goal.

331
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:21,103
The search for truth and understanding."

332
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:22,799
But thankfully, this wasn't needed.

333
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,162
The Command Module safely descended the Earth's atmosphere.

334
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:29,504
The parachutes were deployed, and it landed in the ocean.

335
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,840
All three astronauts were alive and safe.

336
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,943
These astronauts were then evacuated by rescue ships from the ocean.

337
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:40,715
It was truly a miracle that they could return alive.

338
00:15:40,715 --> 00:15:44,742
It wasn't that the mission had gone exactly as it was planned,

339
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:47,812
They had to face problems at almost every step.

340
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:50,233
They successfully dealt with the problems,

341
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:52,203
and they could return alive.

342
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:53,971
It is interesting to note that

343
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:58,078
after returning, the three astronauts were quarantined for 2 weeks.

344
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:00,340
They weren't allowed to be in contact with other humans.

345
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,733
Because of the risk of them carrying pathogens.

346
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:06,100
Viruses or bacteria that they might have encountered on moon,

347
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,774
that could possibly wreck havoc on Earth.

348
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:10,858
No one knew for sure.

349
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:13,296
But again, thankfully, nothing of the sort happened.

350
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:16,538
Apollo 11's moon landing was the top news in newspapers worldwide.

351
00:16:16,538 --> 00:16:18,983
The US President Kennedy's promise

352
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:23,456
of having humans land on the moon before the end of the decade,

353
00:16:23,456 --> 00:16:25,391
was made possible by NASA.

354
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:31,118
"In 1969, the public had little reason to question

355
00:16:31,118 --> 00:16:33,514
mankind's historic first step on the moon.

356
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:36,800
After all, the achievement was a celebration of

357
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,735
technological supremacy.

358
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,240
America had finally won the Space Race."

359
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:44,879
Isn't it very suspicious

360
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,561
that the decade that was about to end in 1970,

361
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:53,239
a year before that, in 1969, America had reached the moon?

362
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:56,918
It can't be that to have an advantage in the Cold War,

363
00:16:56,918 --> 00:17:01,154
America planned a fake moon landing operation, can it?

364
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:04,071
That their actual moon landing mission failed,

365
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:07,537
and they planned this fake mission as backup,

366
00:17:07,537 --> 00:17:08,549
for the world to see.

367
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:11,779
Friends, this is just one example of the many conspiracy theories

368
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:15,010
that is based on the moon landing.

369
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,925
But friends, the truth is that these conspiracy theories

370
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:20,284
have already been debunked several times.

371
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:24,893
If this was a fake attempt by America to fool the world,

372
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:27,011
the Soviets would never have acknowledged it.

373
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:32,245
But in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, published between 1970-1979,

374
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:33,532
in its Third Edition,

375
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:37,156
this moon landing was said to be factual multiple times.

376
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,545
Soviet articles have even been written

377
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:43,347
that the Apollo landing was the third historic event of the space age.

378
00:17:43,347 --> 00:17:46,280
First was Sputnik's launch in 1957,

379
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,503
Second, Yuri Gagarin's flight in 1961,

380
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,173
And the third was the moon landing.

381
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:54,036
The Soviet Union had actually acknowledged this.

382
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:55,813
But then, what about the flag?

383
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:57,944
The flag which was planted on the moon,

384
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,347
why was it fluttering?

385
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:00,901
There is no air on the moon.

386
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:02,716
There is a simple reason for that, friends.

387
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:06,420
The flag that Armstrong and Aldrin had taken to the moon,

388
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,237
was a specially designed flag.

389
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:11,929
Normal flags have one long vertical rod.

390
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:14,923
But there was a horizontal rod in this too.

391
00:18:14,923 --> 00:18:16,350
Right at the top of the flag,

392
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,632
So that the flag would always be extended out.

393
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:20,956
Because everyone working at NASA knew that

394
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:23,014
if a flag is planted on the moon,

395
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:25,263
it wouldn't flutter due to the lack of wind,

396
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:27,479
So they decided to add a horizontal rod at the top,

397
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:29,296
so that the flag could always be properly visible.

398
00:18:29,296 --> 00:18:30,996
But on this Apollo 11 mission,

399
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:35,044
there were some problems extending this horizontal rod,

400
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:37,363
So this couldn't be extended till the end.

401
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:39,518
Which caused the ripple that we see.

402
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,999
There were 'waves' in the flag.

403
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:43,827
That's why people think that the flag is fluttering.

404
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:46,061
But actually, the flag isn't fluttering,

405
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:48,471
You can see the flag 'fluttering' only in the videos where

406
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:50,843
the astronauts are holding it and making it move.

407
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:52,273
The reason for this is that

408
00:18:52,273 --> 00:18:54,285
the aluminium rods in the flag,

409
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:55,831
were acting as springs.

410
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:59,371
So the flag would move for a little while and then remain still.

411
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,444
The third most popular theory is that

412
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:05,400
in the photos taken by Armstrong and Aldrin,

413
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,525
stars aren't visible.

414
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:09,299
The answer to this is very simple.

415
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,058
The moon landing took place in the day.

416
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:15,999
At a time when the sunlight was hitting the moon.

417
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:18,640
And the white spacesuits that were worn by the astronauts,

418
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,942
were very reflective too.

419
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:24,093
The cameras back then didn't have such resolution to see beyond reflections.

420
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:26,621
Even today, take any phone's camera,

421
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:30,281
and try to take a pic at night,

422
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:31,878
if the flash is turned on,

423
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:34,134
you won't see the stars in the background.

424
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:36,785
Another theory is about the shadows,

425
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:38,706
About the inconsistency in the angles of the shadows.

426
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:42,330
People argue that since this was like a Hollywood film,

427
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,151
They didn't have just a single source of light.

428
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:46,182
That's why the shadows are going all over the place.

429
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:49,971
But in reality, the Sun was not the only source of light.

430
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:54,571
The moon's surface was also acting as a complementary source of light,

431
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:56,775
because it was reflecting so much light.

432
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:59,903
This is why the light scattered in all directions,

433
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:01,697
and the shadows were so bizarre.

434
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:05,790
Another question is raised about Buzz Aldrin's photo taken by Neil Armstrong,

435
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,238
It shows Armstrong's reflection

436
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:10,355
but you can see a camera in his hand.

437
00:20:10,355 --> 00:20:11,888
How could this happen?

438
00:20:12,322 --> 00:20:15,319
It's because he wasn't holding the camera in his hand,

439
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:17,591
instead, the camera was mounted on his suit.

440
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,517
And he could control it from there.

441
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:24,337
But then who took the photos of Neil Armstrong descending from the Lunar Module?

442
00:20:24,337 --> 00:20:25,903
Again, a simple answer

443
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:28,540
multiple cameras were installed on the Lunar Module.

444
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,730
But moving beyond these mindless theories,

445
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,910
if we talk about actual criticism,

446
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:37,000
Friends, not everyone was applauding the moon landing,

447
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,693
commending NASA's work,

448
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:41,729
many people strongly criticised NASA

449
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:44,270
and the American government after the moon landing.

450
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:48,229
People were already criticising it before the moon landing.

451
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:52,073
In January 1962, the New York Times published an article

452
00:20:52,073 --> 00:20:56,605
in which they revealed that the money being spent to go on the moon,

453
00:20:56,605 --> 00:21:01,610
could have been used to build at least 120 Harvard-sized universities.

454
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,912
They questioned whether so much money should be spent to go to the moon,

455
00:21:04,912 --> 00:21:08,628
or should they open a Harvard-sized university in every US state?

456
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:09,874
Weren't there better ways to spend that money?

457
00:21:09,874 --> 00:21:11,927
Basically, the main point of criticism was that

458
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:14,662
there were so many problems in the country,

459
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:16,861
education, income inequality,

460
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:19,891
back then America was also facing the consequences of the Vietnam War.

461
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:22,372
So why was so much money wasted on this?

462
00:21:22,372 --> 00:21:25,825
But in reality, there were many hidden benefits of the moon landing,

463
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:27,736
that no one had even thought about.

464
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:30,063
Such as the advancements in computer chips.

465
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:33,438
In 1962, it had been 3 years since microchips were invented.

466
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:36,510
And IBM had decided that in the early 1960s,

467
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,822
they wouldn't use these chips in their computers.

468
00:21:38,822 --> 00:21:40,545
"It has the packaged integrated circuit.

469
00:21:40,545 --> 00:21:42,928
Inside this package, is a chip of silicon,

470
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:44,752
which provides the electrical equivalent

471
00:21:44,752 --> 00:21:47,271
of many transistors, resistors, and diodes,

472
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:49,654
all interconnected to provide the desired function."

473
00:21:49,654 --> 00:21:53,869
But since NASA put in so many orders to buy integrated circuits

474
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:56,357
IBM started working on it,

475
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,835
and because of the heavy demand,

476
00:21:57,835 --> 00:22:01,302
its price fell by more than 90% over the next 5 years.

477
00:22:01,302 --> 00:22:05,251
And so NASA tested whether we can rely on computers

478
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:07,148
for the safety of human lives.

479
00:22:07,148 --> 00:22:09,081
If astronauts could go to the moon and back,

480
00:22:09,081 --> 00:22:10,990
by relying on these computer chips,

481
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,687
we can obviously rely on these computer chips for our daily lives.

482
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:19,565
The technology grew exponentially after this moon landing.

483
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:22,536
Even so, only 3 years after the Apollo 11 mission,

484
00:22:22,536 --> 00:22:24,661
in December 1972,

485
00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:28,580
the last moon mission, Apollo 17 took place.

486
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,344
Since then friends,

487
00:22:30,344 --> 00:22:32,325
It has been almost 50 years,

488
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:36,260
no other person went to the moon during these 50 years.

489
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,612
Perhaps this is the biggest proof

490
00:22:38,612 --> 00:22:40,834
about how expensive the Apollo program was.

491
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:44,280
More than 400,000 engineers, scientists, and technicians, had worked on it.

492
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,229
and the total cost back then was $24 billion.

493
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:51,222
In today's money, the cost is more than $100 billion.

494
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:53,675
Initially, it was criticised by journalists only.

495
00:22:53,675 --> 00:22:55,834
But by 1972,

496
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,756
the average person's fascination with NASA

497
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:00,447
and the moon had ended.

498
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:02,796
As the Vietnam War continued,

499
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:05,264
the problems of the citizens were on the rise,

500
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:08,280
"Thousands of demonstrators
opposed to the Vietnam War

501
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,082
assemble in the nation's capital
for a mass protest."

502
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,480
They saw the space program as a waste of money.

503
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,133
Even though NASA had plans for missions up to Apollo 20,

504
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:21,747
politicians had to heed the citizens,

505
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:24,539
and the money being spent on space programs,

506
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,308
had to be cut down.

507
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:29,676
In December 2017, former President Donald Trump said that

508
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,096
he would increase the funding

509
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:34,734
so that humans could be sent back to the moon by 2024.

510
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:37,780
"...returning American astronauts to the moon,

511
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,300
for the first time since 1972,

512
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,860
for long-term exploration and use this time."

513
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:45,776
But later he changed his statement and said that

514
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:48,687
NASA should focus on Mars rather than on the moon.

515
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:53,143
But 50 years later, now NASA has made plans again,

516
00:23:53,143 --> 00:23:55,074
to send people to the moon.

517
00:23:55,074 --> 00:23:57,156
Their new Artemis program.

518
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:59,838
They would begin testing with unmanned rockets,

519
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,487
but NASA plans that by 2025-2026,

520
00:24:02,487 --> 00:24:04,418
they would send the first woman to the moon.

521
00:24:04,418 --> 00:24:08,669
After which, they plan to send the first person of colour to the moon as well.

522
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:11,073
One thing can be said for sure,

523
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:13,506
Before the end of this decade,

524
00:24:13,506 --> 00:24:16,533
we will see humans back on the moon.

525
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:19,865
