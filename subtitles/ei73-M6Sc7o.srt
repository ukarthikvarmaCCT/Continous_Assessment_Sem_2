He couldn't have taken Gauri
too far from here.

Thank you very much.

193

I just came to offer prayers
at the Lord Sheshnag temple.

A new story is about to begin.

197

I will ask God
to help you find your wife.

Thank you and let me know
if I can be of help.

I think Gauri is in there.

Don't you dare come in!

I will surely remain alive all right.
