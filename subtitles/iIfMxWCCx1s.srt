Friends, here a boy has come for a walk in the forest, then he

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,820
sees a poisonous plant in the jungle, then here he starts eating it, then there is a poisonous plant, this boy

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,139
has got his hand and cat's litter due to which he gets infection in his hand, now doctor how to cure it?

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,760
I will fix it, I will understand with the help of animation video but before that, if you

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,980
are cute then give this video a like and subscribe the channel and if you are an ass then don't do it

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,140
and if you want to write then definitely write Jai Shri Ram in the comment box friends first. So the doctor

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,640
injects NSIC in the hand and then

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,020
cleans the hand thoroughly with iodine liquid. Then an incision is made in the hand with a knife and the pus

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,820
is taken out in such a way as you can see. And then the pus

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,379
is cleaned thoroughly with a cloth, then the poisonous plant

11
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,760
is taken out from inside the hand in this way, then a tank is placed on the hand and the hand is bandaged

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,280
so that the person can get some relief. both are fine
