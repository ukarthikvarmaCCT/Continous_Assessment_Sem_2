00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,000
it's really cool i grew up somewhere really really 
small i grew up in a super like super tiny town  

41
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,720
and then i moved to madrid which is the capital of 
spain and it is like a huge city by comparison and  

42
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,840
so it's been really amazing for me i feel like 
there's like so much to do and so much to see  

43
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:07,440
all the time um so i really like living here and 
here i work as an english it's i work as like a  

44
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,560
language assistant um teaching english and i work 
with like really really really young children  

45
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,240
so i work with four-year-olds and 
i don't like colors and letters and

46
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,520
how to write their names um all of that 
different stuff and then i'm studying  

47
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,560
my master's degree here as well 
so busy busy busy yeah i like um  

48
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,520
are an inspiration to me because i also 
live in a really really small town and yes  

49
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,920
i have to go to a huge city after you know 
i graduate maybe or i have to move to some  

50
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,960
huge city afterwards so yes i'm also a little bit 
scared about what is going to happen over there

51
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,960
yeah well i was so scared about moving here 
because i had never visited spain before

52
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,600
but it's been fun it's it's a good 
experience to like be away from my  

53
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:18,480
family and like have to be independent and so 
if you're thinking about like studying abroad  

54
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,040
or just like going and traveling for a 
little while um i would definitely recommend  

55
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:35,040
do you know so i know that you said that you're 
only uh in eighth grade but um do you have idea  

56
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,600
what you might want to do when you're older um 
well not really i say um i would go in the path  

57
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,640
of science because i really really love science 
um but after that i don't know what i'm going to  

58
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,480
become whether in the research line or medical 
line or i have i will think that in the future  

59
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,560
oh yes you have a lot of time you have a lot of 
time but you said that you like science so do  

60
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:08,800
you like like biology or like chemistry um biology 
biology is my favorite subject ever that's so fun  

61
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:17,120
i am horrible at science so i really respect 
that because whenever i'm trying to think about  

62
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:25,520
how old i was when i had to take biology for the 
first time i think i was 15 and i've always been  

63
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,520
like really good with the rest of my classes and 
i remember i think i made like a c in my biology  

64
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,720
class or something and i was so upset about it 
because i i just like could not my brain could not  

65
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,880
understand some of the stuff that i was learning 
um now i think it's like a little bit more  

66
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,480
interesting um my like partner he works in the 
sciences and he'll like explain things to me some  

67
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,200
yeah well you know if you have 
a little interest in it then

68
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,320
yes yes right totally

69
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:23,200
yes i can hear you i cannot hear you can you 
hear me oh no i can hear you yes what about now

70
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,720
hello hear me

71
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:35,920
oh no yes yes can you hear me now 
okay okay yes yes okay it's fine now

72
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,680
what were you saying just like being 
interested in it do you feel like it  

73
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,760
makes it easier for you to like learn 
some of the stuff because you like it  

74
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,120
yes yes of course because you know when 
you're interested in a subject you automa  

75
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,360
automatically get addicted to it and yes it 
works because like uh that's me in history  

76
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,640
that you said you are in biology because like 
in history like i don't understand that even  

77
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,640
a little bit of it what is happening so well 
yeah you know sometimes i do get a little bit  

78
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,400
of interest and i love to read it but most of 
the time it is like just memorizing the stuffs  

79
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,600
yes history is also really hard for me because of 
the like memorization for us like we would have to  

80
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:30,960
memorize all sorts of like years and oops dates 
that stuff happened and i okay i could not tell  

81
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:38,800
you now anything that i learned like in history 
class um but that's cool that's cool that you at  

82
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,360
least like have an idea and you know what you like 
and that kind of thing um because i think whenever  

83
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,600
i was in school like when i was your age i had no 
idea what i wanted to do when i was older so if  

84
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,440
you have an idea it like helps kind of guide your 
path um and you were saying you wanted to move  

85
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,960
have you thought about like studying abroad um can 
you do that in like high school there um no not  

86
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:11,440
really i have not really thought about it right 
now um i would see where my destiny takes me but  

87
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,880
um well let's see what happens because you know 
if i get some you know there are some scholarships  

88
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,200
and all that so if i get that maybe i will move 
there but maybe after graduation just not afraid

89
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:32,320
i understand and do you think um what was i gonna 
ask oh have you ever traveled outside of india  

90
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,480
yes yes a lot of places like um china and then 
europe i have traveled a lot of places in europe  

91
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:52,640
then dubai maldives um then bali singapore yes is 
awesome that's so fun you traveled to many more  

92
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,200
places than i have have you ever visited the us no 
i haven't but i'm eagerly looking forward to visit  

93
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,120
it because you know i've heard a lot about it and 
i also know a lot geography about it so where are  

94
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,880
these popular places and all those so yes i am 
really looking forward to visit it someday yes  

95
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:20,640
yes no have you ever um visited spain too have 
you ever visited spain at all no i haven't oh  

96
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,640
it's okay it's okay spain's a really cool place to 
visit um i think even after i move away from here  

97
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:33,120
i'll probably come back and visit like just like 
a tourist because it's a super super cool country  

98
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,120
um that's really cool that you've been to all 
of those places and i think that like the next

99
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,920
i'm a teacher i don't think i'm ever gonna 
get rich but whenever i save up some money  

100
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:53,760
i would really like to travel to asia um because 
i are like southeast asia because i talk to so  

101
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:01,120
many people all the time from like japan vietnam 
like thailand all these different places and for  

102
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,840
people in other parts of the world it's like super 
cheap to travel to somewhere like thailand and so  

103
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:14,800
um i need to save up some money and go because in 
the culture i mean even where you're at in india  

104
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:21,040
it's so different than like the culture that i 
grew up with and it really interests me and um  

105
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,120
like being here in spain even it's still very 
westernized so it's honestly like some things are  

106
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,520
different than they are in the us but some things 
are and so i would like to visit somewhere that's  

107
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,400
like really different you know yes because 
in india everything is different from the us  

108
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,400
like you know the culture is totally different 
over here our eating styles everything is  

109
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:53,200
different our clothing habits everything asian 
countries have a lot in common i would say  

110
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:59,760
like you know japan um then thailand india 
china and all of these they have a little common  

111
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,600
but um well i'd not say that they have a 
lot of common with the western countries  

112
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,200
yes exactly exactly and that's the thing like 
europe and the us kind of have together but  

113
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,240
anyways we only have like 40 seconds but it 
was so nice to meet you and to talk to you  

114
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,880
um yes i hope that you have a 
wonderful rest of your night

115
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,840
yes you do awesome thank you bye bye
