00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:03,593
- What's up guys?

4
00:00:03,593 --> 00:00:05,700
This is Jerry Rig on SuperSaf TV.

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,624
- What's up guys?

00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:09,420

- What's up guys?

9
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:14,670
This is Austin Evans on SuperSaf TV.

10
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,550
- Super, SuperSafilicious.

11
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,263
- What's up guys?

12
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:20,910
It's Jaime Rivera from
Pocketnow here on SuperSaf TV.

13
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,580
- Hey there guys, it's
Mr. Q from Raqami TV here

14
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,230
on SuperSaf TV.

15
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,520
- What's up guys?

16
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,460
This is Michael Fisher on SuperSaf TV.

17
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,470
- Hey guys, Jenna Ezarik
here on SuperSaf TV.

18
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,303
- What's up guys?

19
00:00:32,303 --> 00:00:34,560
I'm Tom, The Tech Chap on SuperSaf TV.

20
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,530
- Hi, I'm Michael Josh,
your gadget matchmaker

21
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,420
on SuperSaf TV.

22
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,253
- What's up guys?

23
00:00:40,253 --> 00:00:42,060
This is David on SuperSaf TV.

24
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,893
- What's up guys?

25
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:45,330
This is Jon Rettinger back on SuperSaf TV.

26
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,600
- Hey guys, this is Colonel
Singala here for SuperSaf TV.

27
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,433
- What's up guys?

28
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,850
Saf here on SuperSaf TV.

29
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,650
And it's the one you've
all been waiting for,

30
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,320
the end-of-year
SuperSaf-Style collaboration

31
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,990
where we find out which 2023 smartphones,

32
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,120
some of your favorite
YouTubers choose to use

33
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,100
and are taking with them to 2024.

34
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,470
Now as always, there will
be two parts to this video.

35
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,320
In this video, we will be
looking at just smartphones.

36
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,370
But in the next video,

37
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,870
we'll have a bit of a rewind

38
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,510
and look at the best tech of 2023,

39
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,980
not including smartphones.

40
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,780
If you want to be one of
the first to see that,

41
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,510
then be sure to subscribe
and hit that bell icon,

42
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,530
so you don't miss it.

43
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,490
Right, to kick things off,

44
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,440
which smartphone do I choose to use?

45
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,540
Well, I have two sim cards,

46
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,120
one in an iPhone and
one in an Android phone.

47
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,220
The iPhone, it's very, very simple.

48
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,710
It's the big one, it's
the iPhone 15 Pro Max.

49
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,543
For me,

50
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:35,100
this still has the best and
most consistent camera package

51
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,270
for photos and videos.

52
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,000
Performance has been
great with the A17 Pro.

53
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,380
Excellent battery life

54
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,200
and finally, finally USB type C,

55
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,390
so I don't have to carry
around multiple cables,

56
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,070
especially with my Android smartphones.

57
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,320
And now my Android smartphone does change

58
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,153
throughout the year,

59
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:51,750
depending on what I'm reviewing.

60
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,720
But the device that my sim
card keeps going back into,

61
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,510
was actually one that
released early in the year

62
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,990
and that is of course the
Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.

63
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,050
Now, yes, it looks just
like the S22 Ultra.

64
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,870
But the fact that it still
holds up almost a year on,

65
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,580
is a testament to how good it is.

66
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,190
It's a great all-rounder
with excellent cameras.

67
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,080
The best extended zoom on any smartphone.

68
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,930
And this year, we had the
8 Gen 2 across the board,

69
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,450
no split between Qualcomm and Exynos.

70
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,580
That's me, let's see what
the others have chosen.

71
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,413
- What's up guys?

72
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:23,580
This is Austin Evans on SuperSaf TV.

73
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,960
My favorite smartphone of this year,

74
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,540
is a really clear and obvious choice.

75
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,890
You saw it a mile away.

76
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,330
It's the iPhone 15 Pro.

77
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,630
Honestly, this phone is incredibly solid

78
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,920
in every possible way.

79
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,753
I mean that.

80
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:37,320
Not only is the build quality terrific,

81
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,880
we finally got USB-C.

82
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,550
And for me, I spend a
lot of time using this

83
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,450
as my main shooter,

84
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,280
not only for photos but also for video.

85
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,200
And the fact that I
can walk into an event,

86
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,480
or pretty much anywhere I'm
going with just this phone

87
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,450
and capture all the content I
need, is such a game changer.

88
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,070
The iPhone have always
been good for video,

89
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,420
but the screen, the performance,

90
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,640
like there's basically nothing
I can really complain about

91
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,473
with this

92
00:02:57,473 --> 00:02:59,280
and that is an incredibly
impressive thing.

93
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,840
So I love the Z Flip,

94
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,130
but honestly, the iPhone's beginning

95
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,880
to become my main gadget
like period, right now.

96
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,200
- What's up guys?

97
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,710
This is Michael Fisher on SuperSaf TV.

98
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,290
Saf, you ever think of doing
this round-up at a time of year

99
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,650
when I'm not utterly fried
and completely insane

100
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,483
with exhaustion?

101
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:18,316
No?

102
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:19,149
Fine.

103
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:20,580
What smartphone do I use?

104
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,413
All of them.

105
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:23,820
But hinges are preferred

106
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,110
and in that category,

107
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,120
the OnePlus Open is the one I would choose

108
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,140
if you made me pick just one
in the large-format category.

109
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,020
And in the flip-phone-clamshell category,

110
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,550
the Motorola Razr Plus,

111
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,550
or on your side of the ocean,
the Razr 40 Ultra, I think.

112
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,230
That's what the thing is,
the nicer one, the red one,

113
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,880
the leather one.

114
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,290
And I carry them together,

115
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,900
because I'm just that perverted.

116
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,900
And I don't have either
one with me right now,

117
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,660
because I'm using other
phones I would rather not use,

118
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,790
so I can do my job.

119
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,050
Thanks for the shade by the way.

120
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,883
- What's up guys?

121
00:03:58,883 --> 00:04:01,830
This is Gaurav, a.k.a.
Technical Guruji on SuperSaf TV.

122
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,340
And my pick for this
year's smartphone is this,

123
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,190
the all new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5,

124
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,640
especially in this new
bespoke yellow color option.

125
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,430
Now this phone is quite an
improvement from the last year's,

126
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,520
because now what we have
is a full immersive screen

127
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,353
on the outside,

128
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:20,940
capable of running almost
any app that you want.

129
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,560
The phone feels fresh.

130
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,360
Now with the zero-gap hinge,

131
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,830
I mean the form factor is quite improved.

132
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,320
And considering it's a small, tiny phone,

133
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,720
good for all the fun,
good for all the eyeballs.

134
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,940
And I mean this is my pick for this year,

135
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,460
the all new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5.

136
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,293
- What's up guys?

137
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:39,330
It's Jaime Rivera from
Pocketnow here on SuperSaf TV.

138
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,890
It has been a great year for phones,

139
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,450
but if I had to pick only one,

140
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,850
it would be the iPhone 15 Pro Max.

141
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,410
Sure, it's got the looks,

142
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,810
new materials and more powerful telephoto,

143
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,270
but what I've liked most is performance.

144
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,210
I've used iPhones for years as a B-camera,

145
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,480
but LOG video combined with
that Blackmagic Camera app,

146
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,140
has made me a believer in a
phone becoming my A-camera

147
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,130
at some point.

148
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,540
Same thing with gaming

149
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,220
where the words console quality,

150
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,380
have been tossed around
a lot with smartphones.

151
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,470
But this is the first phone
to actually pull it off.

152
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,800
I think the word Pro fits
the name now more than ever.

153
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,930
Saf, again, thank you
so much for having me.

154
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,510
- Super, SuperSafilicious.

155
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,740
Hey!

156
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,370
Hey guys, this is Colonel
Singala here for SuperSaf TV

157
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,290
and welcome to my favorite
smartphone of 2024.

158
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,253
It's the OnePlus Open and close.

159
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,780
Open and close is back.

160
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,820
Yes, the OnePlus Open,

161
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,190
this is the most freshest phone ever.

162
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,180
Because you know what?

163
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,800
I can open and close,

164
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,500
plus we have that very sexy camera bump

165
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,790
and this very nice display of
faux leather made from petrol.

166
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,870
I love petrol.

167
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,600
Anyway, this phone is
smooth, it's vibrant,

168
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,020
big screen, great camera,
great for multitasking,

169
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,960
so I can (indistinct) and enjoy myself.

170
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,095
So Colonel Singala signing out,

171
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:01,345
open and close.

172
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:03,872
(Colonel Singala laughs)

173
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:04,705
Take it!

174
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:07,590
- Hi, I'm Michael Josh,
your gadget matchmaker

175
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,600
on SuperSaf TV.

176
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,760
You know, I love my iPhone.

177
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,960
And for most of this year,

178
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,170
I've been rocking the iPhone 14 Pro Max.

179
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,930
Of course, last September,
after the iPhone event,

180
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,250
I switched to the 15 Pro
Max in natural titanium.

181
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,100
The cameras on this phone are excellent,

182
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,910
but I especially love this
brushed titanium finish.

183
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,970
It's lightweight and
even matches my Oura Ring

184
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,260
and Apple Watch Ultra 2 with
my titanium strap from Nomad.

185
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,020
- Hey there guys, it's
Mr. Q from Raqami tv here

186
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,730
on SuperSaf TV.

187
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,920
Another year, another wrinkle.

188
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,650
You see, I'm a big fan
of the Samsung Fold5.

189
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,726
However this has taken over.

190
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:49,559
(taps)

191
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,450
This is the OPPO Find N3.

192
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,580
You see, I love how slim this is.

193
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,350
I love the sharp edges,

194
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,300
just the flat surface is really awesome.

195
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,880
It's got a really lovely screen as well.

196
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,590
Plus of course, open it up

197
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,920
and then you can see
that splash in your face.

198
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,630
Guys, the software on
this is pretty awesome

199
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,800
when it comes to multitasking.

200
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,770
I can go ahead and just open
up loads of different apps

201
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,940
at the same time

202
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,980
and see them basically full screen.

203
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,960
And it's cheaper than the Fold5.

204
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,340
Now, when it comes to an iOS device,

205
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,900
obviously, we're going
to have to choose this,

206
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,490
the iPhone 15 Pro.

207
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,323
Not the Pro Max,

208
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:23,070
because I'm actually Team Mini.

209
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,720
This is a pretty nice phone.

210
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,553
Why?

211
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:27,480
First of all, the titanium
little rounded edges,

212
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,520
just feel really nice to hold in the hand.

213
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,950
It definitely feels lighter as well.

214
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,200
Also, don't forget that we've got USB-C,

215
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,630
which means that finally
we can use one cable

216
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,980
to rule them all.

217
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,470
Guys, those are my two devices.

218
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,480
Boom and boom!

219
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,313
All right?

220
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:44,270
Take care.

221
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,103
(air whooshing)

222
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:47,100
- And just as I was editing this video,

223
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,560
we have hit 2 million subscribers.

224
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,990
Thank you to everybody for subscribing.

225
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,220
If you haven't already, do
consider joining the 2 million.

226
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,540
Let's get back to the video.

227
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,060
- Hey, it's Justine here on SuperSaf TV.

228
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,130
So the phone that I
have been using in 2023,

229
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,740
other than my iPhone 15 Pro Max,

230
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,573
yeah, I know,

231
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:07,020
I mean it's still a surprise like, "Hi,"

232
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,490
I have an I in front of my name,

233
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,500
I am who I am, just let me be,

234
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,570
the Pixel 8 Pro.

235
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,670
I have been loving this phone so much.

236
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,430
My sister and I actually did
a really fun livestream review

237
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,630
with Google this year.

238
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,070
So that was a lot of fun to do.

239
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,420
But I've really been loving the phone.

240
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,190
Not only do I just love the color,

241
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,360
but just this design,

242
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,250
it just feels different, it feels unique.

243
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,570
And I've always been a huge fan

244
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,920
of the way that the Pixels look.

245
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,930
And of course, it's deep
integration with Google

246
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,130
and all of the things that they're doing

247
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,360
with their AI initiative,

248
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,100
I am so here for it.

249
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,190
- Hey guys, Ashwin from
C4ETech on SuperSaf TV

250
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,300
and my favorite phone this year
has got to be the Nubia Z50.

251
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,363
Well, technically, it did
launch five days before 2023,

252
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,910
but I got it this year

253
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,000
and it's the one that
surprised me the most.

254
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,900
An 8 Gen 2 for 300-something
dollars, right around launch.

255
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,120
I went in with very tempered expectations,

256
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,380
but what I ended up getting,

257
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,410
was a solid phone I enjoyed using.

258
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,530
It even had a unique 35
millimeter equivalent lens,

259
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,360
paired with a solid sensor

260
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,420
with good software, a very
ergonomic form factor,

261
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,260
a faux leather back

262
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,960
that let you actually use the phone naked.

263
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,090
I mean this phone, the Nubia Z50,

264
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,830
I feel it's the perfect example

265
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,590
of a product punching way
over its weight class.

266
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,423
- What's up guys?

267
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:22,920
This is Jon Rettinger back on SuperSaf TV.

268
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,180
Another year has gone by

269
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,340
and I'm here to tell you
what my favorite smartphone

270
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,750
that I used all year is

271
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,460
and it's two phones.

272
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,310
On one hand, it is the iPhone 15 Pro Max,

273
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,080
'cause it's the iPhone,

274
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,850
the sort of the best of everything.

275
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,170
But the other phone
that's been in my pocket

276
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,003
since it came out

277
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:41,220
that I think is going to
be my phone well into 2024,

278
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,860
my sweet foldy boy, the OnePlus Open.

279
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,120
I love the aspect ratio,

280
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,890
I love the screen, love the technology.

281
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,330
It's not perfect,

282
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,470
but it's really close

283
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,790
when it comes to the world of foldables.

284
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,623
- What's up guys?

285
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,820
This is Jerry Rig on SuperSaf TV.

286
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,110
And for the past 13 years,
I've been an Android user.

287
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,450
But I decided to give iPhone a chance

288
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,300
and I have been doing so
for the past three months.

289
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,150
However, I'm switching back to Android.

290
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,440
Very long story short,

291
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,770
I can get more done on
Android with less taps

292
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,770
and I can schedule text
messages on Android,

293
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,520
which is important to me and
not a feature the iPhone has.

294
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,353
- What's up guys?

295
00:10:18,353 --> 00:10:20,130
This is David on SuperSaf TV.

296
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,530
And I don't really have
a daily phone that I use.

297
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,730
I try to switch into whatever phone

298
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,440
that I'm doing a video on next.

299
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,640
But I will say that one phone

300
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,880
that I keep thinking about wanting to use,

301
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,590
is the Google Pixel Fold.

302
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,210
Its shape just kind of reminds me

303
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,460
of a Moleskine notebook in the best way.

304
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,830
And it's just so nice
to have Pixel cameras

305
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,080
and all that entails on a folding phone.

306
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,660
It's something I feel like we
all just have always wanted

307
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,780
if only the battery life
didn't suck as much as it did.

308
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,190
Maybe they'll do better with the next one.

309
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,200
- Hey guys, Jenna Ezarik
here on SuperSaf TV.

310
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,060
And for my 2023 smartphones,

311
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,170
I've been rocking the iPhone
15 Pro Max in natural titanium,

312
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,020
as well as the Google Pixel 8 Pro.

313
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,000
I love having the five-time telephoto.

314
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I love all of the AI features
and best take on the Google.

315
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,320
And I'm always rocking an iPhone.

316
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,153
So there you have it.

317
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:08,400
That's what I've been rocking
as my main devices in 2023.

318
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,233
- What's up guys?

319
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,520
I'm Tom, The Tech Chap on SuperSaf TV.

320
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,590
Now obviously, there's been a
ton of great phones this year.

321
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,320
But for me, what I've been
carrying in my pockets,

322
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,153
well, there's two.

323
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:19,110
This guy, this is the OnePlus Open,

324
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,750
which I reckon is the best foldable phone,

325
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,650
you can buy right now.

326
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,240
I absolutely love this thing.

327
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
And also the iPhone 15 Pro Max,

328
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,710
which I'm recording this
on in 4K cinematic mode.

329
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,540
I just wish there was a 4K 60 mode,

330
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,830
so I can then slow it down afterwards

331
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,150
to get those nice slow-mo shots.

332
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,270
But yeah, mostly for video
and also the ecosystem,

333
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,400
the iPhone's been my main phone this year.

334
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,233
- Hey, what's up?

335
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,640
MKBHD here on SuperSaf TV.

336
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,230
So we're talking smartphones.

337
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,270
Favorite phone of the year for me,

338
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,530
there's a lot to pick from.

339
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,690
I think we've seen all of
them come out by this point.

340
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,700
And I think my favorite one is the one

341
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,320
that I'm going back to daily driving

342
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,090
after testing all the other phones,

343
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,480
which right now for me is the Pixel 8 Pro.

344
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,097
Lot of software features on this one.

345
00:11:59,097 --> 00:11:59,930
(Marques giggles)

346
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,810
It's not really about the hardware,

347
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,890
it's got nice hardware too.

348
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,510
But it's so much software

349
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,220
to the point where if you live in a region

350
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,130
where not all of the software
features are enabled,

351
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,750
it's a notably worse phone.

352
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,130
But I live in a region

353
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,230
where I do have all the software
features and they're great.

354
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,150
So I like this phone a lot.

355
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,230
- So there we have it,

356
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,063
the smartphones

357
00:12:17,063 --> 00:12:19,113
that some of your favorite
YouTubers choose to use,

358
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,600
2023-24 edition.

359
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,330

And God willing, insha'Allah,

371
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,080
we will have the big 10th-year
anniversary next year.

372
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,240
So stay tuned for that.

373
