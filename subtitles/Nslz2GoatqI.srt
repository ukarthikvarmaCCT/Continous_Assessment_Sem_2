1
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:53,559
This is the third hill resort
of Khanna-Khurana chain of hotels

2
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:57,079
And I assure you, in
the coming few months...

3
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,479
we will start three more resorts
in the country

4
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,142
By doing this in this something you
have added that to this something

5
00:01:09,432 --> 00:01:12,712
This is my cousin, Mr. Khurana. He has
lived in America for the last 20 years

6
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:15,192
He has been looking after
a business in hotels there

7
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:18,952
He finds it difficult to find
appropriate words in Hindi

8
00:01:19,432 --> 00:01:24,432
He wishes to say that since you have
attended the inauguration function...

9
00:01:24,632 --> 00:01:27,552
we are thankful to you
with all our hearts

10
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:33,352
I now wish to do to you that
about our something

11
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:38,632
There's no lack of that...

12
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:42,912
but this will be the
only one of its kind

13
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:45,033
Health resort!

14
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:49,433
Everything here will be
under one of that

15
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:54,536
Every facility in the world will be
available under one roof

16
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:58,374
Oh yes. And you can do that here,
and that...

17
00:01:58,454 --> 00:02:00,553
and of course, that too

18
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:06,651
He means you have can have
programmers here, exercises...

19
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:09,451
and of course, always
have relaxation

20
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:33,053
Congratulations, I'm Pedro.
- I'm Khanna

21
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:36,297
This is my younger brother,
my darling, my pet Sayba

22
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:38,792
I'm that...
- Khurana.

23
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:42,032
Well Khanna, Khurana...?
You bring up a swanky resort...

24
00:02:42,232 --> 00:02:45,512
bang opposite our own resort and
you don't even send us an invite?

25
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,323
No, that's because that happened.
- We forgot in haste!

26
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:51,633
Forgot...? But we haven't

27
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,713
We've even brought a gift for you.
- Gift...?

28
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:55,673
Take it

29
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:01,168
What insolence is that...?
- Who are you?

30
00:03:01,453 --> 00:03:02,288
A.C.P. Pandey!

31
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:08,488
Take the hotel apart!
Break it down!

32
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:11,168
And tear apart anyone
who comes in your way

33
00:03:24,686 --> 00:03:29,968
Only one man runs hotels in
this area. And that is Pedro!

34
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:58,766
Where did these guys
spring from...?

35
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:06,288
Every time you stand up to me,
this is how you'll get beaten up

36
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,409
Don't... don't wreck things!

37
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:40,659
I told you not to come before me!
That I'd beat you up!

38
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:44,907
Mr. Bulldozer, you must've
told my brother, not me

39
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:53,296
Forget a hotel, if someone even
tries to start an eatery here...

40
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:55,484
I'll bury him alive.
You get that?

41
00:05:27,188 --> 00:05:30,724
"Boom boom...
the world's at our feet"

42
00:05:30,804 --> 00:05:34,129
"We've got to prove it
to everyone"

43
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,684
"On our lips
is a song..."

44
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:41,080
"everyone must listen"

45
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,457
"Listen to me, friends..."

46
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:47,857
"to hell with the world"

47
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:51,417
"Every game of life..."

48
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:54,857
"you must win, never lose"

49
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,177
"Whatever will be will be..."

50
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,737
"don't worry about the future,
just enjoy yourselves"

51
00:06:01,977 --> 00:06:05,097
"What have we to lose,
what have we go gain...?"

52
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:08,937
"we came with nothing,
we will leave without anything"

53
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:12,324
"Boom boom...
the world's at our feet"

54
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:15,837
"We've got to prove it
to everyone"

55
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,307
"On our lips
is a song..."

56
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:22,832
"everyone must listen"

57
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:34,537
"What's life...?
Live it up with style"

58
00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:46,857
"Someone tells you
to become a doctor..."

59
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:50,297
"someone asks you
to become an engineer"

60
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:53,817
"Smile, listen to everyone..."

61
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:57,337
"and do what your hearts wants to"

62
00:06:57,457 --> 00:07:00,737
"Whatever will be will be..."

63
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:04,257
"don't worry about the future,
just enjoy yourselves"

64
00:07:04,497 --> 00:07:07,697
"What have we to lose,
what have we go gain...?"

65
00:07:07,937 --> 00:07:11,217
"we came with nothing,
we will leave without anything"

66
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:14,857
"Boom boom...
the world's at our feet"

67
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,337
"We've got to prove it
to everyone"

68
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,777
"On our lips
is a song..."

69
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:25,377
"everyone must listen"

70
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:42,177
"Stop feeling shy, friends..."

71
00:07:42,457 --> 00:07:46,137
"walk in step with us"

72
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:49,417
"Who'd dare clash with us...?"

73
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:52,897
"we're the strongest ones.
The rest don't matter"

74
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:56,297
"Whatever will be will be..."

75
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:59,937
"don't worry about the future,
just enjoy yourselves"

76
00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:03,377
"What have we to lose,
what have we go gain...?"

77
00:08:03,537 --> 00:08:06,937
"we came with nothing,
we will leave without anything"

78
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:10,297
"Boom boom...
the world's at our feet"

79
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,897
"We've got to prove it
to everyone"

80
00:08:13,977 --> 00:08:17,337
"On our lips
is a song..."

81
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:20,817
"everyone must listen"

82
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:01,964
I've been the principal in several
colleges over the last many years

83
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:07,684
But this year at this college
has been the best year of my life

84
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:10,044
Look! I've lost all my hair

85
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:13,524
My wife has walked out on me

86
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,324
See! Am I not happy?

87
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:23,884
But as your friend, I wish to advise
you and especially Chantu and Bantu...

88
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:27,924
that you've had enough fun at
the college. Get serious now

89
00:09:28,004 --> 00:09:31,724
And bring glory to this college
and your parents' name

90
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:35,724
What whatever you will...
- In style!

91
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,247
We had a nice thing going with
Rani and Sheena...

92
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:23,887
their father was the villain.
- He was a moron

93
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:27,527
He didn't give sons-in-law like us
our due. He's going to regret it

94
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:30,287
And what is it with us...?
We'll find someone else

95
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:33,127
We're not going to waste our
youthfulness waiting for someone!

96
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:35,567
Yes, my girl wasn't any
great shakes anyway

97
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,687
I took a liking to her because
her father was a millionaire

98
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,687
Why did you have to hire
this car at 5000 rupees an hour?

99
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,732
Looks like we're going to
woo a girl and not for an interview

100
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:47,652
You don't understand. If we go
in an expensive car...

101
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:51,892
maybe they'll give us a top post.
- Oh yes. And who pays the rent?

102
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:55,332
I've made arrangements for that.
Just remember formula 36

103
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:57,492
Really?
- Yes.

104
00:10:58,181 --> 00:11:01,772
Hey 26... switch off
that bloody music!

105
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:05,361
Don't churn my brains! My
piddly thing has racked it enough

106
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:08,532
Pay attention here, guy

107
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:12,561
This is the map of the bank

108
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:15,532
The one we're going to rob today

109
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:21,124
Smartass! What did you tell me?
We're going to kidnap Shyamlal today!

110
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:23,804
We gotta rob a bank today.
That's it

111
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:26,524
Stop wasting my time
and took a look at this

112
00:11:27,044 --> 00:11:30,804
Look... our car will stop here.
Get it?

113
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:34,124
Get into the bank straightaway...
don't be scared

114
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:37,924
You'll meet Madan Chikna
in the bank. You get...?

115
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:40,724
He'll wink his left eye at you,
you wink your right at him...

116
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:42,690
and straightaway get into
the manager's cabin

117
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,354
Hold a gun to the manager's temple.
Say, "Hands up. Don't move!"

118
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:48,668
"I'll finish you..."
Pretend to be angry, what?

119
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:53,997
Hey hero... you see that bank
there? Park the car in front of it

120
00:11:54,077 --> 00:11:55,748
Hurry up!

121
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:09,884
Stay here, okay...?
Don't go away anywhere

122
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:16,159
He chickened!

123
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:20,599
Straighten your tie.
We've got to give an interview

124
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:26,984
Looks like the owner
hasn't arrived yet

125
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,504
Appears to be a very poor
man's office to me

126
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:31,225
Will he give us a salary at all?

127
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:34,116
We'll shove our hands
in his throat and pull it out.

128
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:37,384
Nobody gets away with our stuff!

129
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:40,679
News in the market is that the boss of
this company is rolling in the stuff

130
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:43,584
But why's the office
in such a dilapidated condition?

131
00:12:43,922 --> 00:12:47,295
He must either be scared of the
underworld or must be a miser at heart

132
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,824
Ask him to come here and
give us a good job

133
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:53,277
Hey Uncle...

134
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:56,477
call the old man, will you?

135
00:12:57,437 --> 00:12:58,278
Who?

136
00:12:58,557 --> 00:13:00,957
Your boss, Mr. Kelkar.
Call him here

137
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:06,637
You've brought all the papers?
- Yes, I've had enough of this tie

138
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:16,197
You gone off your rocker...?
Don't sit in the boss's chair

139
00:13:16,357 --> 00:13:18,357
If he comes here,
he'll kick you out

140
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:20,957
You won't even be able to sell
incense sticks at this age!

141
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:26,197
I am the boss of this company.
Kelkar

142
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:29,197
Sir... you, sir?

143
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,757
I believe in the principles
of Mahatma Gandhi

144
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:37,077
Simple living, high thinking

145
00:13:41,144 --> 00:13:45,231
Because of people like you, this
country is saved from ruin, sir!

146
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:50,637
We'll be proud to work for you, sir.
- To employ the two of you...

147
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:54,677
I'll be ashamed of myself!
- How can you say such a thing, sir?

148
00:13:54,757 --> 00:13:57,934
You won't find workers like us
even in broad daylight, sir!

149
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,560
I need hardworking people.
Marketing takes a lot of hard work

150
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,880
It isn't meant for those who go
around in their father's Mercedes!

151
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:10,720
Sir, give us a chance...
we'll work our soles off, sir!

152
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:14,240
I don't want to take chances
by giving you guys a chance

153
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,280
Get up!

154
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,920
Gandhiji had such high hopes
of the youth. And you...

155
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,200
Long face! Cut the crap now,
okay?

156
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,240
We don't want to work at a
fagged out place like this, okay?

157
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,360
Let's go, Chantu!

158
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,280
Loafers!

159
00:14:36,723 --> 00:14:39,895
Kelkar has cancelled my contract
because of you guys

160
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:43,295
Did I send you to ask him
for a job or to abuse him?

161
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:46,735
One last time, Lolly... find
us a job, please. One last time

162
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:49,175
Doing that for you has
made holes in my pocket!

163
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,999
One last time, Lolly...
we made a mistake. Please!

164
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,686
There's just one way out now

165
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:56,435
Admissions are on in Goa's
hotel management institute

166
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:59,675
They'll not only teach you there,
but also pay you a salary

167
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:04,115
Why're you laughing?
- An astrologer once told his father...

168
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:06,355
that he'd grow up to feed
thousands of people!

169
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:09,235
But what he didn't say was that
he'd grow up to become a waiter!

170
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:14,315
Because of this behaviour, no one will
employ you to even swab the floor!

171
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:19,075
This is no small hotel.
It's a big one... a 5-star

172
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:23,978
Don't tell me! We'll get to live
and eat in a 5-star hotel?

173
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:27,206
If you land the job, you'll
even get to sleep there

174
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,286
Send us there quickly, Lolly!
- Send you...?

175
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:32,286
Give me 20,000. I'll send you over.
- What...?

176
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:35,206
You'll take 20,000 from the
unemployed...? Have you no shame?

177
00:15:35,406 --> 00:15:37,513
I've been doing that
for the last 3 months!

178
00:15:37,593 --> 00:15:42,166
If I'm not shameless now, I'll have
to stand with a ball my life!

179
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:46,286
In that case, I'll dump the
20,000 on your table next week!

180
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:48,006
Make it my face rather

181
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:53,988
Your name...?
- Rajaram

182
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:55,123
Rajaram

183
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:58,508
Here you are. Sign here
and pay the money

184
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:03,188
Why're you collecting 10 rupees
for every money-order form...?

185
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,988
We need twenty grand, Bantu!
Think about it!

186
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:08,828
Have patience.
Sweet is the fruit of patience

187
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:11,108
Here comes another customer.
- Now!

188
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:14,468
Please fill up the form for me.
- Right. How much money you're sending?

189
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:16,588
27,000 rupees.
- I see

190
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:20,713
Let me have the address.
- Out of my mind!

191
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:25,487
Make the payment.
- Take the money.

192
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:28,908
That's twenty rupees!

193
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:32,803
The money he was sending,
I've directed to my house!

194
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:35,173
In the sender's column,
I've written your father's name

195
00:16:35,507 --> 00:16:38,187
I'm gonna receive the
27,000 at home now!

196
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,830
You're going to rob that man?
- Who's robbing him?

197
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:42,962
As soon as we got the job
in the 5-star hotel...

198
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:45,882
we'll return the money with interest.
I have the Jodhpur address anyway

199
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:49,922
You must've been born after
a hundred scoundrels died!

200
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,362
And a scoundrel's brother
is a dog and a scoundrel too!

201
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,000
It's so crowded here!

202
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:32,760
I don't think our turn will ever come.
- Yes, looks like we've blown the money

203
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,080
Want an admission guys...? I have
a setting with the manager himself

204
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:39,880
I'll get it for you in a moment.
- He's trying to con us

205
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,720
We don't talk to
small fries, okay?

206
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:51,291
Our turn's next.
- What conmen!

207
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:53,560
Crazy guy, don't look at him

208
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,920
That's fifty thousand. Count it.
- It's all right

209
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:01,384
Bantu, there is something wrong

210
00:19:02,024 --> 00:19:05,504
Everything is wrong.
- What do you mean?

211
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,424
Just that the manager of
this hotel is collecting 50,000

212
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:11,064
from everyone for an admission.

213
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:14,624
50,000? For a waiter's job?

214
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:18,864
Oh yes. Corruption is here
to stay in our country

215
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:22,704
It's not happening. Let's go.
- Sit down!

216
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,904
We'll use formula 36. The manager
will give us an admission...

217
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:27,824
and also go down on his knees.
Just you see!

218
00:19:39,032 --> 00:19:40,632
You're here for the course?
- Yes, sir

219
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:43,368
Why did you choose this profession?
- Because I hope...

220
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,512
to start my own 5-star hotel
someday, sir

221
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:49,791
Really? You mean you will learn
in our institute...

222
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:53,991
and start a hotel to compete with
us? Biting the hand that feeds, eh?

223
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:56,671
No, you're getting it all wrong, sir.
- So I'm getting it all wrong!

224
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:59,077
You mean, there's something
wrong with my brains!

225
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,031
I didn't say that, sir.
- Did I say it then...?

226
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:05,351
You think I'm mad? Crazy?
I've sprung horns on the head?

227
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:09,682
A man who can't respect his elders
must leave. Get out!

228
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,431
It wasn't deliberate, sir!

229
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:18,839
I'll go and take a wash...
- Where the hell are you going...?

230
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,351
I wonder where they come from!

231
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,515
Sir...
- What is it?

232
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:27,151
You drove him away?
- He's in the bathroom

233
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:30,951
You must shoot the guys who
refuse to give a bribe, sir

234
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:36,751
Mr. Raj Oberoi from Oberoi Towers...?
- What?

235
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:40,551
Raj Oberoi is the owner of
a chain of 5-star hotels!

236
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:43,071
How has he got a call from him...?
Give that to me!

237
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:48,871
Answer my questions
only in yes or no

238
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:50,731
Yes, okay

239
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:54,213
Does anyone suspect that you are
Raj Oberoi's nephew?

240
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:57,351
This chap is Raj Oberoi's nephew!

241
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:00,159
No, no

242
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:05,178
You've got to gain an admission here
and serve the whole team for a year

243
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:09,538
We must send the best of the people
from here for our hotel in London

244
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:14,138
And keep an eye on Gill, the
manager of the training institute

245
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:17,283
What for?
- I'm told he's a very capable man

246
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:21,603
If we could find a man like him,
we can hoist our flag everywhere

247
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:25,185
Even if we have to pay him 10
times more the salary he's getting

248
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:31,055
We'll discuss the rest
at dinner tonight, son

249
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:35,253
Was he abusing you?
- He was giving me a job

250
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:38,053
With ten times more
the salary! In London!

251
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:41,453
He'll be coming any moment. Go and
arrange for some tea and snacks

252
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:43,213
Hurry up!
- Remember my promotion, okay?

253
00:21:43,293 --> 00:21:44,493
I take 10 percent

254
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:50,213
It's okay...

255
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:56,915
I've seen your certificates, son.
Sit down... please

256
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:59,196
May I, sir...?
- Please do. Relax

257
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,612
Nothing to worry about.
Things keep falling

258
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:06,045
When I first came to this institute
for an admission...

259
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:08,285
I spilt tea on myself!

260
00:22:09,885 --> 00:22:12,845
On a place I couldn't even
apply an ointment!

261
00:22:13,585 --> 00:22:17,125
What would you like to drink...?
- Well...? No, sir, thank you

262
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:20,861
That's all right. Eat something then.
Our fish-fingers are excellent!

263
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:24,374
All I want is an admission
and training at yours, sir

264
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:26,633
But your admission is already done.
- Really sir?!

265
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:29,547
We need capable boys like you

266
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:33,547
No, don't cry... don't

267
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:42,189
Sir, actually I have a friend outside
who's more capable than I am. If he...

268
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:45,427
So bring him along!
Of course!

269
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:05,816
Lovely place!

270
00:23:06,736 --> 00:23:10,806
I'll spend every vacation here!
- And I'm thinking of settling here

271
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:13,315
You must coming visiting me
with your wife and kids sometimes

272
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:21,228
Something like a girl
is drowning in the sea

273
00:23:21,308 --> 00:23:24,179
Not like a girl...
it's a girl who's drowning

274
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,855
Poor girl... she'll drown
if you don't go to her rescue

275
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:33,165
Why must I go ? Why not you?
- My mother told me...

276
00:23:33,466 --> 00:23:35,153
never try to save
someone who's drowning

277
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:38,525
You might drown yourself.
- And you're still sending me?

278
00:23:38,725 --> 00:23:40,445
You don't listen to your
mother's advise, do you?

279
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:44,040
Have you no human feelings...?
If she drowns...

280
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,285
I won't be able to face anyone!
- Really?

281
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:49,045
Oh yes!
- I'll go then

282
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,405
Hurry

283
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:54,554
What happened?
- My slippers

284
00:23:54,915 --> 00:23:57,714
Oh yes. Or you'll have to pinch
a pair from the temples

285
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:01,186
What happened now?
- My watch. It'll get ruined

286
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:03,272
Oh yes, bad times anyway

287
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,477
What now?
- The clothes

288
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:12,125
Take them off. Strip.
And hurry up. She'll drown

289
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:15,682
Listen, Chantu...
- What?

290
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,757
Your undies will get wet.

291
00:24:17,837 --> 00:24:19,037
A girl's dying...

292
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:20,384
and you're worried
about my undies!

293
00:24:21,984 --> 00:24:26,957
Coming... don't worry!

294
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:30,849
Not very close

295
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,609
Get her hair

296
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,569
Pull!

297
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:47,489
So simple

298
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,682
Come.

299
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,736
Is she okay?
- Yes.

300
00:24:55,816 --> 00:24:57,315
Check her.

301
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:06,472
Okay...?
- Are you okay?

302
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:13,041
If it wasn't for you, I'd have...

303
00:25:14,266 --> 00:25:15,521
I'd have died

304
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:19,521
Are you staying in this hotel?
- Yes

305
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,947
Your stay and food is
all for free from today

306
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:26,061
How come?
- I'm the owner's daughter

307
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:29,865
That's a huge loss!
- Hang on... let me see

308
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,861
If we could have a wad instead...?

309
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:35,825
Wad...? I don't understand

310
00:25:36,053 --> 00:25:38,265
Actually, we're here for
the management training

311
00:25:38,475 --> 00:25:40,065
So our food and stay is anyway...

312
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:44,825
I'm here for the training too! We'll
keep seeing each other for a year!

313
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:17,727
She had you drenched and
left us high and dry, Chantu

314
00:26:17,946 --> 00:26:20,007
Oh yes, this was terrible

315
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:24,174
I will teach you everything
that is necessary...

316
00:26:24,254 --> 00:26:27,763
for the success of any
5-star hotel

317
00:26:28,178 --> 00:26:31,538
Once you have done this course, you
can go to any hotel in the world...

318
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:34,618
use my name and land
the manager's job

319
00:26:34,898 --> 00:26:37,898
Bantu, my son... you're listening?
- Yes, sir

320
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:44,978
This course is part of the
hospitality industry

321
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:48,224
How does a hospital figure
in the hotel trade?

322
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:51,144
Hospitality means to
tend to the guests

323
00:26:51,504 --> 00:26:52,784
Taking care of the guests

324
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:56,904
The five-star hotels are visited
by top bureaucrats...

325
00:26:57,071 --> 00:27:02,304
millionaires... how to treat them
is an art in itself

326
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,224
Something I will teach you today

327
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:11,913
Chantu, stand up.
Suppose I'm a rich customer...

328
00:27:11,993 --> 00:27:15,254
and you're the waiter.
I visit your hotel...

329
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,224
show me how you're
going to behave with me

330
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:27,311
Bhola, water to table number 9.
Clean the mess at number 4

331
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:29,049
Collect 12.50 from the guy
in the glasses

332
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:32,351
What do I bring for you, sir?
Roast mutton, lentil-curry...

333
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,671
chicken biryani...
what will you have?

334
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:38,311
This is a 5-star hotel,
not a roadside eatery!

335
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:40,111
The customer will run away
at this rate!

336
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,951
You sit here.
In the customer's place

337
00:27:45,946 --> 00:27:49,351
Sundri... you show him, dear

338
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:02,173
What will you have?
- How corny could it get!

339
00:28:02,412 --> 00:28:04,973
That's good, dear.
Go back and sit down

340
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,100
May I come over, sir...?
- No, son...

341
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,380
you're going to become
a manager straightaway

342
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,660
No, you relax

343
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:18,460
Why don't you show us how one
is supposed to behave, sir?

344
00:28:18,725 --> 00:28:20,606
Of course, I'll show you

345
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:24,380
Know what? You sit here...
and I'll give you a performance

346
00:28:26,974 --> 00:28:28,700
Pay attention, everybody

347
00:28:43,592 --> 00:28:48,032
Damn you, baldie!
I don't know any English!

348
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:50,712
Forget everything else.
Do you have jhunka-bhakar...

349
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:55,712
Kolhapuri ratla and vada pav?
Bloody big mouth!

350
00:28:57,752 --> 00:29:00,314
Forget everything, brother

351
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:03,432
You got makki-di-roti
and sarson da saag...?

352
00:29:03,817 --> 00:29:05,255
No, we got pasta

353
00:29:05,428 --> 00:29:10,801
To hell with the pasta!
We got money. Here you are

354
00:29:11,547 --> 00:29:13,341
Here you are

355
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:18,254
Actually, you can also have
customers like him at times

356
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:22,614
That is when you must attend to
them with a smile like mine

357
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:24,195
Class is dismissed

358
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:32,894
He called me a waiter
in an Irani eatery...

359
00:29:32,974 --> 00:29:35,534
and we made him an attendant
at a Chinese eatery

360
00:29:35,614 --> 00:29:38,494
And he told me, "You'll become
the manager straightaway!"

361
00:29:38,702 --> 00:29:43,654
Wasn't it fun, manager...?
It's gonna be a riot!

362
00:29:44,627 --> 00:29:47,179
When he gets to know that
forget about a 5-star hotel...

363
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:50,894
your father can't even start a
tea-stall, what will he go through?

364
00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:57,534
Small-fry... eh?
Now see...

365
00:29:57,614 --> 00:30:00,734
how this small-fry makes you
dance to his tunes!

366
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:08,536
So he got into my office and
made a proper fool out of me?

367
00:30:08,696 --> 00:30:12,416
A sucker is okay, sir.
He made a fool out of you!

368
00:30:12,496 --> 00:30:14,065
They made you cut
a sorry picture!

369
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:18,055
You think you're very smart...
but he rubbed your nose in cowdung!

370
00:30:18,228 --> 00:30:19,965
Really? You seem
to be loving it?

371
00:30:20,304 --> 00:30:23,125
They still don't know
what stuff I'm made of

372
00:30:23,645 --> 00:30:26,205
You're a real scoundrel, sir.
They don't know

373
00:30:29,085 --> 00:30:30,765
You got it right, son

374
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:33,285
They've taken only
an admission

375
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:36,285
But I'm the one who will give
them marks during the test

376
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:40,365
The tests I put them to...
they'll go for a toss!

377
00:30:40,845 --> 00:30:42,125
Get to work

378
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:44,685
Now they get to face
the music!

379
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:55,365
That you and your team have
found the time...

380
00:30:55,525 --> 00:30:58,294
to visit our institute from London,
we are indeed very grateful

381
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:01,724
You have seen the institute

382
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,444
Our students will now
present to you various...

383
00:31:06,684 --> 00:31:07,564
Dishes

384
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:12,564
Yes, they will present dishes,
you must taste and give them marks

385
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:14,364
Bring the dishes

386
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,601
What are you making...?
- An Indian burger

387
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:37,921
Indian burger...? How?
- Simple

388
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:40,161
Buy a few vada-pavs
from the roadside...

389
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:42,441
make a nice design
on the bun...

390
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:46,041
decorate it with a few
onions and tomatoes...

391
00:31:46,554 --> 00:31:47,841
The Indian burger is ready!

392
00:31:51,018 --> 00:31:52,601
What happened?

393
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:55,081
What happened to her?

394
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:59,721
My lentil-curry is burnt!

395
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,361
There's going to be
a scandal today!

396
00:32:05,635 --> 00:32:10,392
I'll fail... what am I to do?
- Stop crying first, please

397
00:32:11,516 --> 00:32:13,268
I feel like crying more!

398
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,068
I had worked so hard!

399
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,188
Scandal!

400
00:32:24,628 --> 00:32:27,988
It's time for the presentation!
God! What am I going to do?

401
00:32:28,068 --> 00:32:30,148
Hang on... I have an idea

402
00:32:30,228 --> 00:32:33,722
You present his porridge and
he'll present your lentil-curry

403
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,468
Why're you messing it up for me?
- You once saved her from drowning

404
00:32:37,628 --> 00:32:39,988
You must save her again...
say yes!

405
00:32:40,148 --> 00:32:42,388
He has said yes!

406
00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:45,028
It's okay... get going!

407
00:32:48,588 --> 00:32:50,228
Come, I'll give you the porridge

408
00:32:50,308 --> 00:32:53,808
Looks like his goose
is getting cooked!

409
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:59,463
For Sundari this Kheer.
And for Chantu this Daal.

410
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:08,297
Khurana, till today, we were too
scared to taste a student's dish

411
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:12,377
And they're having a go at it.
- They're lapping it all up

412
00:33:12,497 --> 00:33:13,697
Eat it up

413
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:18,237
Try the porridge our
students have made

414
00:33:18,317 --> 00:33:20,117
You'll be left licking your fingers

415
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:22,877
You laced it, haven't you?
- Oh yes, sir

416
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:26,437
Half a kilo of salt and
a kilo of laxative

417
00:33:28,357 --> 00:33:32,157
Once they've eaten the porridge,
give away their rooms to others

418
00:33:32,448 --> 00:33:35,324
Why?
- They're going to remain in the loo

419
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,237
The boys will now land
a big egg!

420
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:42,197
Sir, the porridge has arrived!
- Really?

421
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:51,972
How did the name of Mr. Khurana's
daughter land on the porridge?

422
00:33:52,052 --> 00:33:56,068
Yet another ruse they've used.
- And it'll do us in!

423
00:33:58,868 --> 00:34:01,597
Excellent porridge!

424
00:34:09,154 --> 00:34:11,314
Porridge... this is the
one I spoke about

425
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:14,954
Are you going to do that
to the whole of it...?

426
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:17,434
Are you going to polish off
all the porridge!

427
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,314
No, sir... Only I am
eating this

428
00:34:21,344 --> 00:34:23,614
May I give your room away, sir?
- Why?

429
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,474
You're going to remain in the loo!

430
00:34:34,588 --> 00:34:36,194
Give them the bowl!

431
00:34:44,704 --> 00:34:49,106
Why's he acting like a glutton?
- So he's not exposed

432
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:52,864
His sidekick had laced your
porridge with salt and laxatives

433
00:34:53,193 --> 00:34:56,987
I saw him doing that and decided
to give your dish to Saundarya

434
00:34:57,766 --> 00:35:00,966
But why would he do that?
- We'll get to know tonight

435
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,123
How many times...?
- 21

436
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,420
What are you saying?

437
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:25,221
You've been to the loo
21 times already

438
00:35:25,301 --> 00:35:27,236
Looks like silver jubilee
is coming up

439
00:35:27,409 --> 00:35:31,334
At this rate, the golden jubilee
is not very far either

440
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:35,189
You asked me to ruin
their porridge...

441
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:37,269
and look at what
they've done to you

442
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:40,269
You're right.
This is a huge betrayal

443
00:35:40,815 --> 00:35:42,955
They first fooled me
and took an admission...

444
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:46,629
they now force the porridge on me
and make a beggar out of me!

445
00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:51,831
Pade, do something... please!
- Want me to get red undies?

446
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:57,109
Red undies...? What for?
- Red stops the biggest of trains...

447
00:35:57,189 --> 00:36:00,199
what's this?
- This train's brakes have failed

448
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:03,269
No train is stopping now!

449
00:36:04,426 --> 00:36:05,749
22 !

450
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,989
At least shut the
door properly, sir

451
00:36:09,183 --> 00:36:12,349
Bantu, we've been exposed!

452
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,130
We've escaped this time.
But he won't spare us next time

453
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:21,730
Before that time arrives,
let's shut him up permanently

454
00:36:22,112 --> 00:36:25,250
How?
- Just wait and watch

455
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:40,634
Mr. Gill ! Save me!
- From whom?

456
00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:41,832
From ruin!

457
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:47,754
I had run away from home
with my boyfriend

458
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,514
He promised me the moon...

459
00:36:50,837 --> 00:36:54,354
but once he had his fun,
he ran away from here

460
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:58,434
He didn't even settle the hotel bills!
I somehow managed to get out of there

461
00:36:58,772 --> 00:37:02,741
But I don't have money to return
home nor any shelter for the night

462
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:07,914
Mr. Gill, I've come to you
with great hopes

463
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:11,034
I'm told you have a heart
as vast as the oceans...

464
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:16,297
And?
- And you let the rivers flow unto you

465
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:18,514
It's only a matter of
a single night

466
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:20,474
I will make some arrangement
for myself tomorrow

467
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:25,194
No, you needn't worry at all. I'm the
one who'll have to do something now

468
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:28,634
You can spend as many nights
in my room as you wish to

469
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:33,274
Say that again, Mr. Gill!
I can't believe my ears!

470
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:36,234
It's okay, it's okay...

471
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:39,114
no girl is shelterless
when she's with me

472
00:37:39,486 --> 00:37:41,714
Let me show you... my room

473
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:45,794
Shall we?
- Oh yes

474
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:48,354
Come... come on in

475
00:37:48,914 --> 00:37:52,874
I didn't ask you your name.
- Nada Dhill

476
00:37:53,034 --> 00:37:55,754
Nada Dhill...?
- Nadia Dagar Singh Dhill

477
00:37:57,118 --> 00:37:59,114
Your parents knew even when
you were a child...?

478
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:01,794
Lovely name... Nada Dhill.
My name's Gill

479
00:38:02,512 --> 00:38:08,274
I know you're a decent man.
But your wife's not around, is she?

480
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:11,354
Where will my wife come from?
I'm not married yet

481
00:38:11,474 --> 00:38:13,554
Really? And how about the servants?

482
00:38:13,756 --> 00:38:16,154
The servants won't come here
until I ask them to

483
00:38:16,405 --> 00:38:20,951
God, I'm scared! You won't try to
rape me because I'm alone, will you?

484
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:24,954
Not at all! How can I even
touch you unless you consent?

485
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:30,994
Why not...? If you say it's
very hot and latch the door...

486
00:38:31,074 --> 00:38:31,914
One minute!

487
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:36,314
Switch on the a/c...
it's switched on anyway

488
00:38:38,474 --> 00:38:41,914
Set your bag on the chair
and make me sit on the bed

489
00:38:41,994 --> 00:38:42,934
Come on!

490
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:45,554
Looks like the left side
is your favourite!

491
00:38:45,714 --> 00:38:47,314
Sit down.
- One minute

492
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:53,994
The telephone here...
move it away quietly

493
00:38:54,194 --> 00:38:58,594
take off your coat,
loosen your tie...

494
00:38:58,674 --> 00:39:00,634
may I do it for you...?
- Go ahead

495
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:06,914
Now look in my eyes say,
"Will you cooperate with me?"

496
00:39:07,453 --> 00:39:09,594
I'd be so scared,
how will I say no?

497
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:12,634
Listen, will you
cooperate with me?

498
00:39:12,714 --> 00:39:16,394
There you are! I knew it!
All men are alike!

499
00:39:16,775 --> 00:39:20,575
"He makes life miserable...
the wretched Gill"

500
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:25,695
The wretched Gill...
- You sing so well. Come here!

501
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:26,945
Come to me!

502
00:39:27,194 --> 00:39:29,375
Sing for me just once!

503
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:32,307
Come...

504
00:39:33,724 --> 00:39:35,064
Look, don't climb over me!

505
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:38,135
Help! Is someone there?

506
00:39:38,215 --> 00:39:40,535
I've fallen!
- Fallen...?

507
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,375
Don't sleep on me, okay?
- No!

508
00:39:47,172 --> 00:39:48,935
Sir... what are you doing?

509
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:51,691
Save me.

510
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:55,815
I'm so happy you're here!
This old fossil was raping me!

511
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:59,118
Gill, this boy will
beat you to pulp!

512
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,575
Chantu... you?
Hello

513
00:40:02,797 --> 00:40:06,717
Where did I see you earlier, sir?
And do you stand now?

514
00:40:06,944 --> 00:40:10,037
She's lying!
I've only given her shelter!

515
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,637
Who's going to believe you
once she starts screaming, sir?

516
00:40:14,966 --> 00:40:16,237
She'll yell!

517
00:40:17,669 --> 00:40:19,557
Help!

518
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:23,680
Help!
- Shut up! Shut up!

519
00:40:25,468 --> 00:40:29,853
Why must I shut up just like that?
- Oh, I see!

520
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:32,468
Help!

521
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:34,296
She's a bitch, sir.
You got some money?

522
00:40:34,376 --> 00:40:38,388
Give it to me...
this is no time to count

523
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:40,348
All of it...?

524
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:43,265
Here you are. You'll keep your
mouth shut now, won't you?

525
00:40:43,345 --> 00:40:47,108
This will only control my tongue.
But my mouth will remain open

526
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:48,708
Big mouth!

527
00:40:48,978 --> 00:40:51,108
Give that gold chain!
- Why?

528
00:40:51,188 --> 00:40:53,168
She'll create a scene!
- Help!

529
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,767
Take it away!
- The watch...

530
00:40:55,847 --> 00:40:56,476
Help me.

531
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:58,698
I'll save your honour!

532
00:41:00,816 --> 00:41:03,428
Here you are. Another sound
from you and I'll strangle you!

533
00:41:04,385 --> 00:41:06,428
Gill, go to hell!

534
00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:16,908
What have you done, Chantu?
You gave her all my belongings?

535
00:41:17,188 --> 00:41:20,508
How can you say such a thing, sir?
If news of this had leaked...

536
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:23,588
the students would have treated you
like a pariah and spat at you!

537
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:26,028
No!

538
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,748
The management would have
kicked you out, I say!

539
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,461
Really?
- Oh yes, sir! Yes!

540
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:35,727
Thanks, Chantu. You've saved me
from a grave predicament

541
00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:39,007
You have no idea how much
I hate blackmailers, sir

542
00:41:39,207 --> 00:41:41,772
Now go and take a cold
shower, sir. Please

543
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:44,425
Yes, I'll take a shower

544
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:58,226
There are robberies everyday!
Watches and purses...

545
00:41:58,306 --> 00:42:02,861
mobiles and chains!
And you're doing nothing!

546
00:42:02,941 --> 00:42:07,036
I'm doing my best, sir.
- My foot!

547
00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:12,685
At this rate,
we'll go to the dogs!

548
00:42:38,551 --> 00:42:41,085
Working nights really
is exhausting, isn't it?

549
00:42:41,165 --> 00:42:44,551
We get no sleep and
there's no time to take a bath

550
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:48,151
Gill's class will begin and he'll
get an excuse to yell if we're late

551
00:42:48,353 --> 00:42:48,991
Yes.

552
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:50,751
So what are we doing to do?

553
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:58,591
I think this room is vacant.
I'll go and take a bath...

554
00:42:58,671 --> 00:43:01,951
you stand here. Afterwards, you
take a bath and I'll stand guard

555
00:43:39,585 --> 00:43:40,883
I'm coming!

556
00:43:45,197 --> 00:43:47,517
What happened...?
Where's the injury?

557
00:43:48,237 --> 00:43:50,237
Here... ? Here...?

558
00:43:51,037 --> 00:43:52,757
Maybe on the knee?

559
00:43:53,499 --> 00:43:54,837
Where is it then?

560
00:43:56,576 --> 00:43:58,477
Here.
- Wow!

561
00:43:59,447 --> 00:44:04,127
Clean up this room. I'll check 354,
there's a problem with the tap

562
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:32,500
Take a hot bath!

563
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:37,216
Take a hot bath!

564
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:46,556
A jacuzzi is so much more fun!

565
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,740
Where is it...?

566
00:45:18,753 --> 00:45:20,553
Khanna...
- Yes, Khurana...?

567
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:24,793
As I was saying...
- How'd I know what you were saying?

568
00:45:25,233 --> 00:45:27,593
That...
- What?

569
00:45:29,233 --> 00:45:34,193
That thing... which is broken...
let's do it to that

570
00:45:35,111 --> 00:45:37,473
Aren't you ashamed to talk
like that about your wife?

571
00:45:37,633 --> 00:45:40,474
Because she has grown old,
you want her to die?

572
00:45:40,647 --> 00:45:43,795
Khanna, what are you talking about?
It's that thing...

573
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,753
in which that thing
came the other day

574
00:45:46,751 --> 00:45:49,953
That thing which, even before
it started, faced that

575
00:45:51,075 --> 00:45:52,713
Are you talking about
the health resort?

576
00:45:54,729 --> 00:45:56,073
Don't even talk about
the health resort

577
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,433
Whenever we talk about it,
my health starts worsening

578
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:02,713
But we have so much of that
stuck in it

579
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:07,033
Why don't we do that to it?

580
00:46:07,692 --> 00:46:11,273
Yes, I understand. We have a lot
of money blocked in it

581
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:14,993
Why don't we sell it?
Of course...

582
00:46:15,346 --> 00:46:19,039
but who would want to buy it?
- Look, and you find Him...

583
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,233
can't you find him then?

584
00:46:20,686 --> 00:46:22,993
Why don't we give a that
and see?

585
00:46:25,756 --> 00:46:29,433
You mean we can even find God.
So why won't we find a sucker?

586
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:31,919
You mean, we must issue an
advertisement and see?

587
00:46:33,227 --> 00:46:36,193
Go ahead and give it.
Have posters pasted everywhere!

588
00:46:48,137 --> 00:46:51,097
In this hotel, you're...?
- A housekeeping manager

589
00:46:51,817 --> 00:46:53,537
I look after the upkeep
of the rooms

590
00:47:45,302 --> 00:47:46,471
Who went into the room?
- I, sir

591
00:47:46,551 --> 00:47:50,665
Out with the watch. Go on!
- I didn't take it, sir. I swear

592
00:47:54,892 --> 00:47:56,462
I'll check

593
00:48:09,129 --> 00:48:10,569
I apologise on his behalf

594
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,409
I swear, sir...

595
00:48:13,994 --> 00:48:15,108
Get out!

596
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:19,249
One moment!

597
00:48:20,009 --> 00:48:21,969
Without an investigation,
you cannot fire him

598
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:24,609
I'm not a cop to
investigate thieves

599
00:48:24,689 --> 00:48:27,489
You aren't a judge either to
go around punishing people

600
00:48:27,811 --> 00:48:29,289
Great dialogue, Chantu!

601
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:32,809
I'm very sure! He's the one
who committed the theft!

602
00:48:32,979 --> 00:48:36,136
That's a wrong allegation, sir.
Nikhil is being framed

603
00:48:36,355 --> 00:48:40,155
How can you be so that
to say he's not that?

604
00:48:41,867 --> 00:48:44,907
You guys are speaking as if
you know who the real thief is!

605
00:48:44,987 --> 00:48:47,267
Yes, we know him, sir.
- What?

606
00:48:47,984 --> 00:48:49,187
Sit down

607
00:48:49,882 --> 00:48:52,762
Who is it?
- There are just two people...

608
00:48:52,882 --> 00:48:55,922
in this resort who go
tip-toeing around...

609
00:48:56,082 --> 00:48:59,002
like he or he does.
- What do you mean?

610
00:48:59,172 --> 00:49:02,082
Either the owner
or the thief!

611
00:49:04,682 --> 00:49:05,602
Who is it?

612
00:49:12,048 --> 00:49:14,442
Listen... send Monica in here

613
00:49:16,058 --> 00:49:21,345
Have you any personal experience
of Monica spying around...?

614
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:29,031
A very bad experience, sir.
A terrible one

615
00:49:29,246 --> 00:49:30,246
Really?

616
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:35,486
They say that you are either
a thief or the boss

617
00:49:35,566 --> 00:49:37,846
Now tell us the truth. Who are you?
- What...?

618
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:49,269
How did you guys get to know
that I'm his daughter?

619
00:49:49,442 --> 00:49:50,406
What?

620
00:49:52,047 --> 00:49:55,006
You mean, she's...?

621
00:49:55,485 --> 00:49:57,326
your daughter?
- Trapped!

622
00:49:57,604 --> 00:50:00,447
They're going to kick us
out of the institute!

623
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,296
What...?
- Nothing, sir

624
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:06,617
Actually, we had to do that
during the security training

625
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:10,937
I'm glad you have
an eye on me

626
00:50:12,545 --> 00:50:15,017
Your daughter

627
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:17,475
Indeed. Mr. Khurana's only child

628
00:50:17,704 --> 00:50:21,664
Actually, there have been
complaints of theft at the resort

629
00:50:22,459 --> 00:50:26,104
And Monica had returned from Europe
after four years of training

630
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:28,464
And we knew that no one
recognises her here

631
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:32,584
We took advantage of that and
made her part of the staff

632
00:50:33,224 --> 00:50:37,384
So that we'd nab the thief and
she'd gain some experience too

633
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:38,504
Right?

634
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:43,904
I am suspicious about Mr. Gomes too.
But accusing him without evidence...

635
00:50:43,984 --> 00:50:46,464
will make the staff panic.
- In that case...

636
00:50:46,696 --> 00:50:48,870
if Mr. Gomes is indeed a thief...

637
00:50:49,217 --> 00:50:51,937
he'll be presented to you with
all the stuff he has stolen, sir

638
00:50:52,113 --> 00:50:52,937
What?

639
00:50:55,237 --> 00:50:58,457
Sir, at least try us out

640
00:51:02,502 --> 00:51:04,497
Who's disturbing me...?

641
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:09,991
Who's this?
- A well-wisher

642
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:11,791
Why've you called
so late in the night?

643
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:15,606
Bad news. You can't wait
for happy times

644
00:51:15,686 --> 00:51:19,130
Your bad times have begun.
- What do you mean?

645
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:24,431
Bantu and Chantu have got to know
that you are the real thief

646
00:51:24,591 --> 00:51:26,791
What...?
- That's not all

647
00:51:26,911 --> 00:51:30,431
They're going to raid your place
with the help of the police tomorrow

648
00:51:31,454 --> 00:51:33,911
You have time till tomorrow morning

649
00:51:34,914 --> 00:51:38,151
Stash away the booty.
Or you'll get exposed!

650
00:51:38,979 --> 00:51:40,911
I'll hang up now

651
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:44,471
Disconnected!

652
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,760
I must fix the stolen stuff!
The stolen stuff...

653
00:51:50,935 --> 00:51:53,840
all the stuff!
- I don't understand.

654
00:51:55,939 --> 00:51:57,040
Stolen stuff!

655
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:01,680
What are you doing?
- Put in all the jewellery

656
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,320
I'm a Madrasi from room number 306.

657
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,080
Yes? Go ahead.
- I want 10 plates of idlis

658
00:52:13,919 --> 00:52:18,880
Swami, it's 1:30 in the morning.
Is this any time for a snack?

659
00:52:19,259 --> 00:52:22,640
I've just arrived in a train
from Madras. I'm hungry

660
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,697
Hungry, all right.
I'll send it to you

661
00:52:27,022 --> 00:52:28,960
Keep waiting.
And don't call again

662
00:52:30,276 --> 00:52:32,240
Who was it...?
- A wrong number! Let's go!

663
00:52:34,005 --> 00:52:35,151
What to do now.

664
00:52:39,076 --> 00:52:40,266
Hurry up!

665
00:52:40,346 --> 00:52:42,060
What are you saying?
- Go there.

666
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,520
I forgot to order chutney...
how much will the bill be?

667
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,440
My friend, don't worry
about the bill

668
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:56,960
After midnight, we serve idli
and sambar without any cost

669
00:52:57,304 --> 00:53:01,725
But you must wait for an hour.
Okay? Please don't call again

670
00:53:02,406 --> 00:53:05,120
The knife!
- Give it to me!

671
00:53:10,936 --> 00:53:14,612
Why're you tearing the mattress?
- Shut up! You don't know

672
00:53:15,649 --> 00:53:18,120
Where is it...?
Here

673
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:22,341
Take that. This one too

674
00:53:25,487 --> 00:53:27,141
The flour...
- Want some bread?

675
00:53:27,221 --> 00:53:31,780
Shut up! The flour container!
- In the flour? What?

676
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:36,514
The watches!
Go and get them!

677
00:53:38,222 --> 00:53:41,920
Since the idli-sambar
is on the house...

678
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,840
make it 20 plates instead of 10

679
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:51,160
My friend, I'll bring 22 plates
of idlis to you tomorrow

680
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,352
The two of us will have
breakfast together

681
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:59,595
We'll eat and play...
but don't call up again!

682
00:54:00,903 --> 00:54:04,520
The things he has stuffed everywhere!
I can't figure out anything

683
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:07,000
I'm going to go mad with this man!

684
00:54:17,044 --> 00:54:19,800
Hurry up and lock it

685
00:54:23,228 --> 00:54:25,995
Where are you going with a bag
early in the morning, Mr. Gomes?

686
00:54:26,434 --> 00:54:30,954
Nowhere really. My mother-in-law
isn't keeping well...

687
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:34,206
so I'm going to look her up
at my in-laws' place

688
00:54:34,286 --> 00:54:37,119
The police are here to take you
to your in-laws

689
00:54:45,086 --> 00:54:46,697
You're trying to
fool us, Mr. Gomes?

690
00:54:46,777 --> 00:54:49,234
You're going to stash
away the stolen stuff?

691
00:54:49,443 --> 00:54:50,834
Go ahead

692
00:55:19,238 --> 00:55:21,558
They're the ones
responsible for this

693
00:55:22,038 --> 00:55:27,260
I will surely return to
settle scores with you!

694
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,420
We'll wait for you, Mr. Gomes

695
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,580
Move it

696
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,940
Gomes looked like a rat
looking into a cat's face

697
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:41,140
No, he looked like a goat
looking into a tiger's face

698
00:55:41,336 --> 00:55:44,260
That's a nice one, I say.
Here they come...

699
00:55:45,995 --> 00:55:50,914
You've caught the thief, no doubt.
But we've lost something too

700
00:55:50,994 --> 00:55:52,979
What?
- Our hearts

701
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:57,282
We don't catch petty thieves.
- We even know the thieves' names

702
00:55:57,362 --> 00:55:59,100
So go and catch them

703
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,900
Gotcha!

704
00:56:01,368 --> 00:56:03,100
Gotcha!

705
00:56:51,713 --> 00:56:52,713
"Love..."

706
00:56:53,889 --> 00:56:54,981
"love..."

707
00:56:55,856 --> 00:56:57,510
"love..."

708
00:56:58,094 --> 00:57:00,602
"we've fallen in love"

709
00:57:00,872 --> 00:57:03,833
"Love..."

710
00:57:05,045 --> 00:57:06,713
"love..."

711
00:57:07,073 --> 00:57:09,073
"we've fallen in love"

712
00:57:09,433 --> 00:57:11,513
"Love is catastrophe,
love is intoxication..."

713
00:57:11,673 --> 00:57:13,753
"love is trust,
love is faithfulness"

714
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:16,033
"Love is life,
love is every happy happiness..."

715
00:57:16,113 --> 00:57:18,365
"love is worship,
love is God"

716
00:57:18,646 --> 00:57:19,954
"Love..."

717
00:57:20,483 --> 00:57:21,543
"love..."

718
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,062
"love..."

719
00:57:30,537 --> 00:57:32,321
Let's take some pictures!

720
00:57:32,688 --> 00:57:34,153
Hold it...

721
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,520
Beautiful!

722
00:57:41,498 --> 00:57:44,993
Here's the picture!
Beautiful girls, beautiful photo

723
00:57:45,207 --> 00:57:48,153
Take a look. The magic

724
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:06,633
"In Spring, we find love.
In these sights, we find our love"

725
00:58:06,713 --> 00:58:11,233
"When we meet in love,
love blossoms like a rose"

726
00:58:19,953 --> 00:58:22,113
"Like the breeze,
love blows..."

727
00:58:22,193 --> 00:58:24,233
"like the clouds,
it hovers above us..."

728
00:58:24,313 --> 00:58:28,713
"when we get talking,
it rains love"

729
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:31,233
"Love is Spring,
love is the ambience..."

730
00:58:31,313 --> 00:58:33,313
"love is the landscape,
love is the breeze..."

731
00:58:33,513 --> 00:58:35,673
"love is life,
life is every joy..."

732
00:58:35,753 --> 00:58:37,793
"love is worship,
love is God"

733
00:58:37,913 --> 00:58:38,913
"Love..."

734
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,193
"love..."

735
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:43,598
"love..."

736
00:58:44,433 --> 00:58:46,833
"we've fallen in love"

737
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:50,633
Help! Help!

738
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:54,113
Someone there...?
Help!

739
00:58:56,873 --> 00:58:59,673
What are you thinking about?
Give me a hand...

740
00:59:00,172 --> 00:59:04,473
Do you have change for a hundred?
- For a thousand rupees, perhaps?

741
00:59:04,553 --> 00:59:05,593
Oh yes

742
00:59:15,168 --> 00:59:16,153
Get lost

743
00:59:21,593 --> 00:59:23,113
Go away... what rubbish?

744
00:59:28,313 --> 00:59:29,033
Help!

745
00:59:48,714 --> 00:59:52,833
"When one falls in love,
he becomes a Romeo..."

746
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:57,553
"when love transcends all limits,
it turns into an obsession"

747
00:59:58,109 --> 01:00:00,273
Where to...?
Give me my bottle!

748
01:00:06,282 --> 01:00:10,513
"In love, one can
do anything..."

749
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:15,153
"in love, he lives.
For love, he dies"

750
01:00:15,472 --> 01:00:19,847
"Love is pining, love is fun. Love
is the ache and love is the balm"

751
01:00:19,927 --> 01:00:21,873
"love is life,
life is every joy..."

752
01:00:21,953 --> 01:00:24,193
"love is worship,
love is God"

753
01:00:24,846 --> 01:00:26,813
Nice place, isn't it?
How about going there?

754
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:36,586
I'll be back in a moment

755
01:00:50,633 --> 01:00:51,713
"Love..."

756
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:53,913
"love..."

757
01:00:55,203 --> 01:00:56,533
"love..."

758
01:00:57,225 --> 01:00:59,713
"we've fallen in love"

759
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,252
What dance was that, guys?
- Whose idea was this?

760
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,153
Where have you landed me?

761
01:01:28,003 --> 01:01:29,713
Welcome, Your Highness

762
01:01:31,258 --> 01:01:35,096
Make way... the Queen of Janakpur
is arriving... make way

763
01:01:35,354 --> 01:01:37,434
That Queen sure has
an amazing gait

764
01:01:37,634 --> 01:01:41,714
Yes, but where is Janakpur?
- Maybe in some corner of Rajasthan

765
01:01:41,874 --> 01:01:42,751
Let's go. It's time for class

766
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:47,314
Make way, please...
Welcome, Your Highness

767
01:01:47,929 --> 01:01:49,443
Your Highness! What happened?

768
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:51,010
Manager!

769
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:53,250
What happened?
- Stay away

770
01:01:53,518 --> 01:01:56,690
The floor is so slippery,
I slipped and fell down!

771
01:01:56,770 --> 01:02:01,130
I've sprained my ankle!
Secretary! Call my lawyer!

772
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,890
Very well, Your Highness.
- But you call a doctor...

773
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,210
to attend to a sprain,
why call a lawyer?

774
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:11,370
My lawyer will sue the management!
Secretary! Phone my lawyer!

775
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:14,730
Indeed, Your Highness.
- Look... the manager has arrived

776
01:02:15,895 --> 01:02:19,777
Please don't sue us. It'll spoil
the reputation of our hotel!

777
01:02:19,857 --> 01:02:22,961
That's just what I want. If I had
slipped in Janakpur...

778
01:02:23,081 --> 01:02:25,232
I'd have blown the place up
with a bomb!

779
01:02:25,312 --> 01:02:28,721
Secretary! Phone my lawyer!
- At once!

780
01:02:28,841 --> 01:02:32,841
No, please listen to me!
We'll compensate you adequately

781
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,641
How will you compensate me?

782
01:02:35,761 --> 01:02:38,425
If I wish, I can buy out this hotel
even while I stand here!

783
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,041
Please remain sitting

784
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:44,961
We'll give you the Royal Suite.
Absolutely free of cost

785
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:48,841
You can stay for as long
as you wish. Enjoy yourself...

786
01:02:49,001 --> 01:02:50,281
but please don't file a suit!

787
01:02:51,041 --> 01:02:53,863
My sprained ankle has ruined
my vacation. How about that?

788
01:02:54,048 --> 01:02:55,968
That's okay. We'll summon
the doctor...

789
01:02:56,088 --> 01:02:58,381
provide you a car, take you
any place you wish to go...

790
01:02:58,461 --> 01:03:01,448
and you can stay for as long
as you wish. Free of cost!

791
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:08,848
All right.
I'll spare you

792
01:03:09,321 --> 01:03:12,521
Else, no one could've saved his
hotel from turning into ruins

793
01:03:13,121 --> 01:03:15,441
So where is my Royal Suite?

794
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:24,180
What do you think?
- Great! That manager will never ...

795
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,460
look you in the eye again.

796
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,260
No one had the slightest suspicion
that you are not the real queen

797
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:36,900
Why should anyone suspect?
If not by birth ...

798
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:39,340
my attitude is that of a queen

799
01:04:04,262 --> 01:04:08,182
I cut my tongue!
- What happened?

800
01:04:08,624 --> 01:04:11,624
Look, there was a glass piece
in this. I cut my tongue

801
01:04:12,344 --> 01:04:15,824
How is that possible?
- Secretary, call up my lawyer

802
01:04:15,944 --> 01:04:19,704
Queen, what happened?

803
01:04:19,784 --> 01:04:22,064
There was a glass piece
in my sweet dish

804
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,824
A conspiracy is being hatched to
kill me in this hotel

805
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:28,944
Call the police!
Secretary, call up my lawyer!

806
01:04:29,024 --> 01:04:31,468
Yes, Queen
- Forgive us one last time

807
01:04:31,674 --> 01:04:33,003
Such a mistake
will never happen again

808
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:36,106
We will provide all your meals
free of cost

809
01:04:36,315 --> 01:04:39,355
You think I live off other people,
that you are making that offer?

810
01:04:39,435 --> 01:04:42,235
It's not that. We are just trying
to compensate for our mistake

811
01:04:42,355 --> 01:04:45,715
Why do you make such mistakes?
- We won't make them henceforth

812
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:50,595
The table at the casino is ready.
- Your table is ready. Please come

813
01:05:04,871 --> 01:05:06,831
What is this, Queen?
That's all the money we have left

814
01:05:06,951 --> 01:05:09,191
If we lose even this, we won't
have money even for cigarettes

815
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:12,191
Have I ever given money to anyone,
that I will today?

816
01:05:42,714 --> 01:05:47,434
Secretary, call up my lawyer!
- What happened, Queen?

817
01:05:47,714 --> 01:05:51,634
Call the ambulance!
This rogue spilled hot coffee on me

818
01:05:54,834 --> 01:05:57,114
But why do accidents
happen only with me?

819
01:05:57,194 --> 01:06:00,269
This is a murder conspiracy.
There is someone in this hotel ...

820
01:06:00,349 --> 01:06:03,154
who is trying to murder me

821
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,658
Please forgive us,
one last time!

822
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,320
First of all,
dismiss this idiot!

823
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,720
But what mistake have I made?

824
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:27,329
Send the doctor to my room.
I want treatment

825
01:06:28,594 --> 01:06:31,438
Call the doctor!

826
01:06:34,778 --> 01:06:39,258
My mother had pawned all her
jewellery, even her wedding chain...

827
01:06:39,858 --> 01:06:41,498
to send me here for an education

828
01:06:42,086 --> 01:06:46,298
When she comes to know
I have been dismissed ...

829
01:06:46,907 --> 01:06:49,018
wonder what she will go through

830
01:06:50,326 --> 01:06:52,846
Gulshan, don't cry, please

831
01:06:52,966 --> 01:06:57,599
When you cry,
you look like smiling Chantu

832
01:06:57,846 --> 01:07:00,006
And you look like a
cartoon even when you laugh

833
01:07:02,006 --> 01:07:04,926
How could you call such a bright
student of the institute a cartoon?

834
01:07:05,086 --> 01:07:06,806
Hey! Now don't pull my leg

835
01:07:07,046 --> 01:07:09,606
We joke among ourselves.
What's your problem?

836
01:07:09,686 --> 01:07:11,366
I do have a problem.
- Forget it

837
01:07:11,446 --> 01:07:12,926
Gulshan has a greater
problem on hand.

838
01:07:13,006 --> 01:07:16,326
The counter girl of our casino...
Maria is in greater trouble than him.

839
01:07:16,926 --> 01:07:20,326
Someone stole 300,000
from her table

840
01:07:20,566 --> 01:07:23,406
The management served her a notice.
If she fails to return the money...

841
01:07:23,486 --> 01:07:25,870
within 24 hours, she will be
turned in to the cops

842
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:30,126
Don't worry. Gulshan, that queen
will apologise to you...

843
01:07:30,206 --> 01:07:33,846
and will also have you reinstated.
The stolen money will also be recovered

844
01:07:33,926 --> 01:07:37,366
Let's go.
These girls are boring us

845
01:07:43,146 --> 01:07:45,866
Look, the Queen
is coming this way

846
01:07:46,152 --> 01:07:50,586
You very conveniently told everyone
you'll make her apologise. Now what?

847
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:53,546
Let's find out if she is really
a Queen or not

848
01:07:53,752 --> 01:07:55,626
How?
- Come here

849
01:07:58,368 --> 01:07:59,266
Come on

850
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:01,780
We are going for boating,
but do you have the money?

851
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,500
Have I paid anyone until now,
that I will today?

852
01:08:05,471 --> 01:08:08,580
Right, His Highness of Janakpur
is coming

853
01:08:09,017 --> 01:08:11,740
No madam, all the cars
have gone to the airport

854
01:08:12,336 --> 01:08:14,700
To welcome the
King of Janakpur

855
01:08:15,573 --> 01:08:19,013
Yes madam, our hotel's
reputation is rising

856
01:08:19,223 --> 01:08:21,893
The Queen is already here.
With the King's arrival...

857
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:23,893
the entire royal family
will be our guest

858
01:08:24,466 --> 01:08:26,898
Yes, I will now have to leave
to welcome the King!

859
01:08:27,093 --> 01:08:30,253
Queen, did you hear that?
The real king is coming

860
01:08:30,333 --> 01:08:34,253
And we're going to jail.
- Let's run away before that

861
01:08:39,628 --> 01:08:41,908
But Queen, why are you doing this?

862
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:46,988
We are checking out!
- But we cannot let you go

863
01:08:47,148 --> 01:08:50,668
Why not?
- The King has said...

864
01:08:50,748 --> 01:08:53,860
that if the Queen is not present
in the hotel, he will behead us all

865
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:58,520
What! The King knows we are here?
- You are too much, Queen!

866
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,988
Then King surely
knows where you are

867
01:09:02,147 --> 01:09:05,427
Actually, I am annoyed with him.
That's why I don't want to meet him

868
01:09:05,806 --> 01:09:08,387
Maybe the King is
coming here to placate you

869
01:09:08,547 --> 01:09:10,387
We won't let you go

870
01:09:12,427 --> 01:09:16,067
All right, I have a
condition for staying here

871
01:09:16,547 --> 01:09:19,467
As soon as the King arrives,
I should meet him first

872
01:09:20,098 --> 01:09:22,807
I promise no one will
come between you and the King

873
01:09:22,887 --> 01:09:25,147
Did you hear?
You stay with me

874
01:09:25,827 --> 01:09:26,547
Come.

875
01:09:35,979 --> 01:09:37,707
Please, Your Highness

876
01:09:44,226 --> 01:09:49,707
Pardon us, King.
- How could you dare ...

877
01:09:49,787 --> 01:09:53,987
you two pittance of a woman,
to go around as my Queen?

878
01:09:54,301 --> 01:10:01,221
I will wash this slur on my family
with your blood

879
01:10:01,404 --> 01:10:04,151
Guard, give me my sword!

880
01:10:04,455 --> 01:10:08,464
No King!
King, even God forgives one mistake

881
01:10:08,544 --> 01:10:12,495
Consider us your subjects & forgive
us. We'll always be grateful to you

882
01:10:12,745 --> 01:10:15,815
And we'll never make
such a mistake again

883
01:10:18,908 --> 01:10:22,868
Yes King, it is more noble
to forgive than punish

884
01:10:22,988 --> 01:10:25,148
And there is no one
more nobler than you.

885
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:29,848
All right. Since you are
saying this, I'll save you ...

886
01:10:29,928 --> 01:10:32,188
from the sin of killing
a woman

887
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:39,228
But tell them they will
have to admit all their crimes

888
01:10:39,788 --> 01:10:42,868
What crimes have
you committed here?

889
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:46,756
I faked a fall
and stayed at the hotel for free

890
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:50,748
We dropped the coffee in the casino
and stole 300,000

891
01:10:51,124 --> 01:10:54,735
We put glass pieces in the sweet
dish and ate all meals for free.

892
01:10:55,112 --> 01:10:59,432
You will have to pay the hotel bill,
and return the money you stole

893
01:10:59,751 --> 01:11:01,872
We'll do that

894
01:11:02,205 --> 01:11:07,672
All right, but you'll have to continue
with this act for one more day

895
01:11:07,968 --> 01:11:11,792
Or the management
will skin you alive

896
01:11:11,872 --> 01:11:18,512
The hotel has organized a
party for my welcome tonight

897
01:11:18,955 --> 01:11:23,860
You will have to wear all
your real jewellery ....

898
01:11:24,228 --> 01:11:28,675
pose as my wife,
and be present at the party

899
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:29,955
I agree

900
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:39,275
Welcome, King

901
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:46,213
Please welcome the
King and Queen of Janakpur

902
01:11:46,533 --> 01:11:49,413
Glory to the King of Janakpur!

903
01:11:49,613 --> 01:11:58,216
Glory to the Queen of Janakpur!
Glory to the King of Janakpur!

904
01:11:59,533 --> 01:12:01,213
The King is pleased

905
01:12:01,493 --> 01:12:05,213
Queen, present a pearl necklace
to this man

906
01:12:05,686 --> 01:12:09,333
What?
- Gift your pearl necklace to him.

907
01:12:10,213 --> 01:12:10,973
No

908
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:16,853
Good

909
01:12:19,156 --> 01:12:20,013
Come

910
01:12:38,662 --> 01:12:43,245
What is your name, lady?
- Maria. I work in the casino

911
01:12:44,337 --> 01:12:45,883
The King is pleased

912
01:12:45,963 --> 01:12:50,173
Queen, gift her
your diamond necklace

913
01:12:50,693 --> 01:12:53,173
But King, it's very expensive

914
01:12:53,927 --> 01:12:56,619
But not more expensive
than my word, Queen

915
01:13:02,251 --> 01:13:05,773
I am proud of you, Queen.
Come

916
01:13:06,533 --> 01:13:08,613
Welcome, Queen

917
01:13:11,539 --> 01:13:16,512
Falling on some strange man is
against the glory of our royal family

918
01:13:16,653 --> 01:13:21,013
The King is annoyed
- Had you done this in the kingdom...

919
01:13:21,253 --> 01:13:24,093
I'd order you to be crushed
under elephant feet

920
01:13:24,293 --> 01:13:26,173
Should I call for an elephant?
- No...

921
01:13:26,253 --> 01:13:29,253
Then apologise to him
and give him a reward

922
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:34,933
I'm sorry, please forgive me.
I slipped and fell

923
01:13:46,783 --> 01:13:48,686
The King is pleased

924
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:53,735
Queen, give them a gift.
- Your Highness, I have nothing left

925
01:13:53,815 --> 01:13:58,373
You have those rings.
Distribute it among them

926
01:14:02,221 --> 01:14:04,941
They won't come off, King.
- Shall I chop off her fingers, King?

927
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:06,701
No, they came off

928
01:14:11,336 --> 01:14:16,319
Glory to the King of Janakpur!

929
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:18,461
Damn the King!

930
01:14:19,192 --> 01:14:21,552
All the money we had made in
10 years looting people...

931
01:14:21,872 --> 01:14:23,592
he made me lose it
all in 10 minutes

932
01:14:23,752 --> 01:14:27,112
Doesn't matter. Thank our stars
we didn't have to go to jail.

933
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:33,192
King, after being looted,
the Queen's gait has changed

934
01:14:35,216 --> 01:14:39,227
You are leaving, Queen?
- Yes, we'll have to go

935
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:43,606
What about the apology letter we
told you to write to the manager...

936
01:14:43,686 --> 01:14:45,952
regarding Gulshan?
- Here, take

937
01:14:47,444 --> 01:14:52,655
Queen, your neck doesn't look
good without any jewellery

938
01:14:52,735 --> 01:14:55,992
Take, wear my necklace

939
01:14:57,238 --> 01:15:02,244
A fake necklace for the
fake Queen from the fake King

940
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:08,557
What!... Who are you people?
- Students of this institute

941
01:15:08,855 --> 01:15:11,919
We played this
drama to teach you a lesson

942
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:16,082
Because every man
always has a one-up above him

943
01:15:35,002 --> 01:15:40,762
Today, our that's,
that has happened.

944
01:15:43,537 --> 01:15:48,337
One more year of our hotel management
institute's training has ended.

945
01:15:48,657 --> 01:15:55,377
Right. And for the first time,
this has happened.

946
01:15:56,127 --> 01:16:00,462
For the first time, two
students have scored equal marks

947
01:16:00,646 --> 01:16:03,657
Their names are Chantu and Bantu

948
01:16:17,361 --> 01:16:20,161
Both these young men
are our country's future.

949
01:16:20,624 --> 01:16:23,041
Wherever they go,
they will always succeed.

950
01:16:23,401 --> 01:16:26,201
Whichever hotel they work for,
they'll take that hotel...

951
01:16:26,361 --> 01:16:29,081
..to new heights of success.

952
01:16:33,683 --> 01:16:37,759
Daddy, please give consent, please!

953
01:16:37,839 --> 01:16:42,001
No! Didn't you find
anyone else to do that?

954
01:16:42,191 --> 01:16:44,310
Didn't you find anyone else
to fall in love with?

955
01:16:44,505 --> 01:16:49,154
Chantu and Bantu! Their
names also are so middle class

956
01:16:49,327 --> 01:16:51,574
Daddy, no one cares for class here

957
01:16:52,014 --> 01:16:55,814
But dear, I will find
grooms for you...

958
01:16:55,974 --> 01:16:59,727
...who, even after being reprimanded
by you, will run our resort well.

959
01:16:59,997 --> 01:17:04,734
Daddy, you only praised
them to the hilt yesterday.

960
01:17:05,284 --> 01:17:10,645
Haven't you heard the phrase? One
has a different facet for the public.

961
01:17:11,402 --> 01:17:17,542
What we did yesterday was that.
- That was our public facet.

962
01:17:17,622 --> 01:17:22,602
All right, then get this clear.
We will elope and marry them.

963
01:17:22,755 --> 01:17:26,656
You will be disgraced.
- People will spit at you.

964
01:17:27,185 --> 01:17:29,715
You will lose face.

965
01:17:31,109 --> 01:17:34,155
Khurana, that's a
horrible picture she's showing.

966
01:17:34,915 --> 01:17:38,082
We'll have to take the help of that.
- Of goons?

967
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:40,835
Brains.

968
01:17:41,271 --> 01:17:43,995
I have realized.

969
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:48,114
Look dear, ask Chantu & Bantu
to come and meet us.

970
01:17:50,687 --> 01:17:53,292
We'll ask them
to come and meet you.

971
01:17:56,612 --> 01:18:00,027
What have you done?
- I'll tell you

972
01:18:01,378 --> 01:18:03,056
Just let them come to meet us

973
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:06,239
I will play a trick which
will make them say...

974
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:08,616
...they don't want to
marry our daughters.

975
01:18:08,696 --> 01:18:10,038
How is that?

976
01:18:14,946 --> 01:18:19,839
Wow! What a great that.
- Isn't it a great idea?

977
01:18:19,919 --> 01:18:26,131
Let Chantu and Bantu come.
And watch the fun!

978
01:18:27,162 --> 01:18:28,405
What happened?

979
01:18:30,185 --> 01:18:31,745
Nothing! Nothing at all!

980
01:18:32,405 --> 01:18:34,785
We have scrounged all the hotels
in Goa in the last 15 days

981
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:37,625
Despite being gold medalists,
forget as a manager...

982
01:18:37,951 --> 01:18:39,705
no one is ready to
appoint us even as waiters

983
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:43,305
They are all demanding bribes
of 25,000 and 50,000

984
01:18:43,788 --> 01:18:47,425
Only a local joint remains now,
should we try there?

985
01:18:47,505 --> 01:18:49,853
Don't joke. We don't even
have any money left now.

986
01:18:50,097 --> 01:18:53,377
We'll have to spend the night eating
grams, and return home tomorrow

987
01:18:53,577 --> 01:18:56,337
How can we go home like that?
How will we face Sundri and Mundri?

988
01:18:56,869 --> 01:19:01,204
We'll have to do something. Hey!
There is one financier in this city...

989
01:19:01,284 --> 01:19:04,617
who can give us some money.
- Who?

990
01:19:16,556 --> 01:19:22,604
Chantu! You scored excellent marks.
What more do you want in life?

991
01:19:22,771 --> 01:19:24,244
It's all by your grace.

992
01:19:25,684 --> 01:19:28,324
Sir, a sweet little girl
wants to meet you, sir

993
01:19:28,544 --> 01:19:32,684
Girl? She wants admission?
- I don't know

994
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:34,484
Call her in.
- Yes sir

995
01:19:35,084 --> 01:19:36,084
Come in, sister

996
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:49,323
What are you doing here?
- Where else can I go?

997
01:19:49,403 --> 01:19:54,250
Keep your hands away! What's this?
- A baby. A gift from you

998
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:57,890
I gave you my purse, my chain,
not this

999
01:19:57,970 --> 01:19:59,730
Now you don't stare at me,
tell her!

1000
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:03,650
How do I know, sir?
I entered after the climax

1001
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:06,650
There was nothing in the movie
except the climax

1002
01:20:08,004 --> 01:20:10,450
I will stay here.
I won't go anywhere!

1003
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:15,130
Sir, such women cannot be trusted

1004
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,450
Pay her Rs.50-60 thousand
and send her away

1005
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:21,250
All right. 50-60...?
- Pay her a lakh or two

1006
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:24,250
A lakh or two! Get out of here!
Get out of my sight!

1007
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:27,690
And you unchaste woman!
Just get out of my sight!

1008
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:31,330
Then who will support this baby?

1009
01:20:36,739 --> 01:20:39,059
Such a big deception,
you cheap woman!

1010
01:20:40,579 --> 01:20:42,899
Let's go!
- Where are you going!

1011
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:46,219
Bantu, you!
- Is my hair okay, sir?

1012
01:20:46,339 --> 01:20:48,819
I won't spare you two!
Where is my revolver?

1013
01:20:54,419 --> 01:20:58,339
I won't spare them!
I will take revenge!

1014
01:20:58,568 --> 01:21:02,547
What! Khanna and Khurana want
to meet us? To discuss marriage?

1015
01:21:02,787 --> 01:21:05,627
Yes. We have been looking for
you since the past four days

1016
01:21:05,907 --> 01:21:09,307
And you are eating bhelpuri over here.
- We've made it!

1017
01:21:09,387 --> 01:21:10,827
Yes.
- This is not the time to joke

1018
01:22:42,827 --> 01:22:45,187
Our whole future is
dependent on this meeting

1019
01:22:45,368 --> 01:22:48,267
Yes, she's right.
We'll know after this meeting...

1020
01:22:48,347 --> 01:22:50,867
whether we'll live in a
shanty or a mansion

1021
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:52,987
Whether our children will study
in a good school and eat burgers...

1022
01:22:53,206 --> 01:22:54,787
or street snacks
outside a municipal school.

1023
01:22:55,703 --> 01:22:57,732
Is this meeting so serious?

1024
01:22:57,812 --> 01:23:00,412
Yes. We'll have to make
this meeting click so well...

1025
01:23:00,492 --> 01:23:01,892
that it sets our lives

1026
01:23:05,908 --> 01:23:07,396
What will your father ask?

1027
01:23:07,794 --> 01:23:12,342
What do you have which will make
us give you our daughters in marriage?

1028
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:16,460
We have everything. Two legs, two
hands, two ears, two eyes, and one...

1029
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:18,154
Enough!
- Nose, sir

1030
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:21,470
Don't go further.
An ass has four of those

1031
01:23:21,838 --> 01:23:24,670
That doesn't mean we get
our daughters that with them

1032
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,950
Get our daughters married to them.

1033
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:31,206
When life shows that, even
the tough show that and run away

1034
01:23:31,286 --> 01:23:34,354
What do they show, sir?
- When life becomes a challenge...

1035
01:23:34,434 --> 01:23:36,914
even the tough show
their backs and run away

1036
01:23:37,104 --> 01:23:40,443
We are ready to
face any challenge, sir

1037
01:23:40,908 --> 01:23:42,468
Think again

1038
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:45,508
Had he been thinking,
he'd not have had the brawn

1039
01:23:45,823 --> 01:23:48,388
But now that he has,
we accept the challenge

1040
01:23:49,481 --> 01:23:53,045
Shall I tell them? We have a that
that's of no use

1041
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:56,668
What are you saying, sir!
- He's talking of our health resort

1042
01:23:57,299 --> 01:23:59,990
A local goon has shut it down

1043
01:24:00,266 --> 01:24:04,868
If you can restart that resort and
run it for at least a year...

1044
01:24:04,948 --> 01:24:08,508
...only then can we think of
accepting you as our sons-in-law.

1045
01:24:09,486 --> 01:24:12,980
Until then, you two will
not meet our daughters.

1046
01:24:17,604 --> 01:24:20,364
Look daddy, if you disapprove
of our marriage, just say so

1047
01:24:20,859 --> 01:24:24,284
At least don't conspire to get
our love killed by those goons

1048
01:24:24,364 --> 01:24:27,204
But they said they are
ready to accept any challenge.

1049
01:24:27,545 --> 01:24:30,524
Yes, but they didn't know
you will push them to their death

1050
01:24:30,604 --> 01:24:35,284
A challenge can be anything.
- The challenged must have that

1051
01:24:35,622 --> 01:24:36,686
Courage

1052
01:24:36,876 --> 01:24:41,295
Sir, we have so much courage,
no challenge can confront us

1053
01:24:41,477 --> 01:24:43,665
Is it?
- Did I speak too much?

1054
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:48,767
We will not only restart your resort,
but get it repaired by the one...

1055
01:24:48,847 --> 01:24:50,604
who damaged it

1056
01:24:51,842 --> 01:24:54,882
Did you hear that?
- They are going to die!

1057
01:24:55,515 --> 01:24:58,842
If that happens,
you can meet our daughters

1058
01:25:01,371 --> 01:25:04,313
What have you done!
- We have to jump in the fray now

1059
01:25:04,598 --> 01:25:07,242
Father-in-law, make arrangements
for the marriage

1060
01:25:12,884 --> 01:25:16,004
Peter, two very rich guests
have come to our hotel today

1061
01:25:16,084 --> 01:25:18,164
Cook very tasty food for them

1062
01:25:19,525 --> 01:25:21,364
Are you the owner of this hotel?
- Yes.

1063
01:25:21,523 --> 01:25:23,997
This is a very bad hotel.
You loot people

1064
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:27,644
What nonsense are you talking?
- I'd ordered a tandoori chicken

1065
01:25:27,984 --> 01:25:30,821
You took full money,
but the chicken had only one leg

1066
01:25:30,901 --> 01:25:33,960
So?
- Do chickens have only one leg?

1067
01:25:34,124 --> 01:25:35,324
Look.

1068
01:25:40,482 --> 01:25:41,563
Look

1069
01:25:41,728 --> 01:25:43,928
You should have whistled like that
at the tandoori chicken

1070
01:25:44,008 --> 01:25:46,088
Even she would remove her
other leg. Now get lost!

1071
01:25:47,505 --> 01:25:50,360
Sir, I showed them the entire
hotel, but they want to meet you

1072
01:25:50,533 --> 01:25:51,848
Is it?
Where are they?

1073
01:25:52,868 --> 01:25:57,003
Good.
- Very pretty.

1074
01:25:59,978 --> 01:26:02,487
Your hotel is great

1075
01:26:02,567 --> 01:26:05,739
Our Sultan wants to come
to such a place for a holiday

1076
01:26:05,819 --> 01:26:11,014
Rafiq, tell me, can you make this
hotel available to us for a month?

1077
01:26:11,094 --> 01:26:14,396
What! The entire hotel for a month?
- Yes

1078
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,313
For the Sultan's
20 wives and his slaves

1079
01:26:18,457 --> 01:26:20,817
20 wives!
- He takes them along everywhere

1080
01:26:21,012 --> 01:26:23,257
And he has another 30 in his harem.
- That means, 50!

1081
01:26:23,337 --> 01:26:26,497
He will marry another 10 next year.
- 60!

1082
01:26:26,711 --> 01:26:30,914
Just tell me whether you can
book the hotel for us or not

1083
01:26:30,994 --> 01:26:34,374
Of course I can. The rent
of each room will be 5000

1084
01:26:34,454 --> 01:26:38,896
What nonsense!
We cannot pay you more than $4000

1085
01:26:38,976 --> 01:26:42,217
What!!
I was thinking of Rs 5000

1086
01:26:42,849 --> 01:26:47,155
He's talking of $4000, which is
Rs 200,000 rent per room!

1087
01:26:47,328 --> 01:26:51,064
We give that much
even in Europe and America

1088
01:26:51,144 --> 01:26:54,187
Since you are giving me such a
big contract, even I'll compromise

1089
01:26:54,267 --> 01:26:59,315
Then we will also pay you
an advance $500,000 next Friday

1090
01:26:59,551 --> 01:27:03,351
But we want the hotel's toilets,
lobby, everything in perfect shape

1091
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:07,005
Don't worry about that.
I'll renovate the entire hotel

1092
01:27:07,085 --> 01:27:13,500
Damn! Whose tomb is that near
the hotel?

1093
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:18,240
That! That's no tomb,
it's a resort in ruins

1094
01:27:18,447 --> 01:27:21,648
It looks like a graveyard.
The Sultan cannot stay here

1095
01:27:21,728 --> 01:27:26,811
The Sultan wants beautiful
surroundings all around him

1096
01:27:27,027 --> 01:27:29,933
Do you know, one of the Sultan's
wives had a pimple on her face

1097
01:27:30,130 --> 01:27:32,650
He got plastic surgery
done to her entire face

1098
01:27:32,730 --> 01:27:35,010
Rafiq, the contract
stands canceled!

1099
01:27:35,822 --> 01:27:38,250
Hey no! Listen to me!

1100
01:27:38,893 --> 01:27:46,010
I will get that resort repaired.
- You will the it repaired? Why?

1101
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:50,010
I only had got it damaged.
- You got it damaged?

1102
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:53,610
No, actually, my elder
brother was involved in it

1103
01:27:53,812 --> 01:27:56,890
Where is that brother of yours?
- He's in jail now

1104
01:27:57,167 --> 01:27:59,410
He slapped the ACP...

1105
01:27:59,822 --> 01:28:04,170
Forget all that. I'll have the resort
in spick span shape within a week

1106
01:28:04,388 --> 01:28:08,410
All right, then we will also
pay you an advance after a week

1107
01:28:08,645 --> 01:28:10,490
Good day!
- Son-of-a-gun!

1108
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:13,770
Good day!
Right away!

1109
01:28:34,137 --> 01:28:38,417
Great! Wonderful!

1110
01:28:38,497 --> 01:28:40,897
You have done a great job!

1111
01:28:41,129 --> 01:28:45,697
That roof there has
an empty look.

1112
01:28:46,257 --> 01:28:51,817
Fix the glass chandelier
in your hotel over here.

1113
01:28:52,097 --> 01:28:55,617
Then won't my hotel roof look bad?
- Don't worry about that.

1114
01:28:55,977 --> 01:28:59,817
We fit a diamond chandelier
wherever the Sultan stays.

1115
01:29:00,137 --> 01:29:02,537
What! A diamond chandelier?

1116
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:06,657
First fix the hotel chandelier there.
Do you know the rate of diamonds?

1117
01:29:11,217 --> 01:29:17,081
Even this door doesn't look good.
Put a good show piece here

1118
01:29:17,161 --> 01:29:21,093
I'll have 3-4 show pieces put here.
- Good! You are working so hard.

1119
01:29:21,417 --> 01:29:23,777
The Sultan will
gift you an oil well.

1120
01:29:23,948 --> 01:29:27,097
Oil well!
I'll fry fritters in them.

1121
01:29:27,817 --> 01:29:30,657
And the advance?
- You'll get it on Friday night.

1122
01:29:30,849 --> 01:29:33,137
Let's go, brother.
- Thank you, sir.

1123
01:29:35,433 --> 01:29:37,777
Live in style!

1124
01:29:41,738 --> 01:29:43,458
Excuse me, sir...
- What is it?

1125
01:29:43,925 --> 01:29:46,858
I've done a hotel management
course. I'm looking for a job.

1126
01:29:46,938 --> 01:29:49,618
No vacancy here.
- Sir, I'm a gold medalist.

1127
01:29:50,057 --> 01:29:51,951
And I was a gold smuggler.
So?

1128
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:55,187
Secretary! Call up my lawyer.

1129
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:01,970
Secretary! Call up my lawyer.
- Yes, madam.

1130
01:30:02,050 --> 01:30:04,290
Madam, why call a lawyer?

1131
01:30:04,370 --> 01:30:07,450
A conspiracy is being hatched
in this hotel to kill me.

1132
01:30:07,530 --> 01:30:10,001
Glass pieces have
been put in my ice-cream.

1133
01:30:10,081 --> 01:30:13,461
It must be a mistake, madam.
I'll have the ice-cream replaced.

1134
01:30:13,541 --> 01:30:16,669
And we'll provide you a meal,
all for no-charge.

1135
01:30:16,749 --> 01:30:20,742
Is he a manager or a damager?

1136
01:30:21,423 --> 01:30:24,463
I mean, don't mind,
that way, he'll have you ruined.

1137
01:30:25,023 --> 01:30:27,503
He's doing the right thing.
If she sues us...

1138
01:30:27,583 --> 01:30:29,703
...my hotel will have to be sold,
and even my home.

1139
01:30:29,823 --> 01:30:33,903
What right? Don't mind,
but each one has his own style.

1140
01:30:34,183 --> 01:30:38,023
If I was in his place, the Queen would
pay the bill and also leave a tip.

1141
01:30:39,663 --> 01:30:42,903
Is it?
If you are successful...

1142
01:30:43,195 --> 01:30:46,303
I will kick him out
and appoint you as manager.

1143
01:30:46,383 --> 01:30:47,903
Promise?
- Promise!

1144
01:30:51,377 --> 01:30:52,908
Don't do that, please.

1145
01:30:55,424 --> 01:30:57,145
You!
- I know her.

1146
01:30:57,370 --> 01:30:58,944
I'll convince her, you leave.

1147
01:31:02,663 --> 01:31:06,223
What are you doing here?
- The King will follow the Queen.

1148
01:31:06,979 --> 01:31:09,103
Want to call the police?
I'll call them.

1149
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:11,583
We'll even show them the
pieces of glass in your purse.

1150
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:15,383
Abadabada?
What language is that?

1151
01:31:17,391 --> 01:31:20,503
Why are you after us?
- Why do you come before me?

1152
01:31:20,955 --> 01:31:25,983
I will let you off if you pay
the bill, give a decent tip...

1153
01:31:26,063 --> 01:31:27,743
...and leave with a smile.

1154
01:31:29,932 --> 01:31:30,943
I will.

1155
01:31:33,789 --> 01:31:36,783
You also leave.
- We'll have to teach him a lesson.

1156
01:31:38,763 --> 01:31:42,126
You are great!
You are wonderful.

1157
01:31:42,484 --> 01:31:44,283
What did you tell them?
- Don't ask me that.

1158
01:31:44,523 --> 01:31:48,043
Sir, whether a king or his subjects,
I treat everyone like that.

1159
01:31:49,091 --> 01:31:51,403
I appoint you manager
of this hotel from today.

1160
01:31:51,483 --> 01:31:52,723
And me?
- Dismissed.

1161
01:31:52,923 --> 01:31:56,283
No sir, I don't want to
render him jobless.

1162
01:31:56,443 --> 01:31:57,923
Give him some other position.

1163
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:01,203
I appoint you
laundry manager.

1164
01:32:11,378 --> 01:32:14,658
See! They have started this,
ours that will close

1165
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:17,618
Their hotel started,
which will render us speechless

1166
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:19,418
We have even lost that

1167
01:32:19,568 --> 01:32:21,618
What?
- The girls!

1168
01:32:23,036 --> 01:32:26,138
Father-in-law, we did it.
Remember your deal?

1169
01:32:26,418 --> 01:32:27,378
Deal?

1170
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:31,218
We can meet your
daughters now, can't we?

1171
01:32:31,571 --> 01:32:36,338
You know where you have
to send Sundri and Mundri?

1172
01:32:36,418 --> 01:32:37,410
Where?

1173
01:33:08,787 --> 01:33:11,104
"What are you doing?"

1174
01:33:12,385 --> 01:33:14,664
"I am loving you"

1175
01:33:15,723 --> 01:33:18,144
"But why?"

1176
01:33:19,442 --> 01:33:21,482
"Because my heart says so"

1177
01:33:23,002 --> 01:33:26,642
"Ask your heart to wait
at least until we are married"

1178
01:33:26,722 --> 01:33:29,962
"My heart doesn't listen,
it's revolting"

1179
01:33:30,042 --> 01:33:32,322
"What are you doing?"

1180
01:33:33,482 --> 01:33:35,842
"I'm going home"

1181
01:33:37,002 --> 01:33:39,282
"But why?"

1182
01:33:40,242 --> 01:33:42,722
"Because I'm getting late"

1183
01:33:44,242 --> 01:33:48,122
"Ask your heart,
at least wait until evening"

1184
01:33:48,202 --> 01:33:51,122
"But it's going to be night now"

1185
01:33:51,202 --> 01:33:53,522
"What are you doing?"

1186
01:33:54,894 --> 01:33:57,099
"I am loving you"

1187
01:33:58,294 --> 01:34:00,586
"But why?"

1188
01:34:02,004 --> 01:34:04,313
"Because my heart says so"

1189
01:34:20,088 --> 01:34:26,042
"For you, my darling,
I have waited four hours today"

1190
01:34:27,202 --> 01:34:30,402
"Show some kindness,
love me"

1191
01:34:30,722 --> 01:34:33,762
"Don't just leave me and go"

1192
01:34:34,203 --> 01:34:37,402
"I will stay,
but on one condition"

1193
01:34:37,723 --> 01:34:40,682
"You will take me to the disco"

1194
01:34:41,322 --> 01:34:44,522
"You will treat me to pizzas
at Pizza Hut"

1195
01:34:44,882 --> 01:34:47,682
"And take me around in a taxi"

1196
01:34:47,842 --> 01:34:51,722
"Why are you making me spend money,
why make me broke?"

1197
01:34:51,962 --> 01:34:54,962
"That is why I said good bye"

1198
01:34:55,042 --> 01:34:56,962
"What are you doing...?"

1199
01:34:58,723 --> 01:35:00,928
"I am loving you"

1200
01:35:02,096 --> 01:35:04,526
"But why?"

1201
01:35:05,815 --> 01:35:08,721
"Because my heart says so"

1202
01:35:33,586 --> 01:35:34,476
Come!

1203
01:35:37,936 --> 01:35:44,122
"When my father comes to know
I was with you all night"

1204
01:35:45,042 --> 01:35:48,202
"He will make me run out"

1205
01:35:48,669 --> 01:35:51,442
"And you will be clean bowled"

1206
01:35:52,241 --> 01:35:55,282
"That you are in love,
that you are desperate"

1207
01:35:55,727 --> 01:35:57,962
"Tell this to your father"

1208
01:35:59,255 --> 01:36:02,482
"Hit a six on the
first ball itself"

1209
01:36:02,948 --> 01:36:05,282
"Stop taking singles"

1210
01:36:05,932 --> 01:36:09,762
"How can I hit a six,
when my father is Shoaib Akhtar?"

1211
01:36:09,842 --> 01:36:12,842
"Confront your father
as Sachin Tendulkar!"

1212
01:36:12,922 --> 01:36:15,362
"What are you doing...?"

1213
01:36:16,718 --> 01:36:19,321
"I'm going home"

1214
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:22,963
"But why?"

1215
01:36:23,335 --> 01:36:25,877
"Because I'm getting late"

1216
01:36:49,013 --> 01:36:52,110
"In your love, my heart says"

1217
01:36:52,362 --> 01:36:54,602
"I am your hero number one"

1218
01:36:55,862 --> 01:36:59,082
"Don't tax me,
don't create a scene"

1219
01:36:59,529 --> 01:37:02,366
"Become my wife number one"

1220
01:37:03,032 --> 01:37:06,442
"O my love, O my Tarzan"

1221
01:37:06,665 --> 01:37:09,482
"I have a strange feeling"

1222
01:37:10,143 --> 01:37:13,322
"Listen my love,
my darling"

1223
01:37:13,715 --> 01:37:16,783
"My heart loves you"

1224
01:37:16,863 --> 01:37:20,821
"My heart is wounded,
it is naughty, mischievous"

1225
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:23,562
"I'm helpless,
my heart is crazy"

1226
01:37:23,642 --> 01:37:26,376
"What are you doing?"

1227
01:37:27,586 --> 01:37:29,682
"I am opening my purse"

1228
01:37:31,003 --> 01:37:33,322
"But why?"

1229
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:36,954
"I'm checking the money I have"

1230
01:37:38,021 --> 01:37:41,941
"This is a sad moment,
and you are worried about money"

1231
01:37:42,181 --> 01:37:45,421
"More than me, it's your eyes
that are fixed on my purse"

1232
01:37:52,141 --> 01:37:53,701
You!
- How was your date?

1233
01:37:53,852 --> 01:37:55,743
It was great!

1234
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:05,858
You have totally
changed my view!

1235
01:38:06,115 --> 01:38:09,098
My Sultan would be very happy
with you if he came here

1236
01:38:09,339 --> 01:38:12,938
If your Sultan comes here once...
she'll keep coming, you see

1237
01:38:14,626 --> 01:38:18,618
I've seen you somewhere, Prince!
- Not me, sir

1238
01:38:18,791 --> 01:38:21,698
If you could step aside for
a moment, sir... one moment

1239
01:38:23,426 --> 01:38:26,217
Is the Sultan of Bukhara coming?
- Yes.

1240
01:38:26,297 --> 01:38:28,978
So here's my resignation

1241
01:38:29,239 --> 01:38:31,827
Why?
- This Sultan is Satan, sir

1242
01:38:32,207 --> 01:38:34,331
What rubbish!
- He's a crazy philanderer!

1243
01:38:34,954 --> 01:38:37,306
Yes, sir. He comes with
his slaves and twenty wives

1244
01:38:37,673 --> 01:38:40,956
When I was in Malaysia, one of the
owners of the hotel happened to...

1245
01:38:41,036 --> 01:38:45,596
gaze his wife number 13 by mistake.
The Sultan gorged out his eyes!

1246
01:38:45,977 --> 01:38:49,058
What?
- Yes, sir. Last year in Jakarta...

1247
01:38:49,236 --> 01:38:51,098
the Sultan was served a cold soup

1248
01:38:51,178 --> 01:38:53,818
He had the owner thrown
in boiling oil!

1249
01:38:56,058 --> 01:38:58,520
I don't believe it!
- Don't! Experience it!

1250
01:38:58,673 --> 01:39:01,498
He thrusts live kids into
the Bush Kashi game!

1251
01:39:02,489 --> 01:39:04,778
What's Bush Kashi...?
- You saw the movie "Khuda Gawah" ?

1252
01:39:04,858 --> 01:39:07,938
Yes, thrice.
- The pathans come on horses...

1253
01:39:10,012 --> 01:39:12,378
and carry a dead goat
with a spear

1254
01:39:13,101 --> 01:39:15,021
He carries live kids!

1255
01:39:15,697 --> 01:39:19,931
He owns the bloody place...?
- He does! He owns oil wells

1256
01:39:20,052 --> 01:39:22,972
He gifts oil wells to every Prime
Minister whose country he visits

1257
01:39:23,052 --> 01:39:26,212
So what law and order...?
Here's my resignation

1258
01:39:26,363 --> 01:39:29,012
Let him gorge your eyes out,
fry you in the oil...

1259
01:39:29,092 --> 01:39:32,092
or play Bush Kashi with your kids!
I don't want this job

1260
01:39:32,258 --> 01:39:34,892
I also want to live!
I don't want a customer like him!

1261
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:36,692
No Bush Kashi!

1262
01:39:36,772 --> 01:39:39,332
How won't you give me a booking?

1263
01:39:39,412 --> 01:39:42,132
The Sheikh will arrive and play
Bush Kashi with you!

1264
01:39:42,277 --> 01:39:46,263
Before that, I'll shoot you!
- Sir... what are you doing?

1265
01:39:46,343 --> 01:39:49,052
If you interfere, I'm going
to shoot you too!

1266
01:39:49,132 --> 01:39:52,572
I'm not sparing you!
Come on out!

1267
01:39:52,729 --> 01:39:56,332
See? Such a dangerous tailor! Guess
how dangerous the Sultan will be!

1268
01:39:56,503 --> 01:39:59,802
Coward! Come on out...
don't hide!

1269
01:39:59,996 --> 01:40:01,876
Either take a bullet
or giving me a booking!

1270
01:40:02,448 --> 01:40:05,476
Get rid of him, please!
- Do you have some money?

1271
01:40:05,892 --> 01:40:08,154
Money? How much?
- 40 or 50 grand...

1272
01:40:08,234 --> 01:40:10,636
we must get him to shut up!
- 50,000 ?

1273
01:40:10,716 --> 01:40:12,756
If we live, we'll make much more!

1274
01:40:13,475 --> 01:40:17,036
Step out, coward! Either I get
a booking or you bite a bullet!

1275
01:40:19,613 --> 01:40:21,516
Want me to come out...?
- Yes!

1276
01:40:22,702 --> 01:40:26,770
Sultan... keep this!
- No, I don't accept bribes!

1277
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:29,588
I want a booking!
- But this is a gift, Sultan!

1278
01:40:29,668 --> 01:40:32,956
I want a booking...
- Keep this, please. Please!

1279
01:40:34,879 --> 01:40:39,757
Scoundrel! If it wasn't for
this kid, I'd have shot you today!

1280
01:40:44,451 --> 01:40:46,311
He has left

1281
01:40:46,533 --> 01:40:49,436
Thanks, you've saved my life!

1282
01:40:50,635 --> 01:40:54,593
I'll never forget this favour.
Keep this. For you

1283
01:40:54,792 --> 01:40:55,783
How about a soft drink?

1284
01:40:57,994 --> 01:41:01,514
The hotel we broke up,
they've started it again!

1285
01:41:01,718 --> 01:41:04,761
We must raze it to the ground!
- What are you doing, Sayba?

1286
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:08,370
You want to join your brother
in jail? Use your brains

1287
01:41:09,025 --> 01:41:11,994
Using brains isn't my job!
- Never mind

1288
01:41:12,332 --> 01:41:14,052
When will my brains help?

1289
01:41:14,959 --> 01:41:16,668
"Goa's best hotel"

1290
01:41:23,062 --> 01:41:24,391
This is great, isn't it...?

1291
01:41:30,741 --> 01:41:32,259
"India's best hotel"

1292
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:49,903
"Asia's best hotel"
- Take that!

1293
01:41:56,007 --> 01:41:57,551
"The best resort in the world"

1294
01:42:04,904 --> 01:42:07,024
It's okay. I'll fix him.

1295
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:09,744
Damn you!

1296
01:42:10,482 --> 01:42:12,224
"The best resort in this lane"

1297
01:42:21,962 --> 01:42:25,074
Go ahead, feller...
Put up another board!

1298
01:42:26,096 --> 01:42:27,336
You're acting smart, are you?

1299
01:42:27,536 --> 01:42:30,576
One blow and you'll
sleep forever!

1300
01:42:30,696 --> 01:42:33,896
Get lost, langur!
- I can see that!

1301
01:42:34,136 --> 01:42:37,296
Smartass, what blow will you give?

1302
01:42:40,074 --> 01:42:42,703
See this?
- Don't show off your muscles!

1303
01:42:42,783 --> 01:42:48,416
Look at his paunch! Your
hot muscles will turn into ice!

1304
01:42:48,496 --> 01:42:51,616
Oh, get lost.
- What get lost? Try it out

1305
01:42:51,974 --> 01:42:56,696
Sayba, thrust your paunch ahead.
Without a fear! Go ahead!

1306
01:42:58,312 --> 01:43:01,444
Look at the smile! The smile!

1307
01:43:01,524 --> 01:43:04,256
What are you grinning for...?
I'll knock all your teeth out!

1308
01:43:04,336 --> 01:43:08,031
His teeth are so strong,
your fist can't knock them out!

1309
01:43:08,111 --> 01:43:09,176
One moment!

1310
01:43:11,744 --> 01:43:16,384
You saved him the dentist's fee!
He had to get them out anyway!

1311
01:43:17,224 --> 01:43:21,784
My boss has the brains!
- Now I'll smash his brains

1312
01:43:21,958 --> 01:43:25,344
You'll break your hand!
It's a helmet, not just a head

1313
01:43:25,424 --> 01:43:27,744
Just try! Thrust your head here, sir.
- No, it's okay

1314
01:43:27,824 --> 01:43:30,144
Sayba, we'll have to
put him in his place!

1315
01:43:30,224 --> 01:43:33,504
You're going to put me in my place?
One moment

1316
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:51,970
At 300 rupees?

1317
01:43:52,210 --> 01:43:54,963
What's that? It's 600 here
and 300 there...?

1318
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:57,370
Let's go there. C'mon

1319
01:43:57,542 --> 01:43:59,534
Hey! They're all going there!

1320
01:43:59,622 --> 01:44:03,222
Yes, he's selling lunch at 300.
Let's go and wreck his place!

1321
01:44:03,675 --> 01:44:05,662
Hang on... he has a heavy hand

1322
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:09,287
What about all the food we have?
- It'll be a huge loss

1323
01:44:09,653 --> 01:44:13,212
Listen, I can save your losses.
- You?

1324
01:44:13,535 --> 01:44:17,575
Yes, I. We have a lot of
guests at our hotel suddenly

1325
01:44:17,812 --> 01:44:19,375
We haven't cooked so much

1326
01:44:19,755 --> 01:44:22,655
But you must have a lot of food.
Isn't it?

1327
01:44:23,055 --> 01:44:24,255
All because of you!

1328
01:44:26,335 --> 01:44:29,295
Want to sell it at 200 per plate?
- You think I'm a fool?

1329
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:33,855
You'll sell our food to our customers
and make 100 bucks on each plate?

1330
01:44:34,299 --> 01:44:37,503
Give it away, sir. Even if it's
200 bucks, it's still coming in!

1331
01:44:37,583 --> 01:44:40,913
The dogs won't pay you any money.
Give it away to him!

1332
01:44:40,993 --> 01:44:44,735
Won't that be a humiliation?
- No way

1333
01:44:44,815 --> 01:44:48,414
Hey wrestler... we aren't
out to make money

1334
01:44:48,642 --> 01:44:51,442
We're only helping you because
you've come to us!

1335
01:44:51,602 --> 01:44:53,882
Take the food away!
You'll remember...

1336
01:44:53,962 --> 01:44:56,242
you had a large-hearted adversary!

1337
01:44:57,071 --> 01:44:58,082
Take it away

1338
01:45:00,804 --> 01:45:02,924
What happened then?
- What else?

1339
01:45:03,164 --> 01:45:07,830
We sold his food to him and made
a profit of 100 per plate!

1340
01:45:08,771 --> 01:45:11,600
At this rate, his hotel
will close down

1341
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:15,517
No, that's not happening.
What we make in a week...

1342
01:45:15,718 --> 01:45:17,837
his hotel makes on a
single Saturday night

1343
01:45:18,038 --> 01:45:21,197
How come?
- He has a cabaret every Saturday night

1344
01:45:22,195 --> 01:45:24,917
You work in a place like that?
Give up the job immediately

1345
01:45:24,997 --> 01:45:27,917
Silly girl. On Saturday nights,
I shut my eyes and work

1346
01:45:29,473 --> 01:45:33,517
We must have the cabaret stopped.
It's against the law!

1347
01:45:33,597 --> 01:45:36,477
He has a setting right to
the top...

1348
01:45:36,763 --> 01:45:41,117
want me set your top?
- No, but we'll have to find a way

1349
01:45:41,477 --> 01:45:44,877
It's ages since we used
formula 36, 24 and 36

1350
01:45:45,182 --> 01:45:47,717
What's that?
- 36, 24, 36

1351
01:45:57,001 --> 01:45:58,441
Let's stop the dance

1352
01:45:59,801 --> 01:46:02,721
Rubbish! That's what
the hotel is running on

1353
01:46:02,921 --> 01:46:04,401
If we stop that,
what do we earn?

1354
01:46:04,721 --> 01:46:08,001
I'm asking you to stop the dance
only on Saturday nights

1355
01:46:08,174 --> 01:46:11,201
So it shuts the rival's hotel forever.
- How?

1356
01:46:11,281 --> 01:46:14,241
We won't have a dance in our hotel

1357
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:17,641
We'll display a board of a dance
in the rival's hotel

1358
01:46:18,055 --> 01:46:21,127
People from our hotel will go there,
but they won't have any dancers

1359
01:46:21,503 --> 01:46:25,787
People will get angry. And our guys
in the crowd will instigate the mob

1360
01:46:26,423 --> 01:46:28,870
It'll lead to arson!

1361
01:46:30,285 --> 01:46:33,565
Our job will be done,
without any effort! What say?

1362
01:46:36,635 --> 01:46:39,725
You have a fox's brains, I say!

1363
01:46:40,893 --> 01:46:43,445
You look like an owl
but you are hare-brained

1364
01:46:43,525 --> 01:46:45,326
You said something?
- No, sir. Beer

1365
01:46:48,501 --> 01:46:50,421
Watch it... careful

1366
01:46:55,946 --> 01:46:59,237
A dance at Blue Lagoon...?
Let's go. Must be new dancers

1367
01:47:19,458 --> 01:47:22,691
I can't understand how
there's a dance at this hotel

1368
01:47:29,521 --> 01:47:30,246
What happened?

1369
01:47:30,522 --> 01:47:34,148
The people are getting angry, Sayba.
The management will have a tough time

1370
01:47:36,424 --> 01:47:38,224
They don't have any dancers

1371
01:47:38,354 --> 01:47:44,704
So start the trouble. And break
down the whole hotel. The bastards!

1372
01:47:47,521 --> 01:47:49,126
Get the girl!

1373
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:51,019
Get started!

1374
01:47:51,821 --> 01:47:54,744
Beat him up!

1375
01:47:55,298 --> 01:47:58,840
Hit him!

1376
01:47:59,272 --> 01:48:01,741
Beat him up!

1377
01:48:01,918 --> 01:48:04,785
Hit him!

1378
01:48:04,865 --> 01:48:08,018
We want girls!
- Come down here!

1379
01:48:16,995 --> 01:48:19,835
"Excuse me..."

1380
01:48:20,710 --> 01:48:23,075
"excuse me, miss"

1381
01:48:24,407 --> 01:48:25,453
"Excuse me..."

1382
01:48:26,001 --> 01:48:27,175
"Excuse me..."

1383
01:48:28,105 --> 01:48:29,306
"Excuse me..."

1384
01:48:29,466 --> 01:48:30,933
"excuse me, miss"

1385
01:48:31,897 --> 01:48:35,129
"They all say to me,
excuse me, miss"

1386
01:48:35,489 --> 01:48:38,185
"Excuse me, miss...
give me a kiss"

1387
01:48:39,355 --> 01:48:42,915
"They all say to me,
excuse me, miss"

1388
01:48:43,075 --> 01:48:45,543
"Excuse me, miss...
give me a kiss"

1389
01:48:46,783 --> 01:48:50,154
"That's because my figure..."

1390
01:48:50,435 --> 01:48:53,795
"That's because my figure..."

1391
01:48:54,123 --> 01:48:57,075
"is 36, 24, 36"

1392
01:48:57,831 --> 01:49:01,014
"They all say to me,
excuse me, miss"

1393
01:49:01,284 --> 01:49:03,947
"Excuse me, miss...
give me a kiss"

1394
01:49:04,977 --> 01:49:07,362
"Excuse me..."

1395
01:49:08,663 --> 01:49:11,121
"excuse me, miss"

1396
01:49:19,684 --> 01:49:23,371
"So many of them
lost their hearts to me..."

1397
01:49:23,653 --> 01:49:27,355
"the whole of India
is crazy about me"

1398
01:49:30,755 --> 01:49:34,578
"Everywhere I go,
I'm surrounded by boys..."

1399
01:49:34,658 --> 01:49:38,155
"they say excuse me
and bore me no end"

1400
01:49:38,275 --> 01:49:41,755
"What happens,
my heart asks for more"

1401
01:49:41,835 --> 01:49:44,273
"Excuse me..."

1402
01:49:45,508 --> 01:49:47,799
"Excuse me, miss"

1403
01:50:11,555 --> 01:50:14,037
What rubbish! Where did
the dancers come from?

1404
01:50:14,923 --> 01:50:16,915
I don't know, Sayba.
But they look like newcomers

1405
01:50:17,441 --> 01:50:18,795
So screw up the newcomers!

1406
01:50:20,064 --> 01:50:23,706
Your plan, wasn't it? If it fails,
you're a gone case. Okay?

1407
01:50:24,126 --> 01:50:25,115
Go and do something!

1408
01:50:33,306 --> 01:50:37,023
"Listen, guys...
I lack nothing"

1409
01:50:37,307 --> 01:50:40,755
"No wonder everyone asks me...
will you marry me?"

1410
01:50:44,555 --> 01:50:48,195
"I have a colourful
youthfulness..."

1411
01:50:48,411 --> 01:50:51,929
"it's sweet and spicy"

1412
01:50:52,009 --> 01:50:55,355
"A look at me and they say,
wow! What a broad!"

1413
01:50:55,724 --> 01:50:58,464
"Excuse me..."

1414
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:01,737
"Excuse me, miss"

1415
01:51:03,162 --> 01:51:05,591
"Excuse me..."

1416
01:51:06,484 --> 01:51:09,272
"Excuse me, miss"

1417
01:51:10,393 --> 01:51:13,707
"They all say to me,
excuse me, miss"

1418
01:51:13,984 --> 01:51:16,488
"Excuse me, miss...
give me a kiss"

1419
01:51:17,783 --> 01:51:21,207
"That's because my figure..."

1420
01:51:21,595 --> 01:51:24,715
"That's because my figure..."

1421
01:51:25,296 --> 01:51:28,500
"is 54, 48, 56"

1422
01:51:37,881 --> 01:51:40,413
Who are you?
Let me go!

1423
01:51:48,031 --> 01:51:49,075
Nice arrangement.

1424
01:51:56,922 --> 01:52:00,278
Why have you guys stopped?
Keep playing the band

1425
01:52:00,769 --> 01:52:01,835
I'll play with them

1426
01:52:17,015 --> 01:52:18,177
Boss, you?
- What is this?

1427
01:52:18,454 --> 01:52:20,035
You want to kill him...?
Go ahead

1428
01:52:28,279 --> 01:52:29,875
What are you waiting for...?
Thrash him!

1429
01:52:38,422 --> 01:52:41,930
Baldie, you're hanging
on to a girl...? Go there!

1430
01:52:43,327 --> 01:52:45,161
Why're you shaking?
You got an itch...?

1431
01:52:45,776 --> 01:52:49,235
Look at your size and hers...
go and get him!

1432
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:02,340
Smartass! As if I get my hands
on you every day!

1433
01:53:02,624 --> 01:53:04,499
Show the temper there!

1434
01:53:09,535 --> 01:53:10,515
You're on their side!
- Oh yes

1435
01:53:38,932 --> 01:53:41,665
Don't you touch them!

1436
01:53:42,246 --> 01:53:44,467
Want me to leave fingerprints?
- Damn you!

1437
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,515
Take them to the hospital!

1438
01:54:03,474 --> 01:54:07,062
You bloody manager! I sent you
to wreck the hotel!

1439
01:54:07,142 --> 01:54:09,345
And you wrecked our own guys?
You want me to break you now?

1440
01:54:09,425 --> 01:54:11,047
Who told you?
- Who told me?

1441
01:54:11,127 --> 01:54:14,875
You hit Kallu so hard, he went
through the glass door!

1442
01:54:15,237 --> 01:54:17,973
You hit Sukhdev so hard,
he fell in the bar counter...

1443
01:54:18,053 --> 01:54:20,075
and everything fell on him!
- And?

1444
01:54:20,155 --> 01:54:23,867
You kicked Raju so hard,
he rammed into the cupboard...

1445
01:54:23,947 --> 01:54:26,515
and everything fell on him!
- So what do you gather?

1446
01:54:26,764 --> 01:54:30,696
What have I to gather?
- Your guys live off you

1447
01:54:30,776 --> 01:54:32,635
They'll recover in a couple of days

1448
01:54:32,859 --> 01:54:35,355
But think of the losses caused
to him in the arson and breakage

1449
01:54:35,502 --> 01:54:37,841
I've dealt him a blow of
at least a million and a half!

1450
01:54:38,034 --> 01:54:39,826
How can you say such things!

1451
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:45,435
Amazing guy! You make me profit
even in his losses! - Then.

1452
01:54:50,235 --> 01:54:54,675
Look at that! The place was
swarming with beautiful girls...

1453
01:54:54,881 --> 01:54:56,995
and it's as deserted as
a bald man's head today

1454
01:55:00,222 --> 01:55:03,795
"Goa's best hotel"
- Goa's biggest ruins!

1455
01:55:11,439 --> 01:55:14,155
Why's he laughing?

1456
01:55:14,316 --> 01:55:16,274
His ruin has driven him mad

1457
01:55:18,875 --> 01:55:22,155
Who're they...?
- Looks like the insurance guys

1458
01:55:22,792 --> 01:55:26,535
What happened?
- We have inspected the losses

1459
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:30,520
We'll have to pay at least
5 million as insurance cover

1460
01:55:30,707 --> 01:55:34,554
5 million! But he bought
the policy only a few days ago!

1461
01:55:35,502 --> 01:55:37,446
He had the place insured already

1462
01:55:37,859 --> 01:55:41,419
Can't help it, sir. I'll have to
put together a new disco altogether

1463
01:55:41,659 --> 01:55:44,641
I'll have to get the glass
from Belgium...

1464
01:55:44,807 --> 01:55:47,409
disco lights from America...

1465
01:55:47,548 --> 01:55:49,588
a quality sound system
from London...

1466
01:55:51,159 --> 01:55:53,459
See? He wants us to listen!

1467
01:55:53,927 --> 01:55:56,307
He wants us to be jealous, Sayba

1468
01:55:56,391 --> 01:55:58,991
All this will cost money.
Isn't it, sir?

1469
01:55:59,185 --> 01:56:02,951
But it will surely be
the number one disco! What say?

1470
01:56:03,412 --> 01:56:04,951
Let's go in, Sayba

1471
01:56:09,591 --> 01:56:13,517
Chantu, what will your
mummy and I do in Goa...

1472
01:56:13,597 --> 01:56:16,991
at this age, leaving behind this
house and everything here?

1473
01:56:17,154 --> 01:56:18,953
You've grown old, not me!

1474
01:56:19,343 --> 01:56:24,263
Piping hot tea every morning, dad!
Followed by a continental breakfast

1475
01:56:24,343 --> 01:56:26,184
And relaxation in a
luxurious room after that

1476
01:56:26,264 --> 01:56:30,004
After that, a small dip
in the swimming pool...

1477
01:56:30,142 --> 01:56:34,782
How will your mother get into the
swimming pool at her age, my son?

1478
01:56:34,862 --> 01:56:37,511
As if your mother will!
Give me the phone!

1479
01:56:37,591 --> 01:56:40,262
We'll send mummy shopping, dad

1480
01:56:40,804 --> 01:56:44,084
And the two of us will set out for
a healthy walk every evening

1481
01:56:44,724 --> 01:56:49,804
And I'll treat you to a couple of pegs
of the best whisky in the world

1482
01:56:50,244 --> 01:56:54,940
A couple of them is all right.
But they ought to be big ones

1483
01:56:55,078 --> 01:56:57,284
Oh yes, also tell him to
arrange for some crisps

1484
01:56:58,123 --> 01:56:59,779
Also the accompaniment, son.

1485
01:56:59,859 --> 01:57:04,060
We have worked hard
to make you feel proud of us, dad

1486
01:57:04,342 --> 01:57:08,142
Come and see for yourself, dad.
You'll have a lot of rest

1487
01:57:08,902 --> 01:57:12,182
And Dad, I forgot to tell you
the main thing

1488
01:57:12,502 --> 01:57:16,396
I have a surprise waiting for you!
- What surprise?

1489
01:57:16,589 --> 01:57:20,076
I'll tell you only when you
come here... yes, it's a surprise

1490
01:57:20,664 --> 01:57:23,224
Must hang up now. This call is
getting to be too expensive!

1491
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:28,275
He is my son.

1492
01:57:32,268 --> 01:57:34,859
What's up sir?
You're in a good mood

1493
01:57:35,019 --> 01:57:38,539
From night lamp to tube light.
- Since the punk started the hotel..

1494
01:57:38,619 --> 01:57:40,334
Business is down in the dumps

1495
01:57:40,472 --> 01:57:43,627
After many days I've got a
good tourist group coming

1496
01:57:44,984 --> 01:57:48,097
Wish I'd known earlier. I'd have
sent them to Chantu's hotel

1497
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:50,104
Did you say something?
- No. Who is coming?

1498
01:57:50,277 --> 01:57:53,833
Some folk attending
a college conference

1499
01:58:03,753 --> 01:58:06,233
Hurry up!
- Welcome to Goa

1500
01:58:10,273 --> 01:58:13,891
Welcome. Please come..

1501
01:58:15,607 --> 01:58:18,410
Holy shit! From where
did this imbecile come?

1502
01:58:21,175 --> 01:58:24,255
What are you doing here?
- He's the hotel manager

1503
01:58:24,335 --> 01:58:28,975
Do you know him?
- Do I? He studied in my college

1504
01:58:29,163 --> 01:58:32,754
Not studied... both of them
would give us lessons

1505
01:58:34,407 --> 01:58:40,695
Hey, listen. The guys whose tales
I narrated from Bombay to Goa...

1506
01:58:40,775 --> 01:58:43,223
Chantu and Bantu... This is Bantu..

1507
01:58:45,025 --> 01:58:47,505
Where is sly Chantu?

1508
01:58:47,665 --> 01:58:50,025
Sir, relax for a while.
We'll talk later

1509
01:58:50,105 --> 01:58:52,813
Is he also here?
- Who are you talking of?

1510
01:58:53,401 --> 01:58:57,595
He was a friend of mine.
- What? He never spoke of Chantu?

1511
01:58:57,675 --> 01:59:00,646
They were like peas in a pod.
- Really?

1512
01:59:00,726 --> 01:59:05,407
They can never break up.
They'd fool everyone

1513
01:59:05,766 --> 01:59:08,923
Sir, what are you saying?
- I'm praising you

1514
01:59:09,731 --> 01:59:13,066
They were masters.
They'll say, they're shaving...

1515
01:59:13,323 --> 01:59:15,923
They'll shave your head off
and you won't even realise

1516
01:59:16,366 --> 01:59:20,732
They make monkeys out of men.
- Sir, forget it. That's past

1517
01:59:20,905 --> 01:59:24,074
Yes but where is he?
- He's working elsewhere

1518
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:27,042
Why?
- There was only one post here

1519
01:59:27,194 --> 01:59:30,123
Then create a vacancy.
Is he your boss?

1520
01:59:30,370 --> 01:59:31,843
Sayba.
- Sardesai

1521
01:59:32,701 --> 01:59:35,323
I'll give you an idea.
A million dollar idea

1522
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:39,603
Create a vacancy in your
hotel and appoint Chantu

1523
01:59:39,683 --> 01:59:46,061
Once together, they'll throw
all hotels in Goa out of business

1524
01:59:46,141 --> 01:59:47,826
And your hotel will be tops

1525
01:59:47,906 --> 01:59:49,175
Really?
- Guarantee

1526
01:59:49,410 --> 01:59:51,029
But he never told me...

1527
01:59:51,548 --> 01:59:52,676
Get him.

1528
01:59:52,756 --> 01:59:55,291
I don't know where he is
He's very far...

1529
01:59:55,478 --> 01:59:57,672
Don't worry about money..

1530
01:59:59,234 --> 02:00:01,407
Listen!
- That's Chantu there!

1531
02:00:06,056 --> 02:00:09,183
Him...?
- Yes! The body builder! Mutton chop!

1532
02:00:09,331 --> 02:00:11,861
That's our sworn enemy.
How can they be friends?

1533
02:00:11,941 --> 02:00:13,091
Yes.

1534
02:00:13,171 --> 02:00:15,411
Are you joking?
You have to be

1535
02:00:15,971 --> 02:00:18,851
That's Chantu. How
can he be his enemy?

1536
02:00:20,883 --> 02:00:23,011
They must be conning somebody

1537
02:00:23,091 --> 02:00:25,411
Why are you saying this?

1538
02:00:26,397 --> 02:00:30,651
Tell the truth. Who is the victim?

1539
02:00:31,309 --> 02:00:32,749
Me.
- There you go

1540
02:00:33,392 --> 02:00:37,229
No...
- Shut up! Jaggu! Raja! Ram!

1541
02:00:37,502 --> 02:00:39,205
Damn you...!
- I messed things?

1542
02:00:39,285 --> 02:00:42,111
Major trouble!
- Rush down!

1543
02:00:42,191 --> 02:00:43,469
What...?

1544
02:00:45,404 --> 02:00:47,309
Where's he gone...?

1545
02:00:49,831 --> 02:00:53,431
Sardesai created trouble.
Sayba knows we're thick pals

1546
02:00:53,511 --> 02:00:56,613
You should've shut him up.
- I tried but he got carried away

1547
02:00:56,758 --> 02:00:58,872
I couldn't control him.
- You should've strangled him!

1548
02:00:58,952 --> 02:01:02,161
Forget about what happened.
Now how do we stop Sayba?

1549
02:01:02,542 --> 02:01:05,724
You go in. I'll manage him.
- Are you sure?

1550
02:01:05,804 --> 02:01:08,432
Yes. Where will he hide?
I'll dig him out!

1551
02:01:08,837 --> 02:01:11,152
You're hand in glove with him!
You...!

1552
02:01:16,289 --> 02:01:17,458
Get him!

1553
02:01:40,928 --> 02:01:42,650
Let go...!

1554
02:01:47,251 --> 02:01:48,691
Get the rascal!

1555
02:01:57,567 --> 02:02:00,003
Your game is up!

1556
02:02:20,106 --> 02:02:24,346
Killed my Sayba...!

1557
02:02:24,689 --> 02:02:28,546
Who killed my Sayba!

1558
02:02:28,746 --> 02:02:31,546
Who killed him?

1559
02:02:34,202 --> 02:02:35,546
Pedro... You?

1560
02:02:36,506 --> 02:02:40,066
Scoundrel! Who killed my brother?

1561
02:02:40,326 --> 02:02:43,405
I don't know. It was
going on for some days.

1562
02:02:43,485 --> 02:02:46,066
What's his name?
- Chantu

1563
02:02:47,683 --> 02:02:50,643
The cops are on my tail

1564
02:02:50,843 --> 02:02:53,403
I'll keep you informed
about where I'm hiding.

1565
02:02:53,963 --> 02:02:57,443
Let me know the moment
you find the boy. Got it?

1566
02:03:15,851 --> 02:03:16,811
Leaving?

1567
02:03:19,625 --> 02:03:22,611
I'm coming.
- When will you return?

1568
02:03:22,691 --> 02:03:26,251
Is this a five star hotel
that you ask when I'll return?

1569
02:03:26,451 --> 02:03:31,021
People who come here once
keep coming back for more

1570
02:03:31,101 --> 02:03:33,131
Not me but I'll send two guests.

1571
02:03:33,211 --> 02:03:39,931
The scamps because of whom
I landed here. Chantu-Bantu

1572
02:03:44,072 --> 02:03:45,959
I'm speaking.
- So am I

1573
02:03:46,118 --> 02:03:49,432
Pedro here!
- Oh. Are you well?

1574
02:03:50,749 --> 02:03:52,629
Did the stupid cops get you yet?

1575
02:03:52,709 --> 02:04:00,309
Till I nab my brother's killer,
even the god of death can't get me

1576
02:04:00,523 --> 02:04:04,432
Found Chantu?
- Not yet.

1577
02:04:04,631 --> 02:04:09,231
Pedro has no idea the man helping
him find his brother's killer...

1578
02:04:09,831 --> 02:04:12,191
himself is the killer's best friend

1579
02:04:12,871 --> 02:04:15,591
This news should be given to Pedro

1580
02:04:16,431 --> 02:04:17,951
But where the heck is he?

1581
02:04:18,111 --> 02:04:21,911
I'm hiding in the old cave.
Come here to inform me

1582
02:04:22,113 --> 02:04:27,873
If you tell anyone else,
I'll dig your grave here!

1583
02:04:28,027 --> 02:04:30,193
I get it. Okay

1584
02:04:44,033 --> 02:04:48,402
The hotel seems closed.
- Is it the right address?

1585
02:04:48,568 --> 02:04:51,087
The kids pulled a
fast one on us again

1586
02:04:51,246 --> 02:04:54,966
My son won't play
such a stupid prank

1587
02:04:55,564 --> 02:04:58,646
Your son!
- Where do we go? What do we do?

1588
02:04:59,892 --> 02:05:03,132
Are you the parents of Chantu-Bantu?
- That's right

1589
02:05:03,452 --> 02:05:07,452
I guessed right.
You look like their parents

1590
02:05:07,532 --> 02:05:11,692
Is that true?
- Do you know them?

1591
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:14,252
I'm their manager.
- Okay...

1592
02:05:14,332 --> 02:05:17,812
They sent me here to fetch you.
They're in an urgent meeting

1593
02:05:17,974 --> 02:05:19,532
Hop in

1594
02:05:37,147 --> 02:05:39,572
What? Want to die?

1595
02:05:46,556 --> 02:05:47,652
What...?

1596
02:05:50,582 --> 02:05:53,182
You did the right thing
in coming straight to me

1597
02:05:54,064 --> 02:05:56,102
I have an old account
to square with Pedro.

1598
02:05:57,022 --> 02:06:01,142
Pedro is a dangerous criminal.
We'll besiege the cave with our force

1599
02:06:01,222 --> 02:06:03,022
Where's the inspector?
- This way

1600
02:06:03,735 --> 02:06:06,015
Gomes has kidnapped your parents!

1601
02:06:06,215 --> 02:06:10,255
But he was in jail...?
- He's out. And he's got your parents

1602
02:06:10,335 --> 02:06:12,015
Now he wants to meet you

1603
02:06:12,095 --> 02:06:15,975
Who is Gomes?
- He was our assistant manager

1604
02:06:16,055 --> 02:06:19,609
We caught him stealing. He was
jailed. Maybe he wants revenge

1605
02:06:19,752 --> 02:06:22,432
This is a major problem.
- Sir, there's a plan

1606
02:06:22,598 --> 02:06:24,792
Who has it?
- Him. Tell him...

1607
02:06:25,572 --> 02:06:26,832
The plan...

1608
02:06:30,339 --> 02:06:34,792
I know you and Chantu are pals

1609
02:06:35,058 --> 02:06:39,818
I want to tell Pedro.
- What will you gain?

1610
02:06:40,216 --> 02:06:44,096
I want to get your bones broken

1611
02:06:44,378 --> 02:06:49,016
And Pedro will do that for me.
You'll take me to Pedro

1612
02:06:49,193 --> 02:06:53,780
You know what I'll do to your
parents if you won't take me

1613
02:06:54,258 --> 02:06:56,336
You sent me to jail!

1614
02:06:58,516 --> 02:07:02,236
One thing can be done.
Play this game with Chantu

1615
02:07:03,169 --> 02:07:05,876
I'll give you Rs. 10 lakhs
for sparing my parent's life.

1616
02:07:06,366 --> 02:07:11,276
You'll get your revenge and the cash
- Fooling me, you dumb waiter!

1617
02:07:11,476 --> 02:07:15,636
Where will you get the cash?
- I'm marrying Khanna's daughter

1618
02:07:15,716 --> 02:07:19,837
I'm dead if you refuse later.
- But you can tell Pedro about me

1619
02:07:19,917 --> 02:07:22,556
Don't forget he's your best friend!

1620
02:07:23,766 --> 02:07:28,036
People kill their brother to save
their skin. He's just a friend

1621
02:07:29,636 --> 02:07:32,636
Friend to a scoundrel.
- I'm a dog

1622
02:07:35,398 --> 02:07:36,117
What's this?

1623
02:07:38,084 --> 02:07:42,524
Bantu put a microphone in Gomes'
pocket. Now we can hear him

1624
02:07:43,050 --> 02:07:44,724
But how...?
- Just a minute

1625
02:07:52,293 --> 02:07:55,604
Man, where have you brought me?
- Hold your horses...

1626
02:07:56,645 --> 02:07:59,844
Anyone there?
- Good God!

1627
02:08:00,637 --> 02:08:03,675
Nobody here

1628
02:08:09,098 --> 02:08:12,378
What's wrong?
- Nothing

1629
02:08:30,204 --> 02:08:33,804
Yes?
- It's me. Bantu

1630
02:08:34,650 --> 02:08:36,204
Why have you come here?

1631
02:08:37,884 --> 02:08:40,164
Who is he?
- He's Gomes

1632
02:08:40,330 --> 02:08:42,964
Wants to talk about Chantu.
- Where is he?

1633
02:08:43,244 --> 02:08:46,804
Will you come this way?
- What is it?

1634
02:08:48,749 --> 02:08:51,884
Pedro Sir, do you want
Chantu's whereabouts?

1635
02:08:52,396 --> 02:08:57,884
Bantu can give it.
Actually they're best pals

1636
02:08:57,964 --> 02:09:00,644
Together they were making
an idiot out of your brother

1637
02:09:00,823 --> 02:09:04,244
What nonsense!
- I'd have found out by now...

1638
02:09:04,490 --> 02:09:09,564
The cops haven't got here because
their parents are in my control

1639
02:09:09,644 --> 02:09:13,124
At a place nobody can doubt.
- Where?

1640
02:09:14,266 --> 02:09:16,528
I'll tell you later

1641
02:09:17,807 --> 02:09:21,007
He's a cad! Just won't
mention where he hid them

1642
02:09:21,247 --> 02:09:23,847
Or we'd have got them now.
- Now what happens?

1643
02:09:24,699 --> 02:09:27,207
Now we'll use... plan number two

1644
02:09:28,527 --> 02:09:35,607
If your news is wrong, I'll
crack your skull like a coconut

1645
02:09:35,948 --> 02:09:37,047
Get it?

1646
02:09:44,894 --> 02:09:51,509
Swine! Where's your pal?
- Mr. Pedro, my friend is no more

1647
02:09:52,015 --> 02:09:55,535
Your brother was my friend.
- Silence!

1648
02:09:56,415 --> 02:10:00,575
But he says, your friend
killed my brother

1649
02:10:01,335 --> 02:10:03,815
And you're working with the cops!

1650
02:10:04,923 --> 02:10:09,735
Such a big lie! Dear God,
why is this happening to me?

1651
02:10:10,064 --> 02:10:13,855
Actually, the cops have kept a reward
of half a million on your head

1652
02:10:14,021 --> 02:10:17,446
He's blackmailing me to get that.
He kidnapped my girl friend

1653
02:10:17,617 --> 02:10:22,061
He forced me to take him to you.
- He's lying! Pedro, he's pretending

1654
02:10:22,297 --> 02:10:25,657
You're acting!
- Gomes! Stop it!

1655
02:10:26,516 --> 02:10:29,449
Move!

1656
02:10:30,224 --> 02:10:31,217
Move back!

1657
02:10:31,977 --> 02:10:36,577
Are you all right, Bantu?
- How'd you get out of his captivity?

1658
02:10:38,076 --> 02:10:40,177
This servant of the rascal
Gomes brought some food

1659
02:10:40,257 --> 02:10:43,439
Seizing the opportunity,
I clubbed him and escaped

1660
02:10:43,756 --> 02:10:47,756
What are you doing here?

1661
02:10:47,836 --> 02:10:50,340
Who is he?
- ACP Pande

1662
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:54,916
He was hiding and probably
listening to Radio Mirchi

1663
02:10:54,996 --> 02:11:00,777
Isn't that a wireless machine?
What were you listening to, on it?

1664
02:11:00,857 --> 02:11:03,156
Answer or I'll slaughter you!

1665
02:11:03,631 --> 02:11:06,391
Speak!
- Gomes gave us information

1666
02:11:06,671 --> 02:11:10,831
He'd lead us to you and
we're connected by wireless

1667
02:11:10,991 --> 02:11:16,143
There.
- Lies! It's a trick played by the cops

1668
02:11:16,337 --> 02:11:20,433
We'll know if the cop is lying.
Let's search him

1669
02:11:20,513 --> 02:11:24,071
Yes. - Stand straight.
Let me frisk you

1670
02:11:24,151 --> 02:11:28,111
I have nothing.
- We'll see

1671
02:11:31,413 --> 02:11:34,431
Pedro, my brother
this was in his pocket

1672
02:11:35,530 --> 02:11:39,231
What is it?
- It's called a microphone

1673
02:11:40,020 --> 02:11:46,631
5 miles away, the voice can
be heard through this machine

1674
02:11:46,787 --> 02:11:51,188
You hear it yourself.
- No, sir. They're pretending

1675
02:11:52,835 --> 02:11:55,951
1, 2, 3... that's it.

1676
02:11:59,027 --> 02:12:01,311
I'll settle scores with you later

1677
02:12:02,885 --> 02:12:04,725
I'll first make
mince meat out of you!

1678
02:12:05,206 --> 02:12:08,925
It's not my fault.
Listen to me. No!

1679
02:12:09,150 --> 02:12:11,365
One last chance. Listen...

1680
02:12:12,085 --> 02:12:16,565
I've locked their parents
in the jungle in a car

1681
02:12:16,801 --> 02:12:20,565
Get them here and
the truth will be clear

1682
02:12:20,845 --> 02:12:22,565
But put this away...

1683
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:28,293
Out!

1684
02:12:28,373 --> 02:12:30,765
Who are you?
- C'mon

1685
02:12:37,845 --> 02:12:41,654
Yes! Here they are.
2 families together!

1686
02:12:41,806 --> 02:12:46,968
Come on.
- Welcome

1687
02:12:49,397 --> 02:12:53,673
You come here... you this way...

1688
02:12:54,150 --> 02:12:58,474
This is Mr. Pedro. Tell him that
you're Chantu and Bantu's parents

1689
02:12:58,654 --> 02:13:03,234
And Chantu and Bantu are
best friends since they were 4

1690
02:13:03,462 --> 02:13:06,062
But towards whom do we point?

1691
02:13:09,033 --> 02:13:11,822
Don't you recognize your own son?
- Must be the one who is tied

1692
02:13:12,762 --> 02:13:14,610
My son!

1693
02:13:15,011 --> 02:13:18,304
My darling! My love!

1694
02:13:18,385 --> 02:13:21,185
Whom is he kissing?
- what have they done to you?

1695
02:13:21,383 --> 02:13:23,425
That cad is a cop!

1696
02:13:24,234 --> 02:13:29,492
What do I do with you?
- Like the cheat Bantu...

1697
02:13:30,066 --> 02:13:32,505
his parents are cheats. By God!

1698
02:13:33,250 --> 02:13:37,815
Give me one chance.
I'll skin his parents!

1699
02:13:37,895 --> 02:13:39,650
Then I'll see how he screams!

1700
02:13:46,712 --> 02:13:49,853
You said you'd pay us.
Then why are you hitting us?

1701
02:13:55,091 --> 02:13:57,850
Confess that Bantu is your son!

1702
02:13:59,180 --> 02:14:00,342
Stop!

1703
02:14:05,118 --> 02:14:08,518
You never said you too
would be acting

1704
02:14:09,158 --> 02:14:13,798
Now, who are you?
- I'm Principal Sardesai

1705
02:14:14,118 --> 02:14:18,615
I run an acting school.
You must have heard of it

1706
02:14:18,844 --> 02:14:21,434
Here's my card. This man
came to me yesterday

1707
02:14:21,771 --> 02:14:25,674
Said, he'd give a chance
to our students in a film

1708
02:14:26,060 --> 02:14:29,754
You said, it's a role
of parents of 2 youngsters

1709
02:14:30,053 --> 02:14:33,474
You never mentioned whips.
We charge extra for that

1710
02:14:34,862 --> 02:14:36,633
Now what do you have to say?

1711
02:14:39,069 --> 02:14:41,674
Move. Acting school!!

1712
02:14:42,965 --> 02:14:45,914
I know this schmuck well

1713
02:14:46,106 --> 02:14:48,754
He's the Principal of
Chantu and Bantu's college

1714
02:14:49,005 --> 02:14:51,434
He's hand in glove with them.

1715
02:14:51,914 --> 02:14:54,674
They're all together.
- He's the only one separate

1716
02:14:54,830 --> 02:14:57,554
I'll show him!
- Don't hit me!

1717
02:14:57,634 --> 02:14:58,594
Stop!

1718
02:15:00,552 --> 02:15:03,437
Now who is she?
- No idea.

1719
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:08,143
I'm a helpless woman
tormented by Chantu-Bantu

1720
02:15:08,750 --> 02:15:11,783
Gomes is right. Chantu
and Bantu are friends

1721
02:15:12,805 --> 02:15:17,150
Brother Pedro, they're responsible
for sending your brother to his grave

1722
02:15:17,383 --> 02:15:19,966
Do you have evidence?
- That's not needed

1723
02:15:20,046 --> 02:15:23,623
Whip the boy
and his mother will yell

1724
02:15:23,703 --> 02:15:26,823
My Bantu!!

1725
02:15:27,009 --> 02:15:33,343
A son may ignore his mother's pain
but a mother can't bear his agony

1726
02:15:35,463 --> 02:15:36,743
That's right.

1727
02:15:38,833 --> 02:15:41,343
Let's give it a try

1728
02:15:42,645 --> 02:15:45,503
Gomes, you get another chance

1729
02:15:45,641 --> 02:15:47,023
Get started.

1730
02:15:47,814 --> 02:15:49,063
Make way!

1731
02:15:51,073 --> 02:15:54,183
Now we'll know whose son you are

1732
02:15:58,020 --> 02:15:59,722
Don't beat him!

1733
02:16:04,018 --> 02:16:05,880
Stop!

1734
02:16:06,952 --> 02:16:09,338
Now what do you want?

1735
02:16:09,418 --> 02:16:15,379
This woman is a cheat. Bantu
caught her red handed in your hotel

1736
02:16:15,766 --> 02:16:18,246
She's seeking revenge.
- No!

1737
02:16:18,499 --> 02:16:23,726
Really? Didn't you come to our hotel
as Queen of Janakpur for a free meal?

1738
02:16:24,166 --> 02:16:28,566
She mixed glass in the pudding
and blackmailed the late Sayba

1739
02:16:28,686 --> 02:16:30,646
But that...
- Heard that?

1740
02:16:31,006 --> 02:16:32,766
Bantu had exposed her hoax.

1741
02:16:33,486 --> 02:16:37,566
I was demoted from Manager to
Laundry Manager because of him

1742
02:16:37,966 --> 02:16:41,166
But I'll only speak the truth

1743
02:16:44,447 --> 02:16:49,726
I can't bear it no more!
Now I'll fire a gun not the dagger!

1744
02:16:49,806 --> 02:16:53,046
Hold it.
- What the heck!

1745
02:16:53,276 --> 02:16:57,739
Now who is it?
- Hold on. Hear me out first

1746
02:16:59,131 --> 02:17:02,371
Whoever you are, don't say
Chantu-Bantu are friends...

1747
02:17:02,771 --> 02:17:06,011
and are in this together.
- Right, but first listen...

1748
02:17:06,091 --> 02:17:09,371
I'll show you. I have evidence

1749
02:17:09,771 --> 02:17:14,657
Here they are and that's
Mr. Khanna, the elder brother...

1750
02:17:19,998 --> 02:17:23,331
Now what do you have to say?

1751
02:17:28,052 --> 02:17:29,931
Now I'm convinced

1752
02:17:33,815 --> 02:17:36,914
Anybody there to stop me?

1753
02:17:38,146 --> 02:17:41,536
No one.
- Nobody... come on.

1754
02:17:41,681 --> 02:17:45,341
Move it. Come on!

1755
02:17:45,591 --> 02:17:50,111
I give you one minute
to tell where your pal is

1756
02:17:50,255 --> 02:17:52,351
Else I'll shoot everyone

1757
02:17:53,687 --> 02:17:57,540
You finish the rest
while I shoot him

1758
02:17:57,727 --> 02:18:01,151
I'll count to 3. One...

1759
02:18:01,532 --> 02:18:03,608
Two...
- Stop.

1760
02:18:07,801 --> 02:18:10,431
You! You're here, you jerk!

1761
02:18:10,928 --> 02:18:15,328
I'll first shoot you!
You've troubled me a lot!

1762
02:18:16,001 --> 02:18:17,648
Who threw the shoe?

1763
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:20,208
Did you throw it? You...?

1764
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:22,823
You?
You?

1765
02:18:23,273 --> 02:18:24,608
You?

1766
02:18:25,248 --> 02:18:26,368
Not me

1767
02:18:27,017 --> 02:18:30,728
It was you. Show me your foot!

1768
02:18:31,147 --> 02:18:33,408
Show me your foot!

1769
02:18:39,081 --> 02:18:41,081
Beat them up!

1770
02:18:44,924 --> 02:18:47,601
Let me go!
- Don't spare him!

1771
02:19:07,296 --> 02:19:10,842
My shoe! The shoe...

1772
02:19:17,738 --> 02:19:20,258
Freeze! Nobody moves!

1773
02:19:21,229 --> 02:19:22,538
Nobody moves!

1774
02:19:24,197 --> 02:19:25,938
Why are you laughing?

1775
02:19:27,656 --> 02:19:28,698
Shoe!

1776
02:19:33,282 --> 02:19:35,138
Threatening me with a shoe!

1777
02:19:36,147 --> 02:19:37,206
Let me wear it

1778
02:19:43,134 --> 02:19:47,597
Let me wear the shoe. I said,
time please! I'm just not ready...

1779
02:20:00,112 --> 02:20:03,872
I hear you give chance to new heroes.
- Yes

1780
02:20:04,161 --> 02:20:07,592
You have a great personality.
Here's my card

1781
02:20:08,271 --> 02:20:09,503
I'll make you a hero

1782
02:20:10,430 --> 02:20:12,072
Excuse me.
- Please...

1783
02:20:12,396 --> 02:20:13,592
Is she a heroine?
- Yes

1784
02:20:15,218 --> 02:20:16,472
You talk to anyone

1785
02:20:26,649 --> 02:20:29,853
Side! Or I'll break your head.
- No bullet in it

1786
02:20:33,264 --> 02:20:35,105
I can handle you with my legs

1787
02:20:40,322 --> 02:20:42,474
What a shot!

1788
02:20:47,653 --> 02:20:49,893
On whose side are you?
- Sir, but I'm your man!

1789
02:20:49,973 --> 02:20:52,413
Your laundry manager.
- Thank God

1790
02:20:54,133 --> 02:20:56,413
Get your clothes washed
for free in the laundry

1791
02:20:58,653 --> 02:20:59,613
Where's he gone?

1792
02:21:11,410 --> 02:21:13,540
Gill, move some more

1793
02:21:16,529 --> 02:21:19,863
You got my son whipped! You!

1794
02:21:21,897 --> 02:21:24,735
My son!
- She's caught us!

1795
02:21:24,942 --> 02:21:29,502
The mother not only cries but
uses the whip when her son is hurt

1796
02:21:29,737 --> 02:21:31,370
Don't you have men at home?
- Shut up!

1797
02:21:49,449 --> 02:21:50,729
Don't' be scared. Come on

1798
02:21:52,729 --> 02:21:55,649
Don't hide behind a woman. Come out!
- Face him!

1799
02:21:55,729 --> 02:21:58,089
He has a stick!
- Coward, come out!

1800
02:21:59,409 --> 02:22:02,009
Hit the man, don't talk.
- Holy smoke!

1801
02:22:02,089 --> 02:22:03,049
Shall we go?

1802
02:22:12,953 --> 02:22:15,033
Whose side are you on?
- Pedro's

1803
02:22:15,113 --> 02:22:17,326
So am I.
- Really?

1804
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:19,513
I lied to you

1805
02:22:21,402 --> 02:22:23,673
Where has he gone?
I'm going home!

1806
02:23:11,858 --> 02:23:14,698
Mother! I am fine

1807
02:23:15,155 --> 02:23:17,138
Get the ambulance

1808
02:23:33,810 --> 02:23:35,263
Leave him!

1809
02:23:44,827 --> 02:23:47,285
My brother! Bantu!

1810
02:23:47,483 --> 02:23:49,627
You can't leave me alone!

1811
02:23:54,567 --> 02:23:55,867
My child!

1812
02:24:20,374 --> 02:24:24,054
The bullet just grazed your arm.
How did you get the other wounds?

1813
02:24:24,734 --> 02:24:29,734
What can I say?
A short prank proved costly

1814
02:24:29,990 --> 02:24:30,934
Meaning?

1815
02:24:31,486 --> 02:24:34,694
I pretended to die when shot

1816
02:24:35,534 --> 02:24:38,174
I held my breath as long as I could

1817
02:24:39,081 --> 02:24:41,854
But when I took a
breath after a minute...

1818
02:24:42,229 --> 02:24:49,502
I started laughing. Sundri,
Mundri and Chantu beat me up

1819
02:24:51,933 --> 02:24:53,214
You're a rogue

1820
02:24:56,146 --> 02:24:58,786
Now come and sit with the guests

1821
02:24:58,866 --> 02:25:01,146
We're coming. Just hold on

1822
02:25:01,226 --> 02:25:04,266
Your kids worked a miracle.

1823
02:25:04,409 --> 02:25:06,569
Something that wasn't working...

1824
02:25:06,769 --> 02:25:08,129
is now operational

1825
02:25:09,490 --> 02:25:12,089
Our resort was shut for years

1826
02:25:12,266 --> 02:25:15,809
They not only ran it
but ran it so capably...

1827
02:25:15,889 --> 02:25:18,441
that it's earning more
profits than our other resorts.

1828
02:25:18,521 --> 02:25:23,009
We're what you call it...
finding such good what's it..?

1829
02:25:26,787 --> 02:25:29,027
Happy to find such sons-in-law.

1830
02:25:29,667 --> 02:25:34,187
We'll take guru's blessings and
get them engaged and married soon

1831
02:25:34,450 --> 02:25:35,467
Guru?

1832
02:25:36,698 --> 02:25:41,627
He's not what you call it...
- No saint

1833
02:25:41,939 --> 02:25:44,265
An industrialist.
Totally detached

1834
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:46,360
We worked for him

1835
02:25:46,575 --> 02:25:51,480
We initiate every good deed
of life with guru's blessings

1836
02:25:52,205 --> 02:25:54,254
There he comes!

1837
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:59,280
Welcome.
- May you be happy

1838
02:26:02,319 --> 02:26:03,279
You!

1839
02:26:05,168 --> 02:26:08,519
What are these goons doing here?
- We're dead meat!
