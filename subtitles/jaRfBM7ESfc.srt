1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,266
We just launched our new Feastables bar,

2
00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:04,000
which is new branding
and all new formula. It tastes amazing.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,550
I like it.

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,150
And to celebrate,
I paid a bunch of people

5
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,500
to make commercials for it, ranging
from $1 all the way up to $10,000.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
And we're going to see
if more money equals a better commercial,

7
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:14,400
starting with this $1 commercial.

8
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,000
Okay.

9
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:17,466
It's just a person moving it.

10
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:19,650
They're filming their computer monitor.

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,483
This is clearly a joke.

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,200
What is that?

13
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,150
Why wouldn't
you just record on your screen?

14
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,200
This is probably their way of saying

15
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,900
screw you for only paying a dollar.

16
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,950
Yeah, I can't imagine anybody
would give you any care for $1.

17
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,100
I mean, to be honest, for television

18
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,900
this is actually a lot of effort.
Oh, it's over.

19
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,650
That was awesome.

20
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,883
No, if I ran that as an ad during
the Super Bowl?

21
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,416
No.

22
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:38,833
So far you get what you pay for.

23
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,650
That sucked.

24
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,850
Now, let's jump
over to the $50 commercial.

25
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,050
Now it's going to get better.

26
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,050
Well, as long as they don't start
drawing it. What is this?

27
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,166
At least they're not recording
with a phone this time.

28
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,100
There's no music.

29
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,100
What do you want
from these people? $50.

30
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,466
At what price point do we get
sound with our commercial?

31
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,616
It's getting better.

32
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:54,966
Well, it ended abruptly.
Okay.

33
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:56,750
Didn't really get to look at it, did we?

34
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,100
Surely
the $100 commercial has audio.

35
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,800
It does.

36
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:01,600
Matthew, No junk food.

37
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,266
We need to start eating better.

38
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,200
What?

39
00:01:04,216 --> 00:01:05,466
Who made this?

40
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,600
So just follow me and I'll lead you
right to the healthier snacks.

41
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:11,266
- What is going on?
- This makes me really uncomfortable.

42
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:12,883
- And I don't know why.
- I love this.

43
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:13,633
I'm in pain.

44
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,550
Way too many words.

45
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,900
I haven't listened to anything
they've said.

46
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,900
What are you doing in the candy
section?

47
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,033
Looking at candy.

48
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,300
Get to the point.

49
00:01:20,316 --> 00:01:23,500
Just look at these.
Sea salt. Deez nuts.

50
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:24,816
These aren't even the new ones.

51
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:26,850
The whole point of the commercial
is our new bars.

52
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,500
You suck.

53
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,216
This is what it looks like now.

54
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,700
This is what it looks like now.

55
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,850
Surely the $10,000 commercial
will be better.

56
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,566
Let's see. The $500 one.

57
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,366
Feastables.

58
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:39,850
Don't mind if I do.

59
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,483
I'm down. I love it.

60
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,300
That was a cool effect.

61
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,816
I like that. Oh, the hand.

62
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,583
This is the best thing that's ever
been created.

63
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,316
That was pretty good.

64
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,050
I mean, imagine
you're flipping on TikTok,

65
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,383
and then you see someone
just go Feastables.

66
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,700
After watching that commercial.

67
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,550
Do you want to eat this amazing
chocolate?

68
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,766
- Yes.
- Well, yes I do.

69
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:08,050
It’s nice to have a Feastable

70
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,100
I'd love to share a piece with you.

71
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:11,166
I love jingles.

72
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,616
It’s really the least that I can do.

73
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,516
This is fire.

74
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,666
MrBeast has made a treat for me…

75
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,633
And you.

76
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,716
And you.

77
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:23,550
How did I know?

78
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,200
Oh, it's popping up. Pop off.

79
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,700
He could have made the background
a little cleaner for $500.

80
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,200
I'm sorry.
What is?

81
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,150
Yeah, for him to clean up his room and like

82
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,500
iron the shirt in the background.

83
00:02:34,516 --> 00:02:35,766
That's. That's $1,000.

84
00:02:35,816 --> 00:02:38,850
For $500 I don't want to see
a single Funko Pop in the frame.

85
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:40,466
Wait, did he add
that in or is that

86
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,450
just a plate with a
Feastable score?

87
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:43,950
I genuinely can't tell.

88
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,416
You know what? Just because
of that, it's worth the $500.

89
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,200
Thank you, sir.

90
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,150
MrBeast asked us to make
a commercial for Feastables.

91
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,850
The budget was $500.

92
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,400
We made Feastable s'mores instead.

93
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,683
Best decision ever.

94
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,850
We also made this.

95
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,850
Oh, this is really good.

96
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,100
This is the first actual
real commercial so far.

97
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,400
Thanks for the chocolate. Feastables.

98
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,150
You're welcome.

99
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,500
I mean, it had beautiful shots,
but that wasn't really an ad.

100
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,400
That was more of them just saying hi to me.

101
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,850
Let's see how the $750 commercial
turned out.

102
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:13,116
Beast anime.

103
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:13,900
Cool.

104
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,950
This is so cool.

105
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:20,800
That's really cool.

106
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,733
This is awesome.

107
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:23,183
- All right, I'll say it.
- I was going to say it.

108
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:24,416
I'll say it. It was a little short.

109
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,166
Well, animation takes a long time.

110
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,350
I agree. It was awesome.
I love the quality.

111
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,600
It made me look way cooler than I do
in real life.

112
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,950
All that just a little short.

113
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,216
That was $750.

114
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:35,816
I wonder what the $10,000 one
looks like.

115
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,133
- It's so good.
- Yes.

116
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:40,133
This is really uncomfortable.

117
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,800
I don't think we should put this
on TV.

118
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,000
That's.

119
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,300
This is a commercial.

120
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,150
Nothing makes me want to buy
chocolate like rats eating it.

121
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,716
I can't tell if this is good for our
brand or not, but it's funny.

122
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,816
All right, now,
the thousand dollar commercial.

123
00:03:54,816 --> 00:03:56,133
We're dropping thow-ee's.

124
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,416
The zoom in.

125
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,666
Tareq would nerd out about this.

126
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,333
Tareq is like, "All right, 
this is the best one yet."

127
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,633
- Oh, that was sweet.
- I'm sorry, but...

128
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,850
I'm not kissing somebody
just so I can eat chocolate.

129
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:10,500
They bought a jersey.
High effort.

130
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,400
Oh no. He is out of Feastables.

131
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,666
If you're wondering where you
can buy Feastables, go to Walmart.

132
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,366
Go to Walmart.

133
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:17,016
$2,000.

134
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:18,900
Now we're starting
to get to the beefy price point.

135
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,550
- I thought it was chocolate, not beef.
- My bad.

136
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,833
Well, it's a film set.

137
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,333
- That looks cool.
- I like this song.

138
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,583
This is a meta commercial.
The whole point

139
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,966
is shooting a commercial
about shooting a commercial.

140
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:39,433
I mean, they make the product look good.

141
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:40,133
There we go.

142
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,066
That's a cool shot.

143
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:44,166
Oh, it fell. Ha ha. Quirky.
This is still going.

144
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,150
I mean, you paid a lot of money.

145
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,650
I did pay two grand, so.

146
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,116
Why was that funny too?

147
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,650
He just poured milk on it.

148
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,400
Nice.

149
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:54,400
Oh, that was the ending.

150
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:55,250
I don't get it.

151
00:04:55,283 --> 00:04:56,066
My head hurts.

152
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,783
Next.

153
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,483
He's got veiny hands.

154
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,450
I understand
why his veins are popping out.

155
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,300
Look how tight his watch is.

156
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,266
Jeez, tight watch.

157
00:05:05,283 --> 00:05:07,066
You're going to cut off circulation.

158
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,750
Needs to clean the nails a little bit.
I'm sorry.

159
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,700
All right, first the veins,
second the nails.

160
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:13,200
$3,000. He couldn't go get
a manicure first?

161
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,750
I think your nails are fine.

162
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,600
Hey tight watch?

163
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,400
I respect you.

164
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,383
Oh, that's a pretty shot. That was it?

165
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,083
What?
I hope your watch falls off, bro.

166
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,200
Now it's time for the $5,000
commercial.

167
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,066
What's after 5K?

168
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,816
The $10,000 commercial.

169
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,800
Loud equals funny.

170
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,400
If you were me four years ago.

171
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:35,150
I thought that was not chocolate.

172
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,350
- Are you eating my Feastables?
- No, man, it wasn't me.

173
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:38,616
I can see it all over your face.

174
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:40,800
It isn't even feasible that
I feasted on the Feastables.

175
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,983
I've been on the farm all day
fantasizing about those Feastables.

176
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,350
It's an entirely new formula.

177
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,216
It is, brownie points
for mentioning the new formula.

178
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:50,250
Brownie points for his cheetah
print pants.

179
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,150
Hey guys, where's the dog...?

180
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:00,850
Told you.

181
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:04,300
Oh, now he's eating his Feastables.

182
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,333
That is better.

183
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,266
- I don't like.
- I love that.

184
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,750
Find your favorite flavor from milk
chocolate, milky milky, milk crunch.

185
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,800
Milky milky.

186
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,716
Feastables.

187
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,466
They're better than dog...

188
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,016
- Points off for swearing.
- Yes.

189
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,150
More importantly, though,
I want you to comment down below.

190
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,866
Did that make you want to go buy
chocolate from Walmart?

191
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:20,650
That's the best one yet.

192
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,500
Now we have a second
$5000 commercial.

193
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,250
We sent everyone
a bunch of our new bars

194
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,250
and on top of that,
if they requested me to film footage,

195
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,300
I filmed it and sent it to them.

196
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,500
This is the first one
to ask me to film something.

197
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,500
Let's see how they use it.

198
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,650
This is so cool.

199
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,516
Well, it's got a dog.
I'm already on board.

200
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:40,183
Tell me that my bad vibes
are hitting the streets.

201
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,466
What is going on?

202
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:43,500
This is going to change the world.

203
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,100
Some point, we'll see
the Feastables chocolate, I assume.

204
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,550
Or not.
Maybe they just...

205
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,566
- Okay, there we go.
- Yeah!

206
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,050
We finally see the product.

207
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,016
Deliver these
and make them smile.

208
00:06:58,533 --> 00:06:59,483
Hey!

209
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:01,850
Oh no.

210
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,850
What's in the briefcase, Happy Feet?

211
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,333
I'm going to be saying
that for the rest of my life.

212
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,266
Look, they're doing good deeds now
because they're MrBeast.

213
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:18,800
The world will never be happy.

214
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,950
Bro, what in the?

215
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,250
Did this guy think we wanted a movie?

216
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:25,950
Because I told them
I wanted a commercial.

217
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,250
That was a good shot.

218
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,516
Delivered to the world.

219
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,183
- That was you.
- That was me.

220
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,400
They asked me to film that clip.

221
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,383
They literally went out of their way to
ask you for a one-second clip of you?

222
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,866
And you put in 1% effort into it.

223
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,400
"Feast like a beast.
Feastables.com."

224
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,700
That was really a lot of effort.

225
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,733
And now the moment you've all been
waiting for.

226
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:45,616
I know I have.

227
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,216
Let's see what a $10,000 commercial is.

228
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:48,916
Better be good.

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,716
Halloween.

230
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,850
I got some Trick or Treaters.

231
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:53,766
Trick or Treat.

232
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,633
They took the whole thing.

233
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,450
This guy looks like he'd steal
some chocolate.

234
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:00,116
The product looks
very good in that shot.

235
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,766
Oh no.
Bisexual lighting.

236
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:04,900
This is shot so well.

237
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:06,216
It's a pirate.
Oh gosh.

238
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:07,650
Are they going to steal more candy?

239
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,050
Trick or Treat? I'm a banana.

240
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,833
He just can't get enough, can he?

241
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,100
Wait, watch. He's going to re-ring it.

242
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,250
He's going to have
a different costume on.

243
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,016
Oh, I knew it.

244
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,050
Twick or Tweat.

245
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,600
That was really uncomfortably gross.

246
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,433
Man, didn't I tell you to get...

247
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:25,216
Trick or Treat.

248
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,850
Happy Halloween, fellas.

249
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,400
Yeah, that cowboy just looks like
people I went to high school with.

250
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,700
That's him.

251
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,100
That's the guy who stole my candy.

252
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,750
I'm down for this.

253
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,616
I like this.

254
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,783
Feastables.

255
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:44,283
World's best chocolate.

256
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,750
I mean...

257
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:47,383
I...
I...

258
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,750
To be fair, I gave them chocolate bars
with no direction.

259
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,350
I don't know if this would
convert to sales, but they're funny.

260
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,633
So if these commercials made you
want to try Feastables,

261
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,733
go to Walmart and
try our milk chocolate bar,

262
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,450
our milk crunch bar, our almond bar,
our peanut butter bar,

263
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,550
our dark chocolate bar,

264
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,300
our dark chocolate sea salt bar
or our peanut butter crunch bar.

265
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,250
All seven flavors
are now available at Walmart.

266
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,500
Go give it a try
and tell me what you think.

267
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,650
Do it or I won't like you.

268
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,383
We'll punch you.

269
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,600
Whatever we're ending the video.
