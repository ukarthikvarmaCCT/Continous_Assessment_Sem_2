1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,620
- Chris and Chandler both have five lives

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,050
and every time they laugh in
this video, they lose one.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,950
- I don't wanna die.

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,783
- I'm not laughing.

5
00:00:05,783 --> 00:00:07,830
- And whoever has the most
lives at the end of this video,

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,260
move, wins whatever's in this briefcase.

7
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,550
- What's inside it, Jimmy?

8
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,250
- It's an amazing,
super expensive, insane,

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,230
one of kind prize that you wanna win.

10
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,203
- I wanna win it. He said it. I want it.

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,293
- Yo.
- Stop.

12
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:23,493
- She just said stop like it was okay.

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,020
- He said no.

14
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,130
- Bro, we're trying to free you.

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,540
- Oof.

16
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,310
Oh, wait, what?
- Bill!

17
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,050
- How many drinks are in there?

18
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,883
- Wow.

19
00:00:34,883 --> 00:00:36,884
- I'm trying so hard not to laugh.

20
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:37,862
- Let it out.

21
00:00:37,862 --> 00:00:39,142
- Oh, I've seen this.

22
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:40,225
- Let it out.

23
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,530
Let.

24
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,790
- You thought.
- Seen that one.

25
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,350
- This is my impression of 40th president

26
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,610
of the United States, Ronald Reagan,

27
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,800
attempting to communicate
through the mortal coil

28
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,188
but the only open channel
is through your Wiimote.

29
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:53,306
Well I'm in hell.

30
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:56,820
- All right, we got Chandler for sure.

31
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,710
- There was so oddly specific

32
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,960
and it really did
actually sound like that.

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,880
- Both the boys lost
life, we must continue.

34
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,380
- See, yeah, this is funny.

35
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,643
Can't even eat in Ohio, bro.

36
00:01:06,643 --> 00:01:09,270
What is going on in Ohio right now?

37
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,200
- Oh my gosh.

38
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,520
When your husband asks to bring home

39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,070
a piece of cake from the
neighbor's kid's birthday.

40
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:16,726
Ha.

41
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:17,913
- Oh.
- Oh.

42
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:21,247
- Oh okay, I like that.

43
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,860
- Oh.

44
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,300
- That's not funny, that's painful.

45
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,040
- She better wake up
right now, I'm so hungry.

46
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,840
- Ain't no way she's falling asleep.

47
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,650
- That's why you should
eat at Beast Burger

48
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,490
instead of Subway.

49
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,710
- That's not funny.
- Don't laugh.

50
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,543
- Oh.

51
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:36,690
- Walt, was it a laugh?
- Yes.

52
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,830
- According to referee Walt,

53
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,000
they both just lost another life.

54
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,680
- Can we ask the committee to review that?

55
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,270
- Sure.
- Can you guys review that?

56
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,220
- No.
- Argh, prick.

57
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,510
That's how I feel right now

58
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,520
'cause I was trying to
make Chandler laugh.

59
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,353
- Wait, show me what to do.

60
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:50,490
- No I'm not gonna do
it now, I'm not dumb.

61
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,090
Go away, ew, ew.

62
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,090
- Brayden, go back in your bed.

63
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,730
- What you doing if Tucker pulls that?

64
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,460
- We're gonna have to go
sit down with a therapist

65
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,080
and have a long conversation

66
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,660
about how we deal with emotions.

67
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,620
Are you okay, buddy?

68
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,453
You doing all right?

69
00:02:08,453 --> 00:02:11,040
Talk, say something, react,
it's a reacts channel.

70
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,590
- I'll cry.
- I'm here.

71
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,870
- Oh my god, Mike Tyson would
love that pigeon though.

72
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,923
- Look at his eye.

73
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,070
- We just witnessed a murder.

74
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,090
Good thing they paused it.

75
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,650
- If they didn't pause it we would've seen

76
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,490
something bad happen.

77
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,020
- Well something would've
happened to that bird.

78
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,520
But since they paused it, the bird's fine.

79
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,320
- I actually said this to Chris.

80
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,640
- Yeah you're gonna have to do better.

81
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,890
- I accurately found what you guys like.

82
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,300
He sent it you 'cause you liked it.

83
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,460
- Here's the thing, the
one we saw originally,

84
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,700
there's a change, it said,
"What going on in Ohio."

85
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,320
- Bring up Ohio at the end of the video.

86
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,340
- Hey, what are you doing in here?

87
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,620
I said don't come in here
when we're recording.

88
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,090
- Oh, that was a scam.

89
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,530
- That had to have been fake, right?

90
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,350
- That was, of course, fake.

91
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,647
- Oh Jesus.

92
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:51,847
- Have no fear, Spiderman is here.

93
00:02:51,847 --> 00:02:52,680
- Damn.

94
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,825
Tom Holland got a little less attractive.

95
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:55,658
- What happened?

96
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:57,660
- I was bitten by a regular spider.

97
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,950
- A radial spider.

98
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,413
- I have the power of
minutes left to live.

99
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,790
- Hundreds gather today to
say their final goodbyes

100
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,910
to this fallen Louisville police officer,

101
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,433
Dee Dee Mega Doo Doo.

102
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,020
- Chandler has officially taken the lead.

103
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,853
Come up here.

104
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:17,686
Hey, you can laugh now.

105
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:20,073
- Oh my God, she didn't realize it

106
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:21,810
'til after she said it.

107
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,640
God damn, what was the name?

108
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,373
- She's crazy.

109
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,190
- Chandler, it is now your game to lose.

110
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,250
Are you gonna rise to the
occasion or are you gonna laugh?

111
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,750
If you laugh, you lose.

112
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,350
- All right, I'm never laughing.

113
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,520
- If Jimmy was doing these
videos, he would lose.

114
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,590
Jimmy laughs at literally everything.

115
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,910
The goat's a nice touch.

116
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,080
That guy's muscular.

117
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,310
That guy's not.
- Beans.

118
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,273
- But good for him.

119
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,110
- Oh he missed the trick.

120
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,950
You can't even break your board?

121
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,400
- Can't even break his board.

122
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:54,873
- Oh!

123
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,700
What is this kid doing?
- Oh.

124
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,410
- Why did the other one throw up?

125
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,243
- Oh.

126
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,863
- What?

127
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:08,280
- It's a little German kid,

128
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,041
little German kids are hilarious.

129
00:04:12,076 --> 00:04:15,570
Yippee!

130
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,550
Good, harder, more aggressive.

131
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,930
- Cat, this is what you were made to do.

132
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,180
- You can't throw a brick, it's too heavy.

133
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,680
But a can of soup, you can really put

134
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,365
some power into that, right?

135
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,176
- Did he say that?
- You didn't know that?

136
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:27,009
- No.

137
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:28,770
- And this soup is just for my family,

138
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,910
it's just for my family.

139
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,900
- Ah!

140
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,733
- What are you so mad about,

141
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:32,566
you little sucker?

142
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:33,399
- Let's see if the snake gets him.

143
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:34,232
- What'd he say?

144
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:36,570
- He bunked it.

145
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,040
- These are very southern memes.

146
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,240
- This a red neck thing?

147
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,742
That was on purpose.

148
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,575
- Yeah that was a little staged.

149
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:47,490
- If I shoot you, you're in the clan.

150
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,540
- Please, please, please, please,

151
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,370
please, please, please, please,

152
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,510
please, please, please, please.

153
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,980
- Does he make it?

154
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,510
- Sorry, you didn't make it the clan.

155
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,343
- Oh.

156
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,263
- I love those videos.

157
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:04,470
- Is it gonna lift?
- Refried beans.

158
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,240
- Oh my gosh.

159
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,073
- Beautiful.

160
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:07,906
- I didn't know that was a thing.

161
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:08,739
I want it.

162
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:12,032
- Oh, that's.

163
00:05:12,032 --> 00:05:12,865
I laughed.

164
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:13,698
- He did laugh.

165
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:14,640
- Wait, did he laugh?

166
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,383
Play it back.
- Oh, that's.

167
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,240
- It is now tied 2-2, hey,
screw what you're gonna say

168
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,250
about that.
- Wait, wait, wait,

169
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,920
tutu is what a ballerina wears.

170
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,903
- But the score's also 2 to 2.

171
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,740
- Hey, you got a napkin?

172
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,820
- Yeah I got you.

173
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,293
- Why is he so close?

174
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,380
- That's probably one of
the best ones I've seen.

175
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,370
- Thank you.

176
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,930
- That one was really good.

177
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,880
- Gosh, that's hard, this is so hard.

178
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,713
- Banana.

179
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,083
- Is he playing the-

180
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,433
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

181
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:49,301
- Is the kid farting the whole way?

182
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,289
- He was, he was farting the whole way.

183
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:52,408
- What are the rules, Walt?

184
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:53,880
Huh? Was there no laughing on that?

185
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,990

- Chris laughed.

187
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,150
- It was a little walking fart.

188
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,680
- That little walking
fart brought you down

189
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,880
to your last life.

190
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,380
- I don't wanna die, Jimmy.

191
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,400
- Then stop laughing.

192
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,480
You know what happens when you die?

193
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,770
- I can't go to Ohio?

194
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,603

- That was so hard not to laugh at.

197
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,270
- Take a look at this nice break

198
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,560

Countries whose leaders pooped
themselves in McDonald's.

- Now you both have one life.

212
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:47,130

crazy prize behind you?

214

- Is it Mucinex 'cause I'm sick?

215
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,240
- It's better than curing all
the diseases on the planet.

216
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,350
- I don't know if I'd say that.

217
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,183
- It is.

218
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,320
Whoever loses will regret
it 'til the day they die.

219
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,850
- Oh gosh, I'm never laughing.

220
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,160

10 year old me is asleep.

221

224
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:08,820

- You got it, kid.

00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:12,870
What if he just punches him?

229
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,083
Is he going the wrong way?
- What are you doing?

230
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,913
Give me that.
