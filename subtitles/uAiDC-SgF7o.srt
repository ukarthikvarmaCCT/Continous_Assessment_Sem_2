00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,241
Hello, friends.

2
00:00:01,241 --> 00:00:03,426
If you remember, in 2017,

3
00:00:03,426 --> 00:00:08,061
the video of Paytm's CEO and founder 
Vijay Shekhar Sharma went viral.

4
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:15,660
You could see the excitement,

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,079
as he was celebrating Paytm's success.

6
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,874
He famously said,

7
00:00:20,874 --> 00:00:23,690
"Those who are not with us, will cry."

8
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:30,000
But sadly, 7 years later,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,278
the situation has completely changed.

10
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:36,269
Those who are with Paytm are crying.

11
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:40,406
Over the last few days, we saw 
a horrific crash of this company.

12
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:44,360
On 30th January, the stock price of this company was at ₹760.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,304
Today, it has fallen below ₹380.

14
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:49,151
What is the reason behind this?

15
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:53,284
Let's understand the rise and downfall of Paytm

16
00:00:53,284 --> 00:00:54,530
in this video.

17
00:01:02,788 --> 00:01:05,742
Paytm began its journey in 2010.

18
00:01:05,742 --> 00:01:09,866
But initially, it was just a mobile recharging platform.

19
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:11,540
An app through which you could

20
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,032
recharge your phone and pay landline bills.

21
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:18,402
The company gradually added more features to its app.

22
00:01:18,402 --> 00:01:20,424
It was only in January 2014 that

23
00:01:20,424 --> 00:01:22,239
Paytm Wallet was launched.

24
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,071
With this, you could pay online using Paytm.

25
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:32,892
By 2015, it was possible to pay for metro 
recharges, electricity, gas, and water bills.

26
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,521
But the real jump in the company's popularity

27
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:38,963
was seen only after 8th November 2016.

28
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:41,223
That day when demonetisation happened.

29
00:01:41,223 --> 00:01:44,842
"₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes

30
00:01:44,842 --> 00:01:50,257
will no longer be legal tender 
from midnight tonight."

31
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:52,030
The very next day after demonetisation,

32
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,680
the frontpage ads in many newspapers 
across the country looked like this.

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,939
"Paytm congratulates Honourable 
Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi

34
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,078
on taking the boldest decision

35
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:03,906
in the financial history of independent India.

36
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:06,008
Now, no ATMs, use Paytm."

37
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:08,584
The first controversy about Paytm was raised here.

38
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:10,025
People questioned whether

39
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:12,031
Paytm has any link with the government.

40
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,802
Using the Prime Minister's face in this way

41
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,860
while advertising their platform.

42
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,832
And the decision of demonetisation, 
which was said to be secretive,

43
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:22,814
was declared on 8th November at 8pm.

44
00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:25,138
So how did it happen that the very next day,

45
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:27,132
in the morning newspaper on 9th November,

46
00:02:27,132 --> 00:02:28,811
this was the front page ad?

47
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:32,051
Did this company already know that 
demonetisation was going to happen?

48
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,248
Whatever happened, one thing was clear.

49
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:38,299
Paytm benefited a lot from this decision.

50
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:40,826
According to Euro Money's report, before demonetisation,

51
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:44,321
Paytm had 125 million customers.

52
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:46,239
But only after 3 months of the demonetisation,

53
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,422
Paytm's had approx 185 million customers.

54
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:52,490
The CEO of this company, Vijay Shekhar Sharma,

55
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,311
did not miss the opportunity to capitalise on this opportunity.

56
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:58,050
Paytm hired more than 10,000 agents

57
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,626
to distribute their QR codes 
to local shops and vendors.

58
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:05,299
Shopkeepers were encouraged in every city

59
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:06,889
to use Paytm.

60
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:08,716
The company was growing tremendously.

61
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:10,077
But around this time,

62
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:11,839
there were 2-3 other controversies.

63
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:14,419
One was Paytm's Chinese link.

64
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:17,453
In 2015, a Chinese company named Alibaba

65
00:03:17,453 --> 00:03:20,429
invested $680 million in Paytm

66
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:23,659
and 40% stake in Paytm company

67
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,939
went to this Chinese company.

68
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,244
Alibaba's founder is Jack Ma

69
00:03:28,244 --> 00:03:30,480
and Vijay had said that he was his hero.

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,165
He had given a statement to the Financial Times newspaper.

71
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:35,686
"I became totally interested in China,

72
00:03:35,686 --> 00:03:38,189
Alibaba, and Jack - all three things."

73
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:41,080
You must be aware of the recent 
relations between India and China.

74
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,468
China is repeatedly intruding on the Indian border.

75
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:46,821
In 2017, the Doklam border standoff took place.

76
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:49,649
Many people had criticised Paytm for this.

77
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:52,496
Claiming that the company pretends to be a patriot

78
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:54,037
when they want to sell something.

79
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:56,370
But they have been taking Chinese funding secretly.

80
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,189
Because of this criticism,

81
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:00,925
the Chinese stake in the company was reduced

82
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:06,103
in 2023, Vijay transferred about 10% stake back to himself,

83
00:04:06,103 --> 00:04:10,956
and the Chinese stake in the company 
is around 13.5% as of now.

84
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:14,011
In May 2018, the next controversy arose regarding Paytm

85
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:16,730
when the investigative news agency CobraPost

86
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,290
conducted an undercover operation.

87
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,732
Their undercover reporter

88
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:22,495
went to meet the Vice President of Paytm, 
Ajay Shekhar Sharma,

89
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,490
Vijay Shekhar Sharma's brother.

90
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,348
When he was asked

91
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:30,332
if he would spread the propaganda 
of a political party through the app,

92
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:32,670
he happily accepted.

93
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,341
"There will be videos of Guruji too,

94
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,760
there are other things as well, 
I give those to you later..."

95
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,501
"We'll take care of all of that

96
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:38,989
if RSS tells us to.

97
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:41,307
Because loyalty to RSS runs in our blood."

98
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:42,873
He went on to say that

99
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:46,234
when the government asked them 
for the data of some Paytm users in J&K,

100
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:48,066
during the stone peltings,

101
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:50,326
they happily gave the data to the government.

102
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:52,366
"When our operations were shut down in J&K 

103
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:55,954
-due to the stones...
-The stone peltings, yes.

104
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:57,845
the PMO called us personally 

105
00:04:57,845 --> 00:04:59,331
asking us to hand over data to them,

106
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:00,716
of the Paytm users."

107
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:02,921
I made a video on this 6 years ago,

108
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:06,203
if you remember, 
if you are a veteran viewer of my channel.

109
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:09,059
But nothing significant happened with these controversies.

110
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,294
The company kept growing very fast.

111
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:12,876
Generally speaking,

112
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:14,295
there are many companies who

113
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:15,578
don't care about your data.

114
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:18,676
They sell your data to other companies.

115
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:20,380
Especially online, it happens a lot.

116
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,807
Your data is used to create a digital profile

117
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:26,350
so that you can be shown online targeted ads.

118
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,544
A good way to avoid this is to use VPN.

119
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:32,463
A VPN encrypts your internet traffic.

120
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:34,711
In my opinion, one of the best VPN apps

121
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:35,761
is NordVPN,

122
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:37,446
which is also the sponsor of this video.

123
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:39,416
One of the advantages of using NordVPN is that

124
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:42,454
you can use it for content streaming.

125
00:05:42,454 --> 00:05:47,327
If a specific show, movie or video 
is banned in your location,

126
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:49,349
you can bypass these restrictions

127
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,695
by setting your location somewhere else through VPN.

128
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:53,775
Recently, due to increasing customer demand,

129
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:56,967
NordVPN has added a server in India.

130
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:59,872
This is a virtual location server with Indian IP.

131
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:03,514
And when you browse the internet with a VPN,

132
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:05,862
your data is secure.

133
00:06:05,862 --> 00:06:08,885
You can't be tracked online by other companies.

134
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:12,142
If you are interested, check out NordVPN.com/Dhruv

135
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:14,467

if you use this link to subscribe to NordVPN.

It's a risk-free offer

139
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:22,867
they give a 30-day money-back guarantee.

140
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:24,818
So, NordVPN.com/Dhruv

141
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,765
You can find this link in the description below.

142
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:28,722
Now, let's get back to the topic.

143
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,279
In 2017, Paytm launched Paytm Payments Bank.

144
00:06:36,795 --> 00:06:39,678
They started offering banking services.

145
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:42,550
Payments Bank is like a bank to some extent.

146
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,452
You can create a bank account,

147
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:47,204
deposit money, and get a debit card.

148
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:49,874
But compared to a normal commercial bank,

149
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:51,955
there are some important differences.

150
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:55,239
Payments banks focus mostly on digital services.

151
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,762
There are very few 
physical branches of payments banks.

152
00:06:57,762 --> 00:06:59,295
And according to RBI's Rules,

153
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:03,136
payments banks cannot offer 
credit card and loan services.

154
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:07,130
Normal commercial banks 
like HDFC, SBI, ICICI,

155
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,969
do not have any deposit limit.

156
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:12,067
You can deposit as much as you want in those banks.

157
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,363
But RBI has prescribed a limit for payments banks.

158
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:19,578
You cannot deposit more than ₹200,000 in these banks.

159
00:07:19,578 --> 00:07:21,805
I am telling you all this in detail because

160
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,815
the current state of Paytm

161
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:26,665
is largely caused by Paytm's Payments Bank.

162
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:28,747
RBI, the Reserve Bank of India,

163
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:29,959
is the central bank of the country.

164
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,173
It decides the monetary policy of the country

165
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:34,632
and also works to print money.

166
00:07:34,632 --> 00:07:37,907
All the banks and financial institutions in the country

167
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:41,777
have to follow the rules and 
guidelines prescribed by the RBI.

168
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:44,053
So on 31st January 2024,

169
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:45,766
the Paytm crash

170
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,668
happened because the RBI

171
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,465
imposed operational restrictions 
on Paytm's Payments Bank.

172
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:53,964
RBI said that Paytm's Payments Bank

173
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:56,145
kept violating our rules repeatedly.

174
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:59,728
There was 'persistent non-compliance' by them.

175
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:02,601
And that's why RBI put restrictions on the bank.

176
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:04,543
After 29th February 2024,

177
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:08,409
Paytm's Payments Bank can't accept any new deposits.

178
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:10,979
There can't be money top-ups in customer accounts.

179
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,686
New customers can't be on-boarded.

180
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:15,774
And RBI said that all the nodal accounts

181
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:17,973
with this Paytm Payments Bank

182
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:21,620
should be closed by 15th March 2024.

183
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,273
Nodal accounts are those accounts

184
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:26,563
which are used by e-commerce and online services businesses.

185
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:28,839
And as far as Paytm Wallet is concerned,

186
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,914
you can use your existing balance

187
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:32,493
but after 29th February,

188
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:34,434
you can't deposit any more money in it.

189
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:38,094
So, obviously, this is a major decision by the RBI.

190
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:40,422
And such decisions are not taken in a jiffy.

191
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:42,782
It's not like RBI randomly decided one day

192
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:44,674
to take action on Paytm

193
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:45,788
and implemented these decisions.

194
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:48,688
In fact, there is a very long history behind this.

195
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:51,172
The truth is that Paytm was time and again

196
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:53,736
warned by the RBI for years,

197
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:55,186
but it still didn't rectify its actions.

198
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:56,835
In November 2017,

199
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:58,984
Paytm's Payments Bank was launched

200
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:00,711
and in June 2018,

201
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:02,781
RBI issued the first warning.

202
00:09:02,781 --> 00:09:04,584
An audit found that Paytm

203
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:07,711
was not following the anti-money 
laundering regulations properly.

204
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:11,510
And the identity of the customers 
who made their accounts with their bank

205
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,089
was not being verified properly by Paytm.

206
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:16,013
The KYC, or Know Your Customer compliance 

207
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,112
wasn't adhered to by Paytm.

208
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:22,472
So RBI told Paytm to stop onboarding new customers

209
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:24,745
until it fixes all these issues.

210
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:27,018
Paytm took some action regarding this warning

211
00:09:27,018 --> 00:09:28,599
because in January 2019,

212
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:33,551
RBI allowed Paytm to resume onboarding customers.

213
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:35,309
The restrictions were removed.

214
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,058
But after 2.5 years, in October 2021,

215
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:39,388
came the next big shock.

216
00:09:39,388 --> 00:09:42,016
A fine of ₹10 million was imposed on Paytm.

217
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,811
Because while filling in their licence application,

218
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:47,699
they submitted incorrect information and documents.

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,615
The issues that RBI had flagged before

220
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,788
customers not being verified properly,

221
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:55,983
regulations are not being followed properly,

222
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:57,799
the same issues were seen again.

223
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,978
Once again, customer onboarding had to be stopped.

224
00:10:00,978 --> 00:10:04,663
In October 2023, another huge fine was imposed on Paytm

225
00:10:04,663 --> 00:10:06,530
this time, it amounted to ₹50 million.

226
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,934
RBI hoped that after 2 warnings and 2 fines,

227
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:14,344
Paytm would meet the regulatory requirements

228
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:17,277
and start verifying its customers properly.

229
00:10:17,277 --> 00:10:18,585
But even after all this,

230
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,793
Paytm did not take these seriously.

231
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:23,495
And for this reason, on 31st January 2024,

232
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:25,666
RBI had to take concrete steps.

233
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,214
Since Paytm could not follow 
the rules and regulations properly,

234
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:29,182
RBI had to stop its operations.

235
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:31,824
RBI's findings were very shocking.

236
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:33,379
According to CNBC,

237
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:37,784
Paytm allowed hundreds of thousands of 
customers to open bank accounts with them

238
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:39,414
without proper KYC documentation.

239
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:41,513
There were thousands of cases where

240
00:10:41,513 --> 00:10:44,453
thousands of customers 
had opened multiple accounts

241
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:46,271
using the same PAN card.

242
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,451
In some accounts, transactions were worth

243
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:49,660
millions of rupees.

244
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,542
Here, the risk of potential money laundering was evident.

245
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:55,376
It is possible that money laundering 
was taking place through Paytm.

246
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:57,762
Outlook reported that according to an analyst,

247
00:10:57,762 --> 00:11:00,110
Paytm had around 350 million wallets.

248
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,933
Of which around 310 million wallets are inactive,

249
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:04,988
no one is using these.

250
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:07,109
And in the remaining 40 million wallets,

251
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:11,086
most of them have no balance or very little balance.

252
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:14,935
Because of this, they can be used like mule accounts.

253
00:11:15,219 --> 00:11:16,776
A Mule account is an account

254
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,681
that is used for illegal activities,

255
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:21,080
like money laundering.

256
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,617
After this, there are concerns about data privacy too.

257
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,974
RBI said that Paytm's parent company,

258
00:11:25,974 --> 00:11:28,002
One97 Communications Ltd,

259
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:32,729
there is no operational segregation 
between it and Paytm Payments Bank.

260
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:34,921
There was cash flow between the two,

261
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,617
which was not disclosed in the financial statements.

262
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:41,132
So many rules and regulations were ignored.

263
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:46,262
Is the arrogance of their CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma 
responsible for this to some extent?

264
00:11:46,262 --> 00:11:48,493
He gave many interviews to media channels

265
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:51,495
this arrogance was seen in his words in those interviews.

266
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:54,814
"If you fundamentally believe 
that Paytm is #3 payment player,

267
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,672
that is where the beginning of the problem is

268
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:57,340
in understanding."

269
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,888
"I'm surprised that people don't know this

270
00:11:58,888 --> 00:11:59,734
in this country, but

271
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:01,131
we make profit, so it is."

272
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:02,579
"Somebody who has not met us

273
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:03,720
and has an opinion on us

274
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,756
is not my opinion

275
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:05,819
to keep an opinion on that."

276
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,304
After RBI's announcement on 31st January,

277
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:09,599
a commotion broke out.

278
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,657
People started taking out 
the money they had invested in Paytm.

279
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:17,210
So, Paytm's stock crashed very fast.

280
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,906
To calm people down,

281
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,863
Paytm posted on its social media handles that

282
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:23,429
there was nothing wrong.

283
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:26,237
On 2nd February, Vijay Shekhar Sharma tweeted this.

284
00:12:26,237 --> 00:12:27,355
"To every Paytmer,

285
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:28,738
Your favourite app is working,

286
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:31,372
will keep working beyond 29th February as usual...

287
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:33,456
For every challenge, there is a solution

288
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:35,654
and we are sincerely committed to serve our nation

289
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,530
in full compliance. 

290
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,867
India will keep winning global accolades 

291
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:41,637
in payment innovation and 
inclusion in financial services." 

292
00:12:41,843 --> 00:12:43,449
As you can see, once again,

293
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:45,675
patriotism was used as a shield here.

294
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:47,237
'Don't see us as a company,

295
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:49,077
see us as patriots serving the nation.'

296
00:12:49,077 --> 00:12:51,165
Using India as the shield

297
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:52,843
Paytm tried to hide behind it.

298
00:12:52,843 --> 00:12:54,652
This reminds me of a quote.

299
00:12:54,652 --> 00:12:58,049
"Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel."

300
00:12:58,049 --> 00:12:59,429
You must have heard this quote.

301
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:03,087
In my opinion, we should be wary of such companies

302
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:05,636
which rely too heavily on nationalism.

303
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:08,593
A few years ago, there was a phone Freedom 251.

304
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:11,071
They printed India's national flag on the back of the phone.

305
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:14,410
It was sold as the 'world's cheapest phone'

306
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,666
but it turned out to be a big scam.

307
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,253
If a company's products and services

308
00:13:18,253 --> 00:13:19,404
have intrinsic value,

309
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:21,749
they sell it by promoting those values.

310
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:25,572
But if they don't have much to say 
about their products or services,

311
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,385
then patriotism is used as a selling point.

312
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,349
Urging you to buy their product

313
00:13:30,349 --> 00:13:31,384
just because they are Indian.

314
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:32,943
Because they are an Indian company,

315
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:34,609
they use it as the only reason 
why you should buy their product.

316
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:36,251
Anyways, if we come back to Paytm,

317
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:38,601
the question is, what will happen next?

318
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:40,321
Internally, the employees of the company

319
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,260
are facing a lot of uncertainty.

320
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,134
They are not getting much clarity from the leadership

321
00:13:44,134 --> 00:13:45,429
about what will happen next.

322
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,014
Economic Times reported that

323
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:49,094
an executive of the company told them that

324
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,768
their business model might change.

325
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:53,318
Now, instead of being a bank,

326
00:13:53,318 --> 00:13:55,597
they might try to become a third-party payments app.

327
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:58,286
So they will have to change 
some things on the back end.

328
00:13:58,286 --> 00:14:00,705
And they will have to make the change in a limited time.

329
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:02,553
If you look at Paytm's annual report,

330
00:14:02,553 --> 00:14:05,599
to check how much has it earned each year,

331
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,528
you will see that it has always been

332
00:14:07,528 --> 00:14:09,375
a loss-making company since

333
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,396
its shares were listed on the stock market.

334
00:14:11,396 --> 00:14:12,393
Look at this chart,

335
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,968
in FY 2021, the company incurred a loss of ₹16 billion.

336
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:18,724
In FY 2022, a loss of ₹15 billion.

337
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:22,364
In FY 2023, a loss of ₹1.7 billion.

338
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:24,141
The good news was that year after year

339
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:26,501
the company's losses were decreasing.

340
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:28,468
So, it could have been expected that next year,

341
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,593
that is, this year, in FY 2024,

342
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:32,899
the company would earn its first profit.

343
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:35,702
But now, after everything that has happened,

344
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:36,903
it seems difficult.

345
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:38,978
The company expects that this year,

346
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,840
the company's loss could increase by ₹3 billion to ₹5 billion.

347
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,721
Paytm has revealed this to the public,

348
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:48,025
saying that they will now comply 
with the guidelines issued by RBI.

349
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:49,929
But after this announcement,

350
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,953
the company's stock price fell further.

351
00:14:51,953 --> 00:14:54,031
"What is the path to profitability Vijay?

352
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:56,877
What is... by when will Paytm make money?"

353
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:59,250
"Make more money? 
By making more money.

354
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,781
By making more money!"

355
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,977
Vijay Shekhar Sharma will have to come up 
with better answers to these questions

356
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:06,957
if he wants to convince people.

357
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:08,714
Actually, convincing people

358
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:12,187
will be the biggest challenge for Paytm.

359
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:15,732
An average person is very picky about choosing a company.

360
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:18,381
And public's trust plays an important role here.

361
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:20,298
Once people choose their toothpaste,

362
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:24,649
they decide that they will use 
that company's toothpaste forever.

363
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:26,437
They don't change their mind easily.

364
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:29,309
Here, they will be more cautious as this 
involves their money and banking abilities. 

365
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:31,299
Bringing customers back

366
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:33,331
won't be easy for Paytm.

367
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:35,462
But convincing customers will come later.

368
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:38,200
First, Paytm will have to convince RBI.

369
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,754
That won't be an easy task.

370
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:40,925
But there is light at the end of the tunnel,

371
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:43,543
a way to get out of this can be 

372
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,220
to have another company

373
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,372
buy Paytm's wallet business.

374
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:49,591
A Business Standard report suggests that

375
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:52,488
HDFC Bank and Jio Financial Services

376
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:54,549
might just do this.

377
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:56,847
But Jio has denied this speculation

378
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:59,179
saying that they have no intention of doing so.

379
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:02,256
And anyway, before executing such a sale,

380
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:04,083
they'd need RBI's approval.

381
00:16:04,393 --> 00:16:05,699
If you liked this video,

382
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,635
I have done similar case studies on other companies

383
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,238
like this one on Amul.

384
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:13,860
What is the secret behind 
the success of companies like Amul?

385
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,251
