1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,999
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,999 --> 00:00:02,828
You may not have even dreamed

3
00:00:02,828 --> 00:00:05,140
that technology will reach this level.

4
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,169
Watch this video.

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,899
Can you guess which place is shown in this drone footage?

6
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:13,311
Which country is it shot in?

7
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:14,665
Whatever your guess may be,

8
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:15,648
it is wrong.

9
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,695
Because this video is neither of a real place

10
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:19,209
nor has it been taken by any drone.

11
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:22,226
This is a video made by Artificial Intelligence.

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,493
All these videos on the screen

13
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:28,978
all of them are fake.

14
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:38,596
This man wearing a cap 
or this man reading a book,

15
00:00:38,596 --> 00:00:40,610
these people don't exist in reality.

16
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,753
They have been generated by the computer.

17
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:45,276
Now it is almost impossible to tell the difference

18
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:46,579
between what is real

19
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,682
and what is computer generated.

20
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:49,623
And now, to make videos,

21
00:00:49,623 --> 00:00:51,088
you don't need a camera.

22
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:54,159
You can make such videos with only a keyboard,

23
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,610
in a matter of minutes.

24
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,465
All of this has become possible today,

25
00:00:57,465 --> 00:00:59,532
because of Sora AI.

26
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,648
"A new AI platform called Sora."

27
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:03,852
"You can't hide from these changes."

28
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:06,318
"No country, no economy."

29
00:01:08,038 --> 00:01:10,304
Sora AI is an Artificial Intelligence software,

30
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,138
developed by OpenAI.

31
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:16,166
The same company which shook the world 1.5 years ago

32
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,265
when they launched ChatGPT.

33
00:01:18,265 --> 00:01:22,082
In ChatGPT, you have a text-to-text conversation with AI.

34
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,133
You write something in text and send it to AI

35
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:26,213
and the answer is generated in text.

36
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:29,214
After this, OpenAI launched the DALL-E software

37
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,770
which was text-to-photo.

38
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,245
You wrote a text prompt

39
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:34,658
and the type of photo you wanted to generate

40
00:01:34,658 --> 00:01:38,225
and you got an AI-generated photo.

41
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:40,995
And now this Sora AI is a text-to-video.

42
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:43,387
Now you simply have to write in simple English

43
00:01:43,387 --> 00:01:45,919
about the kind of video you want to generate.

44
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,590
And it will do that for you.

45
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,779
Like, if you say,

46
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:50,562
"I want a video of a young person

47
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:52,792
who is reading a book while sitting on a cloud."

48
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:54,034
Write this prompt

49
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:58,309
and in response, Sora AI will 
make a video like this in a few minutes.

50
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:01,235
The videos I have showed you,

51
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:03,697
text prompts were written to generate each of them.

52
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:05,173
Some of them were generated by a long text prompt,

53
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:06,299
while others had a short prompt.

54
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,458
But Sora AI can not only generate text-to-video,

55
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,908
but also photo-to-video.

56
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:13,979
This is a photo of a Shiba Inu dog.

57
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:16,253
If you input this photo into Sora AI,

58
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:17,859
this video is generated.

59
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:20,958
Not only that, it is also possible to do video-to-video.

60
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,805
Give it the original video here,

61
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:24,728
where a car is driving on the road.

62
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,522
And if you tell it to change the environment around it.

63
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,835
Like, you want it to look like the 1920s.

64
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:33,126
While keeping the car red coloured.

65
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,223
So this video is generated from the original video.

66
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,778
Do you understand what this technology means?

67
00:02:38,778 --> 00:02:41,595
Entire industries can turn upside down.

68
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,430
Animators, Video Game Designers,

69
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,710
Graphic Designers,

70
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,175
what is the need for them now?

71
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:48,677
Stock photo platforms, stock video platforms

72
00:02:48,677 --> 00:02:50,013
will be completely destroyed.

73
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:52,838
Why do you need to film for weeks for making movies,

74
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:56,706
when in a few minutes AI can give you footage for the movie?

75
00:02:57,088 --> 00:03:00,298
We will talk about how this will affect the world later in the video,

76
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:02,188
but before that, I would like to tell you

77
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:05,693
about the level of this technology 
before the arrival of Sora AI.

78
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:07,173
Exactly one year ago,

79
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:08,197
in March 2023,

80
00:03:08,197 --> 00:03:10,123
this video went viral on the internet.

81
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,317
Will Smith eating spaghetti.

82
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,611
This video was made using AI software of another company,

83
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:18,498
but a year ago, this was the peak of this technology.

84
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:22,263
After this, some other text-to-video AI tools were released to the public,

85
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:24,664
like Pika Labs and Runway.

86
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:26,082
Before the arrival of Sora AI,

87
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:28,526
Runway was an industry leader in this field,

88
00:03:28,526 --> 00:03:32,079
but look at the quality of AI-generated videos generated by it.

89
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,954
There is a vast difference.

90
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,865
After Sora's release,

91
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:38,396
actor Will Smith was so impressed with this technology

92
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:40,472
that he made a video of himself

93
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:41,624
eating spaghetti as a joke.

94
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:44,622
To show the level of technology before

95
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:46,537
and after the launch of Sora.

96
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:51,261
Sora can now understand

97
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:53,003
how our world works,

98
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:54,363
how motion works

99
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:55,900
according to the laws of physics.

100
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,337
This is the reason why,
when the puppies are moving in this video,

101
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:01,994
it knows how the snow on their heads should move.

102
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:04,214
It is now able to understand emotions too.

103
00:04:04,214 --> 00:04:05,243
Watch this video.

104
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:07,605
When this cartoon sees this candle burning,

105
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:10,296
you can see the excitement play on its face.

106
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:12,906
Sora is able to understand even the smallest details

107
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:14,678
like how elephants walk,

108
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:17,204
the exact motion of their feet,

109
00:04:17,204 --> 00:04:21,087
this is why these videos look so real to us.

110
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:22,402
You might be wondering about

111
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:23,958
how Sora is able to do all of it.

112
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,757
So, its basic functionality

113
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:28,503
is actually very similar to ChatGPT's.

114
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:31,294
Where on one hand, ChatGPT uses tokens

115
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:35,449
on the other hand, Sora uses patches, its equivalent.

116
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:37,402
Whatever you ask ChatGPT,

117
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,480
it divides the text in tokens

118
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,946
and it generates its answer through tokens.

119
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:43,481
Similarly, Sora AI

120
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:45,532
tries to understand photos and videos,

121
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:49,028
by dividing the visual data into visual patches.

122
00:04:49,464 --> 00:04:51,306
And even while creating its output,

123
00:04:51,306 --> 00:04:54,559
it uses these visual patches to make the video.

124
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:59,387
I explained this process in detail in my ChatGPT course,

125
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:00,990
about what exactly are tokens

126
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,304
and how they work.

127
00:05:02,304 --> 00:05:03,811
If you have taken the course,

128
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:06,274
then refer to the explanation in Chapter 2.3,

129
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:09,257
the visual patches can be understood as an equivalent of tokens.

130
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:11,508
And if you have not taken the course yet,

131
00:05:11,508 --> 00:05:12,818
then do check it out,

132
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:14,989
because this technology is changing the world.

133
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:16,545
It is disrupting industries.

134
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:17,995
If you don't learn about this,

135
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:19,616
if you don't use it in your daily life,

136
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:20,793
you will be left behind.

137
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:23,217
The first two chapters of the course are quite theoretical,

138
00:05:23,217 --> 00:05:25,064
in which I explain the concepts behind it.

139
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:27,349
What is the technology behind ChatGPT?

140
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:28,962
How do tokens work?

141
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,018
What is temperature?

142
00:05:30,018 --> 00:05:31,527
What is the RLHF method?

143
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:33,871
But the useful things begin in Chapter 3,

144
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:35,502
These are the practical lessons.

145
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,370
In Chapter 3, you will learn how to use it in your studies.

146
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,283
For example, if you want to go study abroad,

147
00:05:40,283 --> 00:05:43,022
you don't need to waste money on a consultant.

148
00:05:43,022 --> 00:05:44,422
Use ChatGPT.

149
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:47,532
For example, you can use it to practice for a job interview.

150
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:49,725
Chapter 4 is focused on personal life.

151
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:54,189
How can you use it in food, diet planning, 
health and fitness, and travel planning?

152
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,458
Chapter 5 is my favourite.

153
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,627
It is focused on business owners and entrepreneurs.

154
00:05:57,627 --> 00:06:00,639
For example, you can do market research 
and analysis for your business

155
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,107
through ChatGPT.

156
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:04,860
You can use it for Customer Feedback Management.

157
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,418
Chapter 6 talks about ChatGPT's limitations.

158
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:10,059
And now, there is a Chapter 7 for you.

159
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:12,438
It's a Bonus Content of an hour-long workshop 

160
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:15,022
that I hosted in Dubai's 1 Billion Summit.

161
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:18,934
In this workshop, I taught the attendees 
how to use ChatGPT's full potential.

162
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:19,950
But not only this,

163
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,369
in April 2024,

164
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:23,527
I will add another major update to this course.

165
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:25,422
There will be new chapters and new lessons

166
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:27,760
because this technology is changing so fast

167
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,780
and if you buy this course once,

168
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,629
all future updates are free for you.

169
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,031
So if you are interested in joining,

170
00:06:33,031 --> 00:06:35,373
there is a special discount for you in this video.

171
00:06:35,373 --> 00:06:36,819
You will get 40% off.

172
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:38,366
if you are on of the first 400 people

173
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:42,164
to use the coupon code SORA40

174
00:06:42,164 --> 00:06:43,988
You can get the link from the description below

175
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,560
or you can scan this QR code.

176
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,012
Now if let's get back to Sora,

177
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:50,321
at the first glance, you will definitely feel that

178
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:52,720
this technology has reached perfection.

179
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,480
But if you look at it closely,

180
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,411
you will see that it is not 100% perfect yet.

181
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:59,535
No doubt this is a great technology,

182
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:00,960
it is absolutely unbeatable,

183
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,146
but not yet 100% perfect.

184
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,267
Why am I saying this?

185
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:06,555
Because in the videos I showed you,

186
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:08,429
look at them carefully.

187
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:10,239
The man who is reading the book,

188
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:14,554
look at how the wind is moving 
the pages of this book in the wrong direction.

189
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,473
The astronaut that's walking,

190
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:19,312
look at how his walking speed increases suddenly.

191
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,569
Open AI openly acknowledges the 
weaknesses of Sora AI on its website.

192
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,271
These AI-generated videos

193
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:30,252
sometimes fail to apply the physics of the real world.

194
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:31,393
Like this basketball,

195
00:07:31,393 --> 00:07:33,558
which is passing through the hoop.

196
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,171
Or the three hands seen in this video.

197
00:07:36,444 --> 00:07:39,865
Or this video of a grandma celebrating her birthday,

198
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:42,201
it may seem like everything is fine first,

199
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:44,088
but look at it carefully.

200
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,290
How are the people reacting?

201
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,639
Look at it more carefully.

202
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,230
Did you find the mistake?

203
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,304
Then look more carefully.

204
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:53,696
The way people are waving their hands in the background.

205
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:56,629
No normal person waves their hand like this.

206
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:59,124
So, today, these are the minor details

207
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:01,149
based on which it is possible to detect

208
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:02,715
if a video is AI-generated

209
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,217
or a video taken in real life.

210
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:08,898
But the speed with which this technology is improving,

211
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:11,603
I don't think that one year later,

212
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:13,443
it would be possible to detect this anymore.

213
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:15,750
And the people in OpenAI know this,

214
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,445
the day these videos become so real that

215
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:22,397
no human eye will be able to differentiate between these,

216
00:08:22,397 --> 00:08:24,672
that day, huge problems will be created.

217
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:27,315
Fake news would be spread so easily.

218
00:08:27,315 --> 00:08:29,421
Perhaps, this is the reason why Sora AI

219
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:31,786
is not released to the public yet.

220
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:35,068
It is being tested by Red Teamers for security concerns.

221
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:37,033
This means that it is in the testing phase.

222
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,817
Red Teamers refers to those people from Cyber Security

223
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,596
who behave like attackers.

224
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,549
Their job is to find the system's weaknesses.

225
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:46,967
But even when it would be released to the public,

226
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:52,337
I don't think it would be possible to 
manipulate photos and videos of any real person

227
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:55,010
because that will always be a major security risk

228
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,932
of people using it

229
00:08:56,932 --> 00:08:59,236
to make fake videos of any politician

230
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:01,874
and that could cause election interference.

231
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:06,379
But this is a thing that is becoming a 
big problem even before Sora is released.

232
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,765
Watch this video.

233
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:09,331
This is a video of Virat Kohli in which

234
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,333
he is promoting a betting app.

235
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,928
"*** is a type of game

236
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,720
which can be called an investment-worthy app.

237
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,489
Or I can call it an investment-worthy game.

238
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,164
In which you can spend a little money

239
00:09:18,164 --> 00:09:19,837
to get maximum winnings."

240
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:21,879
Could you recognise that this wasn't a real video?

241
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,609
This is a 100% AI-generated video.

242
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:27,955
Some fraud companies have already started exploiting this.

243
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:32,250
Celebrities' faces are used to run these ads on social media.

244
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,755
People are lured with money,

245
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:36,199
and told to download their app.

246
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:38,633
The same thing happened to Sachin Tendulkar.

247
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:40,750
"My daughter is playing this game now,

248
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,785
everyone is talking about it,

249
00:09:42,785 --> 00:09:44,006
***.

250
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,898
She plays games on the ***** app,

251
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:49,382
and earns ₹180,000 every day."

252
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,170
Another completely fake video,

253
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,291
but did you see that

254
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,837
the technology has reached the level where

255
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:58,049
it is possible to use someone else's voice.

256
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:00,582
For now, there is only one way to avoid such videos,

257
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:02,642
watching these videos carefully.

258
00:10:02,642 --> 00:10:05,110
You will always find small mistakes.

259
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,911
Somewhere, the lip movement will be strange.

260
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:09,635
The quality of such videos will be low.

261
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:11,956
If you try to listen to the voice carefully,

262
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:13,190
you will find that

263
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,899
the voice is not like the original.

264
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:17,261
It seems like an artificially synthesised voice.

265
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:19,240
Listen to Sachin Tendulkar's voice again.

266
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,564
"My daughter is playing this game now,

267
00:10:21,564 --> 00:10:23,702
and everyone is talking about it."

268
00:10:23,702 --> 00:10:27,097
You can differentiate by noticing the small details,

269
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:28,417
but most importantly,

270
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:30,301
look at the video content.

271
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:31,915
What is being promoted in the video?

272
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:33,602
What are you being told to do?

273
00:10:33,602 --> 00:10:35,366
"This application is absolutely free,

274
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:37,484
any iPhone owner can download it."

275
00:10:38,002 --> 00:10:42,429
"The plane flies at 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X, etc."

276
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:45,041
If a celebrity tells you to download any app

277
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:48,782
where you can make 10 times the money you spend on it,

278
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,686
this should alert you.

279
00:10:50,686 --> 00:10:52,852
Whether it is an AI video or a real video,

280
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,843
you should stay away from such things.

281
00:10:54,843 --> 00:10:58,525
Apart from this, a technological solution 
can also be created for these problems.

282
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,452
An AI whose job is to

283
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,403
identify AI-generated videos.

284
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:05,794
OpenAI has said that the videos generated by SoraAI,

285
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:07,401
would have a watermark on them.

286
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:09,455
With that watermark, you can always identify whether

287
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:12,149
a video is AI-generated or not.

288
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:17,374
Personally, I use AI-generated photos or videos often in my videos.

289
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:21,056
In such cases, in the top right corner of the video, I always write 

290
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,502
Representational.

291
00:11:22,502 --> 00:11:25,258
You must have seen this written 
in the corner of my videos often.

292
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:27,555
This is so that you can understand

293
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:30,209
that the photo or video on the screen

294
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:32,443
is not real, it is AI-generated.

295
00:11:32,716 --> 00:11:35,112
But an even bigger issue is the jobs.

296
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:39,166
What will be the impact of this AI 
on industries and economies globally?

297
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:44,459
Even in films, filmmakers will not have to 
carry big cameras and film in different places.

298
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,870
In a few years, entire films can be made using AI.

299
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,470
Last year, the director of the Avengers films, 
Joe Russo, famously said that

300
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,736
it will take only 2 years

301
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:56,304
for AI to reach the level where

302
00:11:56,304 --> 00:11:58,172
it can start producing entire films.

303
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:00,803
Similarly, it will have a huge impact on the gaming industry.

304
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,405
The video games that took years to make,

305
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:07,020
needed teams of more than 100 people.

306
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,630
How easily the same tasks can be done with this.

307
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,927
According to this NBC article,

308
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:14,881
filmmaker Tyler Perry was going to spend $800 million

309
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:16,748
to expand his studio.

310
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:18,582
But as soon as Sora was released,

311
00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:20,749
he stopped his studio expansion.

312
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:22,752
After all, what is the need for a studio

313
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:25,494
if AI makes videos for us?

314
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,807
This means that many jobs across different industries,

315
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:29,788
are at risk of being eliminated.

316
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:34,691
The cinematographer who needed many days 
to make 2-minute long stock footage,

317
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:36,328
and earned money by selling them,

318
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:38,421
or the VFX artist

319
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:42,075
who made the NPCs for major gaming companies.

320
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:45,910
In the short term, the jobs related to film 
and video production, advertising, and marketing

321
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,020
will be affected the most.

322
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,872
But at the same time, there is a positive side to it.

323
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:51,592
The good thing will be that

324
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:54,162
we will see democratisation in all these fields.

325
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:57,759
These fields will become more accessible to the common people.

326
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,601
If your dream was to become a film producer,

327
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:03,973
but you didn't have the money or the equipment,

328
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:07,372
now you will get the opportunity to show your creativity through Sora AI

329
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:09,183
without these resources.

330
00:13:09,183 --> 00:13:12,296
Now even an IT employee will get the 
opportunity to become a good filmmaker

331
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:17,139
and a musician will get the opportunity to 
make music videos without spending a lot.

332
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,143
Looking at such technologies,

333
00:13:20,143 --> 00:13:22,241
it is understandable to be a little scared of them.

334
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:24,336
Do you know, friends, that 600 years ago,

335
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,334
when the printing press was invented,

336
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:29,863
many religious leaders were opposing it.

337
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:31,340
Some people used to say that

338
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,934
the books are actually given to us by the devil.

339
00:13:33,934 --> 00:13:35,785
That books should be banned.

340
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:39,431
In 1501, the Pope, 
Pope Alexander VI

341
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:42,300
said that without the permission of the Church,

342
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,261
no onw was allowed to print books.

343
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:45,653
One thing is clear here,

344
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:47,674
whether you like this technology or not,

345
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:49,259
it cannot be ignored.

346
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:51,519
All people and all governments

347
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,844
have to learn to adapt to this new world.

348
00:13:53,844 --> 00:13:57,468
Many governments around the world 
have already started taking proactive steps.

349
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:59,029
Like, in Singapore's Parliament,

350
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:01,163
recently one of their MPs

351
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:04,046
gave this speech on Sora AI a few days ago.

352
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:20,725
The politician's name is Tan Wu Meng.

353
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:22,612
He said that the Singapore government

354
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:27,255
has now launched a new subsidy 
to adapt to the new AI developments.

355
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,363
This subsidy is for people above 40 years of age

356
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:49,095
so that they can pursue a full-time diploma once again.

357
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:11,222
Because their government has understood that

358
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:15,072
today, if you study something in a college or university,

359
00:15:15,072 --> 00:15:16,983
whatever you are being taught today,

360
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:22,859
will it still be relevant 20 years later 
after technology transforms so drastically?

361
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:27,862
So it is better to tell people to 
educate themselves again after 40 years.

362
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:30,816
To be able to adapt to the new developments,

363
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:32,608
by upskilling themselves.

364
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:34,566
Interestingly, the government of Singapore

365
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,454
had started talking about AI in 2019.

366
00:15:37,454 --> 00:15:39,268
And in the latest budget for 2024,

367
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:43,117
they have pledged to invest $1 billion in AI.

368
00:15:43,117 --> 00:15:45,907
"In the National AI Strategy 2.0,

369
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:49,840
I will invest more than $1 Billion, over the next 5 years,

370
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,614
into AI computing, talent, and industry development." 

371
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:55,428
So, this will be my suggestion to you.

372
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,937
The sooner you learn to adapt to this changing world,

373
00:15:57,937 --> 00:16:00,226
the more benefits will you reap.

374
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,289
But I would like to say one more thing about AI,

375
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:05,320
since 'AI' has become a very trendy word nowadays,

376
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,343
many companies are exploiting it

377
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:11,387
and there are many useless AIs present in the market today.

378
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:14,046
When I made my first video on AI,

379
00:16:14,046 --> 00:16:15,956
at the beginning of that video, I showed you many things

380
00:16:15,956 --> 00:16:18,158
that could be done through AI.

381
00:16:18,158 --> 00:16:19,562
Like changing your face,

382
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,205
changing your voice.

383
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:22,524
"And if I want,

384
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:26,054
I can also change my voice with the help of AI."

385
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:29,599
But after taking my course, 
many of you gave me the feedback 

386
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:32,131
asking me why I made a course only on ChatGPT.

387
00:16:32,131 --> 00:16:34,640
Why didn't I talk about the other AIs in the course?

388
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,497
This is why.

389
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:38,962
Most of the other AIs are just for vanity.

390
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:40,936
They have no practical use in life.

391
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,417
Like during the face swap,

392
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,392
when I changed my face to Tom Cruise's and Hrithik Roshan's

393
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:47,610
I used a tool called Akool Face Swap.

394
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,206
It was an expensive tool,

395
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:53,514
I had spent a lot of money just to get 
the output of a few seconds of footage.

396
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,236
The result was not that good either,

397
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:57,503
because you could clearly look at me and say that

398
00:16:57,503 --> 00:16:59,592
the face looks manipulated,

399
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:00,874
it doesn't look real.

400
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:03,001
And there were no other features in it.

401
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,869
That's why such AI tools are called Gimmicks.

402
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:08,474
They are used only for show-off.

403
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:10,998
But these won't help you in your studies,

404
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:12,885
nor will it improve your efficiency,

405
00:17:12,885 --> 00:17:14,646
and nor will it help you with your business.

406
00:17:14,646 --> 00:17:17,583
That's why I focused the most on ChatGPT.

407
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,257
Because ChatGPT is actually life-changing.

408
00:17:20,257 --> 00:17:24,577
ChatGPT can be used practically in many aspects of our lives.

409
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,342
That's why the entire course focuses on it.

410
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:29,151
And recently, many Indian AI companies have popped up,

411
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:32,031
claiming to have made the first Indian AI,

412
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:33,128
that is later found to be

413
00:17:33,128 --> 00:17:37,066
using ChatGPT in the base, at the back end.

414
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:40,056
Apart from ChatGPT, 
Midjourney, DALL-E and Stable Diffusion

415
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:42,944
are the three text-to-photo AI software

416
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:44,609
that are actually useful.

417
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:46,097
And I think, in the near future,

418
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:48,839
Sora AI will be as revolutionary

419
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,148
as ChatGPT was.

420
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:52,118
So if you want me to make a video

421
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:53,754
giving the overview of all these AI tools,

422
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:55,708
then you can let me know in the comments below.

423
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,363
And for now, the link to download the course

424
00:17:58,363 --> 00:18:00,817
will be in the description below, with the coupon code.

425
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:01,863
If you liked this video,

426
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:04,539
you can watch my previous video on AI.

427
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:06,331
It talks about Q* AI.

428
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:10,505
In it, I explained what is Artificial General Intelligence.

429
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:12,017
Click here to watch it.

430
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:13,360
Thank you very much!
