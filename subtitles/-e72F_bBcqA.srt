00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,883
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,883 --> 00:00:02,678
On the morning of November 12, 2023,

3
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:05,533
while we were preparing for Diwali,

4
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:08,798
in a tunnel in Uttarkashi

5
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:11,264
41 workers were working

6
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,144
on building a highway project.

7
00:00:17,577 --> 00:00:19,645
Around 5:30 in the morning

8
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,486
this tunnel collapsed suddenly.

9
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:26,886
The workers were trapped in the tunnel.

10
00:00:26,886 --> 00:00:29,012
With no way out.

11
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:33,310
The collapsed wall of stones and mud 
standing between them and their way out,

12
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,186
was 60 meters long.

13
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:40,492
Soon, a concerned group of people 
gathered in this small city in Uttarakhand.

14
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:42,360
The next day, on November 13th,

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,331
the rescue mission began officially,

16
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:46,981
involving over 200 individuals.

17
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:50,453
It took 17 days of intensive efforts to 
successfully extricate the trapped workers.

18
00:00:50,453 --> 00:00:52,065
How did they achieve this feat?

19
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:55,982
Let's understand the entire rescue operation 
in today's video, with 3D animations.

20
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:58,729
Furthermore, let's answer the biggest question.

21
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:00,621
What is the underlying cause of the incident?

22
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:03,829
The root cause is the same that is faced by Joshimath,

23
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:08,526
a situation often overlooked 
by mainstream news channels.

24
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,648
Let's begin.

25
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:21,673
The incident unfolded in Uttarkashi district in Uttarakhand,

26
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:23,824
specifically in the Barkot-Silkyara tunnel,

27
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:26,295
this map shows its location.

28
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,888
This is a two-lane bi-directional tunnel

29
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:34,244
being constructed as a part of the Modi 
Government's ₹120 billion Char Dham project.

30
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:36,774
Let's talk about the details of the project later in the video,

31
00:01:36,774 --> 00:01:38,574
but broadly speaking,

32
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:41,934
this is a highway project connecting 4 North Indian Dhams.

33
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:45,431
Badrinath, Kedarnath, 
Yamunotri, and Gangotri.

34
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:48,149
Roads will be built connecting these four dhams,

35
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,921
to reduce the travelling distance between them.

36
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:54,437
PM Modi laid the foundation stone 
of this project in December 2016.

37
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:58,235
This particular tunnel was announced in February 2018.

38
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:02,126
under the Brahmakhal-Yamunotri National Highway section.

39
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:06,257
The purpose of this tunnel was to reduce 
the distance between Gangotri and Yamnotri

40
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:08,323
by approximately 20 km and 
45 minutes of travel time.

41
00:02:08,323 --> 00:02:12,933
The estimated cost of the project is ₹13.83 billion,

42
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:16,533
overseen by Navyug Engineering Company Limited

43
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:17,563
under the guidance of

44
00:02:17,563 --> 00:02:20,816
the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited.

45
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:25,634
From the Silkyara side, 2,340 meters 
of construction was nearly over.

46
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:28,885
And from Barkot, 1,600 meters was constructed. 

47
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:34,221
The collapsed tunnel section was situated 
270 meters from the Silkyara entrance,

48
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:37,957
the debris from the collapse formed a 60 meters thick wall.

49
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:42,296
Fortunately, since 2,000 meters of the tunnel was already constructed,

50
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,350
the trapped labourers

51
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,754
had a space of 2,000 meters to stretch their legs.

52
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:51,721
Fortunately, they weren't trapped in a small space.

53
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:55,567
The height of the enclosure they were trapped in was 8.5 meters.

54
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:57,728
Typically, incidents of this nature are

55
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:59,314
classified as "Act of God,"

56
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:01,328
signifying that it was a natural disaster.

57
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:05,839
However, the degree to which these events are 
influenced by natural and human factors

58
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,768
is a subject of ongoing discussion.

59
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:09,722
As per the government's press release,

60
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,333
the workers were engaged in reprofiling work,

61
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,230
a process involving adjustments to the tunnel structure.

62
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,038
This activity becomes necessary when

63
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:21,811
the surrounding rocks exhibit unexpected 
behaviours that went unnoticed previously.

64
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:25,925
The exact cause of the collapse will 
remains unknown until further research.

65
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:28,021
However, preliminary findings suggest

66
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:31,921
this collapse was due to a potential geological fault

67
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,933
known as the Shear Zone.

68
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:37,992
This refers to a thinner or weaker part of the Earth's crust,

69
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:41,550
The construction would have put 
a strain on the surrounding rocks,

70
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,038
leading to a landslide.

71
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:47,913
Another consideration as stated by 
ML Sharma, a professor from IIT Roorkee,

72
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:51,041
is the presence of undetected cavities in the rocks,

73
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,054
gaps between these mountain rocks.

74
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:57,641
These cavities naturally weaken such areas, 

75
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:59,700
increasing the risk of landslides.

76
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,367
These are 2 possible causes,

77
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,688
but we can only speculate right now

78
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,125
and the definitive reason will be established 
only after the completion of investigation reports.

79
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,905
There are two main approaches to constructing 
a tunnel construction in mountainous terrain,

80
00:04:09,905 --> 00:04:12,455
the first is the drill and blast method (DBM),

81
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:16,481
and the second is by using a tunnel boring machine (TBM).

82
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:20,550
The former involves drilling holes in stones,

83
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,353
placing explosives,

84
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:25,743
and literally blasting the rocks.

85
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:29,286
It's as if a small bomb is detonated from inside the rocks.

86
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:31,760
It is the simple and traditional approach.

87
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,770
Using the tunnel boring machine is a more expensive

88
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,607
but safer alternative.

89
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:40,605
The machine creates a hole in the rocks with a rotating head,

90
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:44,643
and precast concrete segments are then installed.

91
00:04:44,643 --> 00:04:48,548
Unfortunately, in the Himalayan mountains, 
we cannot use these machines.

92
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:51,551
Due to the extreme geological conditions.

93
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:52,964
As you have studied in school,

94
00:04:52,964 --> 00:04:56,049
the Himalayas are the youngest mountain ranges in the world.

95
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:58,499
At only 40-50 million years old,

96
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,320
they continue to grow,

97
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,560
resulting in highly sensitive 
and unpredictable conditions.

98
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,809
Consequently, accidents in these areas 
resulting from extensive construction

99
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,829
cannot be solely attributed to 'Act of God.'

100
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:17,380
Nevertheless, even in challenging situations, 
people often seek a divine explanation.

101
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,821
Consider this article,

102
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:22,868
where a local resident claims that there 
was a Baba Baukh Nath's temple on the site

103
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:26,135
which was removed to make way 
for the highway construction. 

104
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:27,865
He claims that this was the cause of the incident.

105
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:31,320
Attempts to find a divine cause behind 
natural or man-made disasters

106
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,014
are not unprecedented.

107
00:05:33,014 --> 00:05:35,654
In the case of the 2013 Kedarnath floods,

108
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:41,481
some locals attributed the calamity to 
the relocation of Dhari Devi's shrine

109
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:44,283
during the construction of 
the Alaknanda Hydroelectric Project.

110
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:49,726
During the rescue efforts in the tunnel, 
where over 200 people were involved,

111
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:54,926
a small temple was constructed at the 
entrance of the tunnel on November 18th,

112
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:56,141
and rituals were conducted.

113
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:57,933
Interestingly, this initiative wasn't 
undertaken by the locals

114
00:05:57,933 --> 00:05:59,869
but by NHIDCL,

115
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:04,025
the same company overseeing the tunnel construction.

116
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:06,570
However, neither the temple

117
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,762
nor the subsequent rescue operation 
would have been needed

118
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:12,521
had an emergency escape passage 
been incorporated as per the original plan.

119
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:15,165
When the Government sanctioned this project,

120
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:18,534
they had clearly stipulated the necessity of an escape passage,

121
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:21,564
a way out in case of emergency was mandatory. 

122
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:23,013
as per government guidelines,

123
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:24,467
such emergency exits

124
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:28,770
are recommended for every tunnel 
exceeding 1.5 km in length.

125
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,209
PC Nawani, the former director of the 
Geological Survey of India, emphasizes that

126
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:36,278
managing projects of this nature 
without escape routes is impractical.

127
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:38,914
The entire incident could have been 
averted had proper precautions been taken.

128
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:41,787
But anyhow, let's get back to the incident,

129
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:44,506
the truth was, the workers were trapped indeed.

130
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:45,803
How could they be rescued?

131
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:48,452
This marked the beginning of "Operation Zindagi"
[Operation Life]

132
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:52,732
Uttarakhand government formed a five-option rescue plan

133
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:56,585
to be carried out by five distinct agencies:

134
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:59,810
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC),

135
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,968
Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVNL),

136
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:05,437
Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL),

137
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:10,128
National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (NHIDCL),

138
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:13,069
and Tehri Hydro Development Corporation (THDCL).

139
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:15,527
Additionally, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO)

140
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:18,711
and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)

141
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:20,951
stood ready on the sidelines,

142
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:23,925
offering assistance whenever required.

143
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:26,245
The first step in the rescue operation focused on

144
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:29,041
ensuring a continuous oxygen supply to the trapped individuals

145
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,877
so that they could breathe properly.

146
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:35,769
A compressed air pipe was manoeuvred 
between the debris for this.

147
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:39,857
Simultaneously, a separate 4-inch pipe was passed through the debris

148
00:07:39,857 --> 00:07:43,347
to deliver snacks and dry fruits.

149
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:46,496
These measures were implemented 
on the first day, November 12th.

150
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:49,074
Notably, electricity was being supplied in the tunnel,

151
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:52,711
so the trapped individuals weren't in complete darkness.

152
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:54,730
There was some light.

153
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,040
The following day, a rescue plan was devised,

154
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,746
involving horizontal drilling to create a passage 

155
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,656
and passing a pipe through it,

156
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:06,577
that would be big enough for people 
to crawl through and escape.

157
00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:09,110
They had planned for horizontal drilling. 

158
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,547
Using an auger machine.

159
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:13,228
This is how the machine looks.

160
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:15,269
Since the first pipe had been passed on the first day,

161
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:17,777
it was possible to communicate with the trapped workers

162
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:21,965
allowing constant interaction and 
encouragement from the people outside.

163
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:31,589
THDC operated from the other side of the tunnel,

164
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:34,381
using micro-tunneling techniques.

165
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:39,828
Additionally, SJVN and ONGC were 
gearing up for vertical drilling if necessary.

166
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:44,679
Vertical drilling meant drilling a passage 
from the top of the mountain to the tunnel.

167
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:49,131
However, geologists expressed reservations about vertical drilling

168
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:53,138
due to potential complications with weak stones,

169
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:57,068
which could lead to further issues or even a landslide.

170
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:59,075
If it wasn't executed perfectly.

171
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:01,405
On 14th November, horizontal drilling commenced,

172
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:05,638
but the slow progress of the machine being used

173
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:09,272
and the additional debris caused by the drilling

174
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:12,310
led to the wall of debris becoming longer.

175
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,244
by now if you liked the animations 
in the video and the general editing, 

176
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:21,489
I would recommend that you consider 
a career option in video editing. 

177
00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:25,600
With the surge in YouTube channels, emerging YouTubers,

178
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,399
podcasts by CEOs,

179
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,864
and businesses creating videos,

180
00:09:30,864 --> 00:09:35,864
video editing presents itself as a legitimate 
and viable long-term career option,

181
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:40,323
where degrees or qualifications are not crucial.

182
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:41,808
Only your skills matters.

183
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:44,675

And it might open up 
a new career option for you.

205
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:42,969
Returning to our main topic,

206
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:44,066
on November 15th,

207
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:46,651
a decision was made to bring in 
a new, powerful machine.

208
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:51,059
This machine, transported from Delhi 
 via millitary aircraft in 3 parts

209
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:52,469
had to be assembled.

210
00:10:52,469 --> 00:10:54,338
It took a day.

211
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:56,010
So by November 16th,

212
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,426
the machine was ready for digging,

213
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:03,423
with the capability to excavate
5 meters of debris per hour. 

214
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:05,239
While the initial day went smoothly,

215
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:07,228
operations had to be halted the following day

216
00:11:07,228 --> 00:11:10,252
due to a concerning cracking sound from the tunnel.

217
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,615
The fear arose – could continued drilling 
lead to further sinking of the tunnel?

218
00:11:16,615 --> 00:11:19,590
A day was dedicated to thorough inspection,

219
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,946
by then five days had passed,

220
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:24,391
with no visible progress.

221
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:28,801
The frustration among the workers' relatives 
and rescue officials escalated,

222
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:30,375
resulting in a heated confrontation.

223
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:34,363
One distressed person cried out about 
his brother who was trapped for seven days.

224
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:35,927
People were so angry and agitated that

225
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:37,754
to pacify the growing anger,

226
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:40,363
Uttarkashi District Officer D.P. Baluni proposed

227
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:43,221
the idea of vertical drilling.

228
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:44,638
"People are agitated,

229
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:47,222
so it was decided to

230
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:49,738
provide vertical openings 
in addition to horizontal openings 

231
00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:50,966
for the rescue operation."

232
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:53,156
The plan with respect to vertical drilling involved

233
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:57,217
digging a passage for 90 to 105 meters.

234
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,873
Here, the BRO played a crucial role 
in constructing temporary roads

235
00:12:00,873 --> 00:12:03,761
so that the drilling machines 
could be transported to the top.

236
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:05,710
This was being done simultaneously,

237
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,760
preparations for vertical drilling began

238
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,438
along with the ongoing horizontal drilling from below.

239
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,255
A significant development occurred on 20th November

240
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:16,221
when Arnold Dix, a tunneling expert

241
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:20,642
and the president of the International Tunneling 
and Underground Space Association,

242
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:22,182
joined the rescue operation.

243
00:12:22,182 --> 00:12:24,441
Leveraging his expertise, 
Dix provided valuable suggestions

244
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:26,209
about what should be done next.

245
00:12:26,743 --> 00:12:27,741
On the same evening,

246
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:32,605
rescuers successfully inserted a pipe of 
6-inch diameter through the wall of debris.

247
00:12:32,605 --> 00:12:35,163
This development expanded possibilities,

248
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:37,194
since this pipe was wider,

249
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:41,167
proper food could be delivered 
to the trapped individuals.

250
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:44,054
The workers received their first hot meal since they were trapped,

251
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,900
a serving of hot khichdi.

252
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:52,148
An endoscopic camera was passed 
through the pipe to film the workers,

253
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:55,494
This was the first video where we could see them.

254
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:12,578
Beyond food, the pipe became a conduit for medicines, 
mobile phones, chargers, and walkie-talkies,

255
00:13:12,578 --> 00:13:16,202
The walkie-talkies enabled direct 
communication with the workers.

256
00:13:16,202 --> 00:13:19,693
On the same day, it was decided to dig two additional tunnels

257
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:21,794
to create additional escape routes.

258
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:23,763
By 21st November,

259
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:28,546
four 900 mm pipes had been 
successfully inserted through the debris.

260
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:31,641
However, the rescue operation was 
still far from being successful,

261
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:35,603
with the pipes interfering with the drilling.

262
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:39,299
This interference led to a slight delay on November 22.

263
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:41,318
Further setbacks occurred on November 23

264
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:43,625
when the platform upon which 
the drilling machine was placed,

265
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,988
had weakened,

266
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:47,688
that night was spent repairing that structure.

267
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:51,751
By November 24, the drilling machine had to be reassembled,

268
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:54,121
and the sequence of challenges persisted.

269
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:57,450
Once something was set right 
something other broke down.

270
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,731
On November 25, a significant setback unfolded

271
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:03,656
as the auger machine completely broke down

272
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:05,749
and was lodged in the tunnel.

273
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:07,752
Arnold Dix informed reporters that

274
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:10,885
the drilling machine had already broken 
down thrice during the rescue operations

275
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:13,188
and was now completely destroyed.

276
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:14,504
"The Auger is broken.

277
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:16,023
-Broken?
-Yeah, broken.

278
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:19,161
Yeah, the machine is busted.

279
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:20,347
It's irreparable.

280
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:21,333
It is destructed.

281
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,969
No more work from Auger."

282
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:25,045
On November 26, authorities announced

283
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:27,703
their intention to attempt vertical drilling again.

284
00:14:27,703 --> 00:14:32,102
By then, 20 meters had been drilled vertically,

285
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:34,899
but the primary focus remained on horizontal drilling,

286
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:37,728
with only 12 meters of drilling left.

287
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:40,542
Recognizing the machine's irreparable state, 
on November 27, a decision was made

288
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:43,502
to resort to manual drilling,

289
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:46,000
by bringing in rat hole miners.

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,088
Rat hole mining, an old and 
hazardous coal extraction method,

291
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:52,121
was used in the past.

292
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:54,669
It involved creating vertical passages by hand.

293
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:59,501
The passage would be barely big 
enough for a person to pass through it.

294
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:03,001
Despite being banned in India by the National Green Tribunal,

295
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:05,911
due to its adverse environmental impact

296
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:08,174
and the unsafe conditions for the miners,

297
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,991
in this situation, it was deemed the 
best option for this rescue operation.

298
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:15,134
A team of 12 rat hole mining experts worked diligently,

299
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:17,967
and by the evening of November 28,

300
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:21,350
it was reported that only 2 meters of digging remained.

301
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,608
Everyone waited for the good news with bated breaths,

302
00:15:23,608 --> 00:15:25,546
and finally, around 8 in the evening

303
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:28,585
the first worker was successfully 
brought out on a stretcher.

304
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:35,452
Subsequently, one by one, all 41 workers 
were rescued from this tunnel.

305
00:15:35,452 --> 00:15:38,903
"After 17 days of being trapped in 
the collapsed tunnel in Northern India,

306
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:41,775
rescuers have now freed all 41 workers."

307
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,644
Munna Qureshi was one of these 12 rat-hole mining expert,

308
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:47,464
he said that it was an emotional moment.

309
00:15:47,464 --> 00:15:50,342
He was the one who removed the last piece of debris.

310
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:53,219
He could see them once he removed the last piece.

311
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,822
He said that those workers hugged them

312
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,333
and thanked them once they were safely outside.

313
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,386
They worked incessantly for 24 hours to rescue the workers.

314
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:03,701
Qureshi said that his happiness knew no bounds,

315
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,493
and that he did it for his country.

316
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:08,360
Ambulances and helicopters stood ready outside,

317
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,692
the rescued workers were adorned with garlands,

318
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:14,630
and a freshly cooked meal awaited them.

319
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,410
Potatoes and cauliflower stew, roti, lentil soup, and rice

320
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,676
were served to them as they emerged.

321
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:24,191
The entire nation celebrated the safe rescue of these 41 workers,

322
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,162
and praises poured in for the rescuers.

323
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:30,641
However, amidst the celebration for 
this happy ending, it is crucial not to forget

324
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:33,027
the underlying cause of the incident

325
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:36,462
and the need to address its root cause.

326
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,538
Waiting for an official investigation may not be necessary,

327
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:43,468
as the actual reasons behind the incident are already known.

328
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:45,098
The answer to the question lies within

329
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:47,403
the Char Dham Highway project,

330
00:16:47,403 --> 00:16:50,687
The same reason that is contributing 
to the sinking of Joshimath.

331
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:55,412
This so-called development in Uttarakhand,

332
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:58,769
exemplified by projects like Char Dham,
adversely impacting the environment, 

333
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:02,852
escalating the risk of landslides and related accidents.

334
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:04,781
I am not making this up,
look at this article

335
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:08,481
"Tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand is a part 
of a bigger problem in the Himalayas" 

336
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:11,692
In the construction of roads, there was inadequate slope analysis.

337
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:15,152
There is extreme slope cutting at some places,

338
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:19,320
slopes have been cut up to 45 degrees to construct the roads.

339
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,170
This can cause landslides easily.

340
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:27,410
In fact, the region has witnessed an average 
of one landslide per day over the past 2 years.

341
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,762
According to this article.

342
00:17:28,762 --> 00:17:33,955
Environmental activists have 
raised concerns about this project.

343
00:17:33,955 --> 00:17:35,732
In February 2018,

344
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:38,542
Citizens for Green Doon, an NGO based in Dehradun,

345
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:41,017
lodged a complaint with the National Green Tribunal (NGT),

346
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:45,535
highlighting the catastrophic impact of 
this project on the Himalayan ecology.

347
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:50,122
They pointed out that, at that time, 25,000 trees 
had already been felled for the project,

348
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:52,288
violating the Forest Conservation Act.

349
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:53,889
Furthermore, the NGO emphasized that,

350
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:55,523
according to Indian environmental laws,

351
00:17:55,523 --> 00:17:58,632
every highway project exceeding 100 km

352
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:02,315
requires an environmental impact assessment.

353
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,897
However, the government 
unabashedly circumvented this regulation

354
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:10,074
they said that this wasn't a mega project 
of thousands of kilometers of highways,

355
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:13,057
they claimed to undertake 53 smaller projects,

356
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:15,648
each highway with a length of 
less than 100 kilometers.

357
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:19,553
This mega project was presented as a cluster of small projects

358
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:21,221
simply to bypass this law.

359
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:23,983
Consequently, in September 2018, the NGT ruled that

360
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:26,600
the project did not need an environmental clearance.

361
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,209
This order was later contested in the 
Supreme Court of India in August 2019,

362
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:35,368
leading to the appointment of a 
26-member High-Powered Committee,

363
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:38,847
led by environmentalist Ravi Chopra.

364
00:18:38,847 --> 00:18:43,314
The committee had to investigate the potential 
environmental and social ramifications

365
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:45,275
of this project in Uttarakhand

366
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:47,013
and provide recommendations based on their findings.

367
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:51,045
In July 2020, the 4 members of this committee, including Ravi Chopra,

368
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:54,083
took note of the government's guidelines from March 2018,

369
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,744
issued by the Ministry of Road and Transport Highways.

370
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:59,461
These guidelines specified that highways constructed on mountains

371
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:02,641
should not exceed a total width of 7 meters.

372
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,355
However, the government aimed for 
12-meters-wide highways on these mountains.

373
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:10,373
The other 21 committee members 
supported the government's plan.

374
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:14,873
In response, Ravi Chopra directly wrote to 
the Environment Ministry in August 2020, 

375
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:18,412
expressing concern beyond tree felling.

376
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:22,200
He emphasized that, in addition to cutting down trees and mountains,

377
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,920
the waste generated during road construction

378
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,520
was being indiscriminately dumped into rivers,

379
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,044
particularly in eco-sensitive zones

380
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,839
such as Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary,

381
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,423
Valley of Flowers National Park,

382
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:34,722
and Rajaji National Park.

383
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:37,004
Waste was being dumped at such places.

384
00:19:37,004 --> 00:19:38,630
The following month, in September 2020,

385
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,507
the Supreme Court considered 
Ravi Chopra's recommendation

386
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:46,799
and ruled that the highway's width 
should not exceed 7 meters.

387
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,072
This made sense as

388
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:50,082
wider roads would necessitate

389
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:53,833
more slope cutting, tree removal,

390
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,923
and more waste being dumped,

391
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:59,054
which could destabilise the Himalayan terrain

392
00:19:59,054 --> 00:20:02,631
and increase the chances of 
landslides and flash floods.

393
00:20:02,631 --> 00:20:05,613
"We observed unanimously 

394
00:20:05,613 --> 00:20:08,873
that the road width was the key factor 

395
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:11,817
which determines the extent of hill-cutting 

396
00:20:11,817 --> 00:20:14,342
and the subsequent environmental damage."

397
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:17,577
However, instead of adhering to the Supreme Court's decision, the government

398
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:20,560
employed a new masterstroke

399
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,000
to circumvent the Supreme Court's direction.

400
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,320
In November 2020, the Ministry of Defence entered the scene,

401
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,635
appealing to the Supreme Court for

402
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:31,094
the construction of a double-lane road,

403
00:20:31,094 --> 00:20:33,120
citing it as a necessity for the Army.

404
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,603
The Char Dham project was reframed,

405
00:20:35,603 --> 00:20:38,413
asserting that it was essential for 
the country's benefit and the Army.

406
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:40,577
That's why the roads had to be so wide.

407
00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:42,205
While the public had been initially informed

408
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:47,290
that the road construction was for the 
Char Dham Yatra and religious pilgrimage,

409
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,370
the project's purpose was suddenly recast

410
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,927
as a strategic imperative.

411
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:53,787
Rooted in national interest,

412
00:20:53,787 --> 00:20:58,229
specifically facilitating the movement 
of Indian troops to the Chinese border.

413
00:20:58,229 --> 00:20:59,904
The new reason was that since China

414
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:01,832
was constructing roads on its side of the border,

415
00:21:01,832 --> 00:21:03,432
India needed to do the same.

416
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:05,795
However, a major difference is the terrain.

417
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:08,847
China's territory lies on the Tibetan Plateau,

418
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:11,862
characterized by fewer mountains,

419
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:13,620
a relatively stable landscape,

420
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,757
building roads is easier there

421
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:17,919
with fewer adverse ecological impacts.

422
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,370
Following this appeal by the Ministry of Defence,

423
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,956
the Ministry of Highways modified its 
2018 directives the subsequent month,

424
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:26,120
stating that the 7-meter guideline

425
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,945
could be expanded to 10 meters

426
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:31,340
if a project holds strategic importance.

427
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,338
A year later, on December 14, 2021,

428
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:37,587
the Supreme Court reluctantly approved

429
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:41,634
the continuation of the Char Dham project as it is.

430
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:46,931
Consequently, the highways in the 
Char Dham project are 12 meters wide.

431
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,761
Looking at how unabashedly the government

432
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:52,905
has disregarded rules and guidelines for this project,

433
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:56,265
Ravi Chopra resigned from the committee.

434
00:21:56,265 --> 00:22:02,010
As of today, the Char Dham project has 
resulted in the clearance of 600 hectares of forest,

435
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,826
the felling of over 56,000 trees,

436
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:08,938
and the widening of 75% of the Char Dham highway.

437
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:14,972
The Ministry of Highways acknowledged 
200 landslides in the area in 2021,

438
00:22:14,972 --> 00:22:18,984
And in November 2021, they admitted to the Supreme Court that

439
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:24,000
125 landslides were triggered around 
the route of the Char Dham project

440
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,997
attributed to the construction work.

441
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:28,191
Do you recall what I said in the video on Bhopal Gas Tragedy?

442
00:22:28,191 --> 00:22:32,071
Before the incident, journalists, activists, and experts, 

443
00:22:32,071 --> 00:22:33,792
gave repeated warnings that

444
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,667
disaster may strike at any moment.

445
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:40,107
Similarly, experts and activists are giving warning repeatedly now.

446
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:41,671
Look at these headlines;

447
00:22:41,671 --> 00:22:43,168

00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:28,214
This was acknowledged by the Supreme Court 5 years ago.

464
00:23:28,214 --> 00:23:30,433
Look at this article from 2018.

465
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:34,580
"Frequent landslides in Uttarakhand on 
Char Dham yatra marg raises questions"

466
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,707
In light of this data and warnings,

467
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,586
there are no indications of the plan being modified. 

468
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:44,400
The government is celebrating the rescue of the tunnel workers.

469
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,290
There are indications that tunnel work will resume.

470
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,310
What's unfortunate is that,

471
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,167
in the coming years, we might get more news

472
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:54,795
of more such incidents in Uttarakhand.
