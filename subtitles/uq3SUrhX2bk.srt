1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,860
I was watching a Stand up Comedy video on
youtube recently

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:09,180
And then I saw a comment on the video
By a handle named @feminist_boy_manoj

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,100
And 
the comment read

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,180
“What is this habit of Stand Up Comedians
using abusive words to get laughter?

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,960
Act responsible guys. Remember,

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,160
women are also watching these
videos”

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:30,060
And I also saw a reply to the comment
By a handle named @lalitha_19111954

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,960
And the reply read “Chup Kar Madarchod”

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,860
Best thing I have seen on the internet so far

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,660
Also I perform in English, I don’t perform
in Hindi

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,960
Because I am not a Star Plus kind of a guy

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,140
I am more of a Sun TV kind of a guy

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,400
That's what I am
(One guy continues laughing thinking about Suryavamsam movie)

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,540
Do you watch it a lot sir?

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,580
I come from this small town in Tamil Nadu
Called ‘Chenna’i, if you guys know about it

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,280
That’s the problem, whenever I come out of Chennai

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,920
A lot of people think I am a moron

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,860
So I always tell them, “No. I am an oxymoron”

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Because I am a Tamilian who can speak Hindi

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,200
But when I say I know Hindi, I know Hindi
better than most Tamilians do

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,640
So I am the kind of guy who goes into a Punjabi
Dhaba

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,720
And says “Agali order, Chaar roti chahiye”
Mostly in Amitabh Bhachan’s tone

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,000
Because Kaun Banega Crorepati is the only
Hindi show I ever watched in my life

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,800
When I need six rotis, I can be
“Bhaiya, che roti chahiye”

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,860
My problem really is when I need twelve rotis
Because that is when I have to say

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,860
“Bhaiyaaa… Ek dho roti chahiye”

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,680
(Audience laughing longer than he expected)
Okay relax

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,440
(Audience laughing more)
See, you cannot blame me because

29
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,680
That is how the railway station ladies taught
me Hindi

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,400
For some reason it is always
“Agali gaadi number Dho-Shoonya-Ek-Chaar aa gaya hai”

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,220
That too with an orgasm every time she says it.

32
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,980
(Doing poor orgasmic impression of the same numbers)

33
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,840
Why can’t they just fucking call it “Dho
hazaar….”

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,900
Whatever.

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,140
You Hindi speaking people in the house
Have you ever used the word ‘Shoonya’

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,790
in any of your day to day conversations?
No right? It is not just with Hindi

37
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,440
Even when a Tamilian says his phone number
in Tamil

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,720
It is always like ‘Onbadhu-Ezhu-Ettu-ZERO-naalu-moonu-ZERO’

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,980
Just because we Indian invented zero

40
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,420
it 
 become an official word in every damn Indian
language

41
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,260
The funniest thing is, for a very long time
I thought the phrase ‘Ugly gaadi’ meant

42
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,260
the train is going to be very dirty

43
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,920
Which is apparently always true right?

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,820
I thought it was a disclaimer from the Railways
department

45
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,880
Saying “Our trains are f**king ugly, please
don’t enter it”

46
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,180
Hindi is one language which always embarrasses
me man.

47
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,690
I used to work for this company called Amazon
And before you guys get any judgemental

48
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,180
I used to work as a Software Engineer there.
I have to tell this because the last time

49
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,060
I told a lady I work for Amazon
She was like “Ooooohhhhhhhhhhhh!”

50
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,840
“Which area do you take care of?”

51
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Happens when you look like a real estate agent.

52
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,770
I used to go to office in my office cab regularly
And one fine day a pretty North Indian lady

53
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,069
was sitting next to me
And like an ass, I wanted to impress her with

54
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:36,140
my Hindi
So I spoke to the cab waala saying

55
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,760
“Bhaiya seedha chalthe, signal ke aage,
left se rukho”

56
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,380
And for some reason she smiled at me and said
“No language would help you bro, just shut up!”

57
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,020
It is not like I don’t try to learn the

58
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,349
language of Hindi
That is why most of the times I go to my Hindi

59
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:53,780
speaking colleagues
And try to create small talks with them

60
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,250
Like asking them “Kya bhai, Kaisa hey aap”
But as a Tamilian I expect them to understand me

61
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,580
and come up with simple replies
Like “Acha hai”

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,380
“Bahuth acha hai”

63
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,380
Or if they are not so happy, they can say

64
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,580
“Acha nahi hai”
But that is when this guy wants to mess up

65
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,440
with me
Comes up with big ass dialogues like

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,520
“Ek gaav mein ek kisaan rakuthatha ki, Kabhi
Kushi kabhi gam khi, Saala kaadoos ki,

67
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,680
Ache din aane waale hai”

68
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,880
And then I have to go “Acha hai”

69
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,740
And then I just walk away
(But most times, deep inside I am like ‘Ommaley’)

70
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,180
Not even staying there.

71
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,780
With this level of Hindi I had the audacity
to Gurgaon.

72
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,890
I was hungry, I went to this food centre called
Haldirams

73
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,170
It was a self service counter, so I got my
food coupon

74
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:42,280
And then I gave my token to the food counter
And I was waiting for my turn to be called

75
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,340
And then I realised that these guys were shouting out token numbers in Hindi

76
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,380
And my token number was ‘Eight hundred and Eighty eight’

77
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,800
Immediately I was like “I am going to starve tonight. Let me be ready”

78
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,820
But I didn’t want to give up. So I took

79
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,360
out my google translator
And typed ‘888’ in numbers, and then I

80
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,750
said “Translate to Hindi”
And google said ‘888’(in numbers).

81
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,000
I was like “Google is stupid man”
So I tried to be specific

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,570
I typed “Eight hundred and eighty eight”
in English

83
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,660
And translated it and google said ‘Aat sau
assi aat’

84
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,700
For the next five minutes, my goal was to
remember it

85
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:23,400
So I started reciting “Aat sau assi aat,Aat
sau assi aat, Aat sau assi aat”

86
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,010
The guys was like “Aat sau pachpan”
I was like “NO. Aat sau assi aat,Aat sau

87
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,640
assi aat, Aat sau…”
The guy was like “Aat sau Athiban”

88
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,500
I was like “NO. Aat sau assi aat,Aat sau
assi aat, Aat sau…”

89
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,460
Athiban is not a number, it is just my friend’s
name

90
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,980
Five minutes later my turn came out and the
guy shouted

91
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,760
“Token number Aat-aat-aat”

92
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,860
These railway station ladies man, I hate them!

93
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,060
I like talking about languages
Because language is one thing that unites us

94
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,280
at the same time divides us.

95
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,140
I know this because I am a Tamilian who lives in Bangalore

96
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,040
And my roommate in Bangalore is a Kannadiga,

97
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,640
from Karnataka
Sometimes he tells me

98
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,250
“Navin, you are in Karnataka, you should
learn Kannada”

99
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,260
Which I completely empathise with
That is why I always tell him

100
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,040
“Dude, I will definitely learn Kannada,
once I am done with Java and Python”

101
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,020
Because if I am not going to learn Java and
Python

102
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,540
I am not going to be in the Silicon Valley
of India to learn Kannada in the first place right?

103
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,120
But this is why I like South Indian metropolitan cities in general

104
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,260
Because people from different parts of the country come and live here

105
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,740
Be it Bombay or Bangalore

106
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,380
Sometimes even people from outside the country
live here

107
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,250
I think that is why there are very less road
rages in these cities

108
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,080
Because most of the time if you have to fight
with another person on the streets

109
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,490
The common language is English
And we Indians are good at a lot of things

110
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,139
Fighting in English is not one among them
That is why the maximum quarrel you can see

111
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:50,860
in English is
One guy saying “Fuck you”

112
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,260
And another guy saying
“You fuck you”

113
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,660
And then both of them fuck off
That is the end of the quarrel, nobody gets hurt

114
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,220
I have been in fights, I have never been like

115
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:04,590
“Hey, I am going to kill you, carve your
chest up with a knife, use your skin as furniture

116
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,740
covers, make a necklace out of both of your
ears and screw your skull through one your eyeballs”

117
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,920
Thanks for laughing at that man

118
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,220
It took me three weeks to by heart that one
dialogue

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,400
Had to download the script of Django Unchained

120
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,620
Sometimes even NRIs who come back from

121
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,260
UK and western countries
Even they can’t fight in English

122
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,040
Firstly I don’t know why they have this
American dream, a lot of people go to the

123
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,310
US
Because I recently went to the US to realise

124
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,310
that there is not much difference between
India and these western countries

125
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,540
Except this one thing called the usage of
toilet paper

126
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,960
And when I went there I had no difficulty
on how to use a toilet paper.

127
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,900
Thanks to all the YouTube videos I watched

128
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,940
That’s how you learn things in the internet era, I am sorry

129
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,270
But once I was done with all the basic etiquettes

130
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,639
My real confusion was whether to throw the
used paper

131
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:58,170
Into the dustbin or into the toilet commode
Because think about it, traditionally in India

132
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:03,169
all the waste paper goes to the dustbin
And all the shit goes to the toilet commode

133
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:06,340
And this thing in my hand is a very weird
combination

134
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,430
That is why most of the times I was there
I just dropped it on the floor and just ran

135
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,380
away
I was just clever I didn’t use the same

136
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,420
loo twice on the same day

137
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,600
I also met a friend there, a school friend of mine

138
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,620
who has been living there for three
years

139
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,410
And he consistently had this fake accent,
like how people have it

140
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,810
At one point I got really annoyed
So I slapped him and said, “Dude, Talk properly”

141
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,849
And he shouted, “OMG! Did you just slap
me?”

142
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,459
And that is when I realised he was desperately
trying to be an American

143
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:39,909
Because only Americans can do that shit
Getting slapped by a person and asking the

144
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,419
same person
“Did you just slap me?”

145
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,760
Any Indians response to a slap is a slap back
or a swear word

146
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,200
But this guys response was a rhetorical question

147
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,020
I became angry, I slapped him again

148
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,620
And this time he started sounding like an
African dude

149
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,140
“Yo man, please don’t hit me like that!”(In
poor African accent)

150
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,081
So I slapped him again
And then he started sounding like a Sheikh

151
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:05,780
from Saudi Arabia
And that is when I realised that with every slap

152
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,800
This guy is actually coming back to his home country

153
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,020
One slap at a time

154
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,180
The last time I slapped him so hard
He became so Indian that he started chasing

155
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,820
me shouting “Lavadekebal”
And then I had to run for my life

156
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,400
But I was talking about road rages
Because I recently got into a road rage in

157
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,940
Bangalore
I was on my bike and I dashed into this car

158
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,381
And I immediately realised it was my mistake
So I was ready to apologise to this guy

159
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:32,820
So I came out my bike
And this guy came out of his car

160
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,830
The problem is even before starting to listen
to me

161
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,950
He started shouting at me in Hindi
And I was like “If you are going to shout

162
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,510
at me in your mother tongue
I am going to shout at you in my mother tongue”

163
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:47,040
And I started shouting at him in Tamil
Which went on for the next two minutes

164
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,190
After which both of us realised
This is not helping either of us

165
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,320
Why are we even doing this?
He also probably realised it

166
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,960
So he was like, “Dude, can we fight in English?
Because I don’t know Kannada”

167
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,980
I understand
The South Indian in me got furious

168
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,861
I wanted to tell him “Dude this is not Kannada,
this is Tamil

169
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:13,660
These are very different South Indian languages”
But the Bangalorean in me told him something

170
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,330
That I always wanted to tell people in Bangalore
So I looked at his straight into his eyes

171
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,320
I told him, “This is Karnataka, you should
learn Kannada”

172
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,020
He was like “Sure, Thank you man and got
into the car”

173
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:30,000
Alright guys, that’s been my time, you guys
have been a fantastic audience. Thanks for listening!
