1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,083
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,083 --> 00:00:05,285
Formula 1 racing is a sport which saw a boost in popularity recently.

3
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:08,435
It is one of the most dangerous sports in the world.

4
00:00:08,435 --> 00:00:10,462
While driving the F1 cars,

5
00:00:10,462 --> 00:00:15,083
The temperature is normally at 45°C for the driver.

6
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:18,084
And can go up to 60°C.

7
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:22,098
There’s so much heat and humidity that in a normal race,

8
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:26,016
The F1 driver loses about 2-3 kg in weight.

9
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:27,517
Simply by completing a race.

10
00:00:27,517 --> 00:00:29,251
Because they sweat so much.

11
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:30,386
“And also during the way,

12
00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:32,917
I lose up to 4 kilos in a race in an hour and 45 minutes.”

13
00:00:32,917 --> 00:00:34,951
“But this is because it gets so hot, isn’t it?

14
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,288
So if you’re in Singapore or Malaysia or something…”

15
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,483
“Yeah, those ones are killer.”

16
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:40,452
The cars are driven at such high speeds

17
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:43,797
That at every turn, the driver has to bear high G forces.

18
00:00:43,797 --> 00:00:45,324
Up to 6 Gs.

19
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:46,544
Come, in today’s video, let’s understand

20
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:48,876
How this game actually works.

21
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:51,981
What is its Billion-Dollar Business Model?

22
00:00:51,981 --> 00:00:54,980
And should it even be considered a sport?

23
00:00:55,582 --> 00:00:58,445
"Formula 1 is the most exciting sport on the planet!"

24
00:00:58,445 --> 00:00:59,830
"Grand Prix!"

25
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,223
"F1 is all about pushing the limits of speed

26
00:01:02,223 --> 00:01:03,555
science and nerves."

27
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:18,594
Friends, Formula 1 originated in France.

28
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:20,923
In 1906, a race was held.

29
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:23,025
It was called the French Grand Prix.

30
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:26,528
These words should sound like /ɡrænd prɪks/

31
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,947
But since it’s a French term,

32
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:29,278
It’s pronounced as /grahn pri:/

33
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:31,838
It literally means the Great Prize.

34
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:34,601
Since then, the name Grand Prix continued

35
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:37,146
And till now, during Formula 1 racing

36
00:01:37,146 --> 00:01:38,346
This name is used.

37
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:42,689
Back then, car races did not test the speed of the driver.

38
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,656
Rather, they focused on the endurance of the driver.

39
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:47,982
Literally, the race would stretch from one city to another on normal roads.

40
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:51,724
In fact, the first Grand Prix race lasted 24 hours

41
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:53,076
And was held in Le Mans.

42
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:55,612
If you have watched the film, Ford v Ferrari,

43
00:01:55,612 --> 00:01:56,943
It was based on this race.

44
00:01:56,943 --> 00:02:01,160
In 1904, an international association was established.

45
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,968
It is now known as FiA.

46
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:06,887
Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile.

47
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:10,072
This is the governing body of Formula 1, FiA.

48
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:11,622
Similar to FIFA for football

49
00:02:11,622 --> 00:02:12,981
And ICC for cricket.

50
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:15,218
It was only after 1946

51
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,799
That professional racing began to be conducted in an organised manner.

52
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:21,555
Some rules were drafted in 1947,

53
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:22,945
known as the Formulas.

54
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:24,782
The duration of the races,

55
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:27,671
The types of cars that could be used for the races,

56
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:29,618
That the racing cars should be a single seater.

57
00:02:29,618 --> 00:02:30,818
That it should be an open wheel.

58
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:35,256
Open wheel means that the wheels of the car extend outwards from its body.

59
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:38,445
Today, a typical Formula 1 race car looks like this.

60
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:40,074
But before we get to the car,

61
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:42,237
Let’s get to the Formula 1 Championship.

62
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:47,167
The first season of the World Championship was announced in 1950.

63
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,271
A championship with 7 races across 7 countries.

64
00:02:57,284 --> 00:02:59,977
This first Championship was won by an Italian driver,

65
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:02,099
driving for the Alfa Romeo team.

66
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,947
Friends, now in the 2023 Championship season

67
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:08,028
There will be 23 races.

68
00:03:08,028 --> 00:03:10,127
If the names of the team seem familiar,

69
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:14,458
It’s because most of the teams in Formula 1 racing

70
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,094
Are car manufacturers.

71
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:19,862
Friends, here comes the most unique aspect of Formula 1 racing.

72
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:22,778
Winning a Formula 1 Championship

73
00:03:22,778 --> 00:03:24,782
doesn’t depend solely on the skill of the driver,

74
00:03:24,782 --> 00:03:26,945
On how well the driver can drive,

75
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:31,257
But it also depends on how well the car was made.

76
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:34,253
This game is a competition of technology as well.

77
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:36,713
To see who can manufacture the fastest car.

78
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:39,525
This is why several car manufacturers,

79
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:41,859
Participate in Formula 1 Championship.

80
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:44,214
Other than the publicity of these companies,

81
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:45,778
Another benefit to them is that

82
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:49,622
When new technologies would be innovated during Formula 1,

83
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:54,097
Those technologies can be later used for manufacturing consumer cars.

84
00:03:54,097 --> 00:03:58,008
The cars commonly sold to average people can also be improved.

85
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:00,851
Friends, there are several examples of this

86
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:04,497
Technologies that are nowadays used in most common cars,

87
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:07,820
That were first discovered during F1.

88
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,315
For example, Carbon Fibre.

89
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:14,156
A material that is used in BMW, Aston Martin, and Porsche cars now,

90
00:04:14,156 --> 00:04:20,118
It was used for the first time in 1981 by McLaren in Formula 1.

91
00:04:20,118 --> 00:04:23,200
The first company to build a car chassis with this material.

92
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,574
This was an expensive but light material.

93
00:04:25,574 --> 00:04:27,274
It improved fuel efficiency.

94
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:29,592
Some other examples of such technology are

95
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:32,299
Using Hybrid Powertrains and Wheel Buttons.

96
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:34,644
The rules of the competition force the companies to

97
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:36,852
innovate even the tiniest aspect

98
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:39,245
So that the cars can be as fast as possible.

99
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:45,446
The current world record for the fastest speed is 372.5 km/hr.

100
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:49,974
This happened during a race in Mexico in 2016.

101
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:52,834
This speed record is held by Valtteri Bottas.

102
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,790
But other than in an actual race,

103
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,450
The full potential of an F1 car was seen in 2005,

104
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:04,109
When Honda’s team achieved 397.7 km/hr.

105
00:05:04,109 --> 00:05:06,950
This was for the purpose of the record test.

106
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,212
This test was conducted in a very special place.

107
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:11,082
 

108
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:13,970
A dry lake bed where for kilometres around

109
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,392
There’s only a plain field like this.

110
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:19,801
But normally, the speed of the F1 cars is so high that

111
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:23,353
It is faster than the takeoff speed of an airplane.

112
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:25,596
When a large airplane takes off,

113
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:28,334
Its speed is around 250 km/hr.

114
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:29,990
Friends, do you know what this means?

115
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,293
Had there been wings on these cars,

116
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:33,907
These cars would’ve flown.

117
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:37,227
Even without wings, they could easily take off

118
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:40,488
This is the reason for the peculiar shape at the back of the cars.

119
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:44,022
These are ‘wings’ to counter the wings that planes have.

120
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:47,092
In school, you would’ve studied that the shape of the wings of an airplane

121
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:48,372
Aims to create a lift.

122
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:50,416
High pressure and low pressure on either side

123
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,981
Allowing the plane to take off.

124
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:54,105
In the F1 cars, it's the opposite.

125
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:55,877
It creates a negative lift.

126
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:58,490
So that the cars can be pushed onto the track.

127
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,581
The downforce produced is equal to 5G.

128
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:04,224
A force of 5 times the weight of the car

129
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:06,357
Pushes it downwards.

130
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:08,741
This provides traction to the tires

131
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:11,128
enabling them to execute sharp turns.

132
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:13,107
At the beginning of the video, I told you,

133
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,075
That Formula 1 is an extremely dangerous sport.

134
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:18,125
It is believed to be one of the most dangerous sports in the world.

135
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,198
Why?

136
00:06:19,198 --> 00:06:22,082
When driving in day-to-day life has turned so dangerous

137
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:25,583
With the high chances of a person dying in a car accident,

138
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,123
This is such a high speed sport.

139
00:06:28,123 --> 00:06:30,138
Obviously, this would have an added danger.

140
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:46,416
In total, 52 drivers have died since Formula 1 racing began.

141
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,415
The most famous accident was of

142
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:51,977
The three-time champion Ayrton Senna's death in 1994.

143
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:56,328
In 1970, one driver died

144
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:59,914
And was posthumously awarded the championship.

145
00:06:59,914 --> 00:07:02,682
This happened for the Austrian driver Jochen Rindt.

146
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:07,191
Simply because drivers accumulate points over different races.

147
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:10,119
Even after Rindt’s death, no driver could

148
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:12,540
catch up to his accumulated points in that season,

149
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,731
So he was given the winner’s trophy, after his death.

150
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:16,452
But specifically speaking,

151
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:19,779
several steps are taken to ensure safety during Formula 1 races.

152
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:24,274
Obviously, the first is providing helmets by the companies compulsorily.

153
00:07:24,274 --> 00:07:26,837
These are stronger than normal helmets

154
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:29,793
They have carbon-fibre head and neck support.

155
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:33,542
So that the vertebrate of a driver can be protected in case of any crash.

156
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,699
Additionally, the suit that the drivers wear

157
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,034
Is made of multi-layered fireproof material.

158
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:40,350
In case the car catches fire in an accident,

159
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,901
At least their clothes won’t catch fire.

160
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:44,100
Drivers are equipped with biometric gloves

161
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,140
The gloves are fitted with sensors that

162
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,319
constantly measure and transmit vitals such as heartbeats to medical staff.

163
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,474
The seatbelts in the car are so tight that

164
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,642
The help of another person is required

165
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,682
To fasten the seatbelt.

166
00:07:57,682 --> 00:07:59,875
There are fire extinguishers in the cars too

167
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:04,919
but the most groundbreaking innovation in terms of safety was in 2018,

168
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,817
when this Halo was introduced.

169
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:09,190
Halo is basically a steel bar,

170
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,752
that is placed above the head in these cars.

171
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:13,914
It is made of Grade 5 Titanium.

172
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:18,395
Its purpose is to protect the driver's head in case the car is upturned.

173
00:08:18,395 --> 00:08:21,250
When this was introduced in 2018,

174
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,174
this angered several people,

175
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:26,431
they were infuriated because the cars wouldn't have an open cockpit anymore.

176
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:28,232
They claimed that it looked ugly

177
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:29,330
and was an unnecessary addition.

178
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,888
But since then, it has been 4-5 years,

179
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:35,022
this innovation has saved the lives of many drivers.

180
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:38,746
The Halo is the strongest part of an F1 car.

181
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:43,938
It is strong enough to sustain the weight of 2 African elephants on top of it.

182
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:47,337
So yeah, such safety innovations took place in recent times,

183
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:49,091
to make the sport safer.

184
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:52,693
These F1 cars are truly engineering marvels.

185
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:55,255
Years of knowledge accumulated

186
00:08:55,255 --> 00:08:57,428
to craft these to perfection.

187
00:08:57,428 --> 00:09:00,151
Friends, this is why, today, for a new company

188
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,064
it is so difficult to enter this business.

189
00:09:02,064 --> 00:09:03,582
Money isn't the only factor.

190
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:06,962
This requires years of knowledge and persistence.

191
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,835
As Aamir Khan said in 3 Idiots,

192
00:09:08,835 --> 00:09:11,298
"Study to be capable, not successful."

193
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:13,075
"Don't chase success

194
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:15,229
aim for excellence.

195
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:17,111
And success would follow."

196
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:20,137
Similarly, if you want to be successful too.

197
00:09:20,137 --> 00:09:22,110
You need to have the desire to learn.

198
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,491
It needs hard work.

199
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:25,537
Dreaming won't be enough.

200
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:28,481
Here, today's sponsor Scaler.com can help you

201

00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:57,183
Those who worked hard and completed their course

212
00:09:57,183 --> 00:10:02,134
have seen a salary hike of 126% on average.

213
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:05,072
They claim that 93.5% of the learners

214
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,427
have later been placed in top tech companies.

215

to judge for yourself.

219
00:10:16,764 --> 00:10:18,299
Before joining the course.

220
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,669
Go check it out.

221
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:20,833
And now let's get back to the topic.

222
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,832
Let's talk about the Business Model.

223
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:25,599
How does the financial aspect work?

224
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:28,972
2 types of companies are involved in Formula 1 racing.

225
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:31,356
The constructor companies that make cars.

226
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:33,596
And the engine manufacturer companies

227
00:10:33,596 --> 00:10:34,701
that make engines.

228
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:38,243
Presently, there are about 10 constructor companies, namely Alpha Romeo,

229
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:40,727
Alphatauri, Alpine, Astin Martin,

230
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,700
Ferrari, Haas, McLaren,

231
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,963
Mercedes, Red Bull, and Williams.

232
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:47,720
But only 4 companies manufacture engines.

233
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,146
Ferrari, Mercedes, Renault, and Honda.  

234
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:54,521
Ferrari's team is the most successful team in the history of Formula 1.

235
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:58,138
They have won 16 constructor titles
and 15 driver titles.

236
00:10:58,138 --> 00:11:00,109
A point to note here is that

237
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:02,481
in a Formula 1 Championship,

238
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:05,335
there's a winning driver and a winning constructor.

239
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:06,914
Each team has 2 drivers.

240
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:10,008
A team can be a constructor champion

241
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:12,838
by taking into account the performance of both drivers.

242
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,225
But a driver championship can be won

243
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:19,335
when a driver gets the most points at an individual level.

244
00:11:19,335 --> 00:11:23,177
Since the make of the car plays such an important role,

245
00:11:23,177 --> 00:11:27,314
some people argue that more than the skills of the driver,

246
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:30,142
the construction of the car is more important for winning a race.

247
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:31,558
So often it so happens that

248
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,481
the best drivers do not win as many championships.

249
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:36,488
For example, many F1 fans believe that

250
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:40,523
Fernando Alonso has been the best driver in the history of F1.

251
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:42,235
In terms of technique.

252
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,597
But he has won only 2 championships.

253
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:46,993
In 2005 and 2006 with Renault.

254
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:51,201
Since the construction of the car plays such an important role in this game,

255
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:54,461
it means that a large amount of money is involved here.

256
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:56,850
To some extent, the team with more money

257
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,129
could use better technology and strategies for their cars.

258
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:01,886
But it's interesting to see that

259
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:05,461
it is a risky business for companies to participate in Formula 1.

260
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:07,235
Let's look at the financials of Red Bull.

261
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:11,001
This team has recently won a Constructor Championship,

262
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:14,048
and the winning drivers were from this team as well.

263
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:17,077
In 2018, their sister team Toro Rosso,

264
00:12:17,077 --> 00:12:20,269
spend $181.1 million in total.

265
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:22,855
It's around ₹15 billion.

266
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:27,026
And their revenue was at $183.6 million.

267
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:29,585
Their spending and earnings

268
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:30,959
had a minute difference.

269
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,622
Their profit was only $1.8 million.

270
00:12:34,622 --> 00:12:37,156
Only ₹150 million after taxes.

271
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,851
It's very little profit considering the money being spent here.

272
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:43,215
And this was a top-level team.

273
00:12:43,215 --> 00:12:46,365
The companies believe that the return on investment they'd get

274
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,806
from other sources would be much better.

275
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:52,874
Such as publicity and the progress in technology.

276
00:12:52,874 --> 00:12:56,972
In 2022, FiA placed a cap on the budget.

277
00:12:56,972 --> 00:12:58,942
$140 million.

278
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:01,686
No team can spend more than this.

279
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:03,442
So that there's some equality in the competition.

280
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:07,065
This year, in 2023, this cap has been lowered to

281
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:09,038
$135 million.

282
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,097
The salary of the drivers are paid by the teams

283
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:14,147
but that is kept outside the budget cap restrictions.

284
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:16,889
So there's no limit to the salary paid to the drivers.

285
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:19,917
It means that similar to other sports,

286
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:22,855
there's a large inequality in the salaries paid to the drivers.

287
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:25,481
Some premium drivers, top-level drivers,

288
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:28,153
are paid much higher salaries than others.

289
00:13:28,153 --> 00:13:30,116
Such as Max Verstappen.

290
00:13:30,116 --> 00:13:33,058
He has been the Driver Champion for the last 2 years,

291
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:35,013
It's estimated that last year,

292
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:37,650
he was paid around $60 million in the year.

293
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,127
Compare it to Mick Schumacher's salary,

294
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:42,675
who was paid only $1 million for the same year.

295
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:44,847
Obviously, the salary depends on several things.

296
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:46,513
Other than the driver's success,

297
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:50,016
it is also dependent on the team for which the driver is driving,

298
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:52,515
the level it is at and how much money it has.

299
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:55,181
Mick Schumacher races for the Haas team,

300
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:57,327
that is still growing.

301
00:13:57,327 --> 00:14:01,066
Presently, though there are no Indian teams in Formula 1 racing,

302
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:04,192
but there is an Indian connection to the F1.

303
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:06,817
Till now, we had 2 Indian drivers.

304
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:08,091
Narain Karthikeyan,

305
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:09,184
And Karun Chandhok.

306
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:13,925
They drove and participated in the Championship for 3 years and 2 years respectively.

307
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:16,500
But perhaps a better highlight for India was that

308
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,812
India had a team in Formula 1.

309
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:21,803
Force India.

310
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:24,544
The team was created in 1991,

311
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:27,018
when it was known as Spyker F1.

312
00:14:27,018 --> 00:14:28,325
Under different ownership

313
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:34,561
but in 2007, Vijaya Mallya and Michiel Mol, director of the team, bought it.

314
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:37,704
And its name was changed to Force India.

315
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:39,765
It debuted in 2008.

316
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:42,038
The same year, the expenses of this team

317
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:44,162
rose by 74.4%.

318
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:45,766
The biggest increase till date.

319
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:48,998
Back then, the primary sponsors of the team were Kingfisher,

320
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:51,072
RIL and ICICI bank.

321
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:56,352
In 2011, Sahara India Pariwar bought 42.5% shares of this team. 

322
00:14:56,352 --> 00:15:02,175
Mallya was left with 42.5% 
and Michiel Mol with 15% shares.

323
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:04,552
And so the team was renamed again

324
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:06,228
to Sahara Force India.

325
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:10,751
Friends, in its short career, this team wasn't very successful

326
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:14,335
but with time, it was definitely improving.

327
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:16,464
The drivers were showing promise.

328
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:20,264
In fact, even this year, 3 drivers from that team would be racing.

329
00:15:20,264 --> 00:15:22,682
Nice Hulkenberg for Haas.

330
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:24,716
Sergio Perez for Red Bull.

331
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,765
And Esteban Ocon for Alpine.

332
00:15:26,765 --> 00:15:30,685
Till 2017, the Force India team improved year after year.

333
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:33,111
Each season their performance was better than the last.

334
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:35,404
2017 was the best year

335
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:37,204
when Perez and Ocon were their drivers.

336
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:40,358
In 2016-17, their ranking was in 4th place.

337
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:42,067
That's not bad.

338
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,855
It had become a mid-level team.

339
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:47,910
And then came 2018, when its downfall began.

340
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,993
The thing is, each year, there's a summer break in Formula 1.

341
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,923
It is usually 2 weeks long.

342
00:15:52,923 --> 00:15:54,614
That year, in July 2018,

343
00:15:54,614 --> 00:15:56,241
just before the summer break,

344
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:59,405
documents were released as to how this company

345
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:02,301
had only $315,000 in the bank.

346
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:05,661
While it had taken out loans of $37 million.

347
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:07,875
This company owed a lot of money.

348
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,807
And you'd remember Vijay Mallya,

349
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:11,607
Vijay Mallya was accused

350
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:15,188
of owing about ₹100 billion to Indian banks.

351
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:17,545
In 2016, he fled from India,

352
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:19,486
and has been staying in the UK since then.

353
00:16:19,486 --> 00:16:22,949
A worldwide freezing order was issued on his assets,

354
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,914
he could not sell his assets.

355
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:27,200
And that banks could seize his assets.

356
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,966
It meant that if he wanted to sell the shares of this team,

357
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:33,343
he would need the consent of Indian banks.

358
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:36,588
Finally, a Canadian businessman Lawrence Stroll,

359
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:39,717
bought the team and its assets.

360
00:16:39,717 --> 00:16:42,280
at the cost of ₹9.6 billion.

361
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,532
Before the restart of the 2018 season.

362
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:47,675
The businessman Lawrence Stroll's son

363
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:51,045
Lance Stroll was a driver of this team in the F1.

364
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:55,038
FiA ordered that this team had to be renamed yet again

365
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:57,716
since the ownership was changing.

366
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,070
This was renamed Racing Point Force India.

367
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,627
The next year, in 2019, the word India was dropped from the name of the team,

368
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:06,481
And it became Racing Point.

369
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:09,728
In 2021, it was renamed one more time

370
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,166
Aston Martin F1 Team.

371
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:17,000
When Stroll purchased a 17% stake in this car manufacturing company.

372
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,969
In India, ED claims that

373
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:22,941
Vijay Mallya used his F1 and IPL teams for money laundering.

374
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:26,103
And Subrata Roy, owner of Sahara Pariwar,

375
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:29,078
had built his empire on scams.

376
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:32,625
Today, the Formula 1 sport is often criticised

377
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,275
as a useless sport.

378
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:36,253
That no one is benefiting from these car races.

379
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:39,387
And that it merely causes environmental pollution and nothing else.

380
00:17:39,387 --> 00:17:41,906
Perhaps, Some points of criticism are valid.

381
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:44,608
This is why Formula E has been introduced.

382
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:47,364
Wherein only electric cars would be racing.

383
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:48,569
About 10 years later,

384
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,988
a Formula E event was hosted in Hyderabad, India some months ago.

385
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,006
This event took place on a street circuit.

386
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:57,138
Race tracks weren't built for this.

387
00:17:57,138 --> 00:18:00,819
The existing roads were closed off

388
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,809
and prepared for this race.

389
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:04,214
Till 2039,

390
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:07,213
Formula E rights have been assigned by the FiA.

391
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:09,078
After which, it is expected that

392
00:18:09,078 --> 00:18:12,230
Formula 1 and Formula E would be merged. 

393
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,111
They will be one sport.

394
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:17,379
And only electric cars would be used for this race.

395
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:19,103
What do you think of this sport?
