00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,800
youtuber gaurav taneja aka flying 
beast made a tweet a few days back  

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,440
he's an iit graduate and i was surprised 
to see him buy into this kind of [ __ ]  

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,400
just goes to show no matter how educated you 
are you can still fall prey to it w're gonna look at  

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,920
this claim analyze where it comes from and talk 
about such religious science claims in general  

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,480
for those who don't know gaurav tanija which i 
think is very few of you his youtube channel is  

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,480
called flying beast he uploads daily vlogs and 
uses the cuteness of his children for clickbait  

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,560
this he has been criticized for a lot but whatever 
you might think he is a very skilled youtuber very  

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:47,280
well respected in the vlogging community his vlogs 
get a million plus views every day he has a loyal  

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,600
fan base and i expect this video to be getting 
a ton of dislikes soon but i must do what i do  

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,120
on this channel which is fight irrationality being 
spread by these pages but this time it's not just  

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:07,200
another huge youtube channel it's run by an iit 
kharagpur alumnus a qualified pilot a bodybuilder  

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,480
and someone who has recently gotten into studying 
law but no amount of education can remove the  

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,240
years of religious indoctrination as shown by 
this tweet but you know what let's not jump to  

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,480
conclusions let's actually analyze what he said in 
this tweet because hey you can make extraordinary  

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,200
claims you just have to back it up with 
extraordinary evidence let's see what evidence  

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,000
he actually provides two families survived the 
bhopal gas tragedy uh by doing agni hotra that's  

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,280
the fire ceremony that you can see him doing in 
this picture here now the bhopal gas tragedy was  

18
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,880
a factory accident that took place in 1984 where 
this highly toxic gas called mic methyl isocyanate  

19
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,400
leaked in the city of bhopal leaked into residence 
houses and thousands of people lost their lives  

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,960
now if you want to learn what led up to the 
accident and what happened after it i highly  

21
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,520
recommend dhruv rathee's video i've linked it 
in the description now where does this claim  

22
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,880
come from all sources point to a newspaper article 
that was apparently published in 1985 which talks  

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,880
about these two families that woke up in the on 
the night of the tragedy vomiting because of the  

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:26,960
poisonous gases toxic gases and instead of 
evacuating like any sane family would they decide  

25
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:34,880
to sit and do agnihotra and within 20 minutes 
their symptoms of gas parsoning vanished now  

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:42,560
how can that be possible when methyl isocyanate is 
flammable it burns producing even more toxic gases  

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,720
like hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide etc how 
on earth can you perform a fire ceremony in its  

28
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,960
presence hey in case you don't die by breathing 
in mic you can ensure that you burn your entire  

29
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,600
house down by doing this okay let's assume that 
the gas is not flammable or maybe it wasn't  

30
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:08,080
in sufficient enough quantity to catch fire 
noticeably even then there is a logical fallacy  

31
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,680
when you come to this conclusion when you say that 
the agni hotra is what saved the lives of those  

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:22,400
people let's see what it is we don't know how much 
of this claim is true especially given that mic is  

33
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,760
flammable this newspaper article sounds like a 
whatsapp forward by someone who wanted to use a  

34
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:35,920
tragedy involving the the deaths of thousands of 
people to promote their version of superiority of  

35
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,440
their religion even if you assume the details of 
the story to be true this conclusion that has been  

36
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:48,560
drawn has a logical flaw in it when you say that 
a happened and then b happened therefore a caused b  

37
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,200
you're mistaking correlation for causation the agni 
hotra and the families surviving the tragedy are  

38
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,120
two events that are correlated but if you conclude 
that they survived because of this agnihotra then  

39
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,080
you are committing this fallacy you're ignoring 
all the other factors that may have been bigger  

40
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,920
reasons for why they survived like how much of 
the toxic gas was in the air what was the airflow  

41
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,840
like that night with respect to the houses 
uh what was the wind speed and direction in  

42
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,720
the location and how far away was the house from 
the factory and how did all these factors affect  

43
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,200
how much toxic gases were in the air we shouldn't 
jump to conclusions without a clear knowledge of  

44
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,720
all these factors especially when the claim we're 
making is extraordinary like this extraordinary  

45
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,640
claims require extraordinary evidence i'm not 
rejecting the claim i'm simply not accepting it  

46
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,240
because there is no convincing evidence but when 
it comes to Gaurav Taneja's claims on the  

47
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,840
uh scientific superiority of the vedic scriptures 
it doesn't stop there let's see what else he said

48
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,840
in this video uploaded on august 8 2019 he talks 
about how although we see things from this lens 

49
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,240
of modern science in the world today as we 
get older and we learn more about the world we  

50
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,920
start losing our belief in modern science and 
we start trusting the vedas in our scriptures  

51
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,920
he says how there's all the science in the 
bhagavad-gita how it talks about atoms and  

52
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:29,360
electrons and protons which honestly is a load 
of bull[_] and i'll explain why science is a method  

53
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,840
it is not a body of knowledge it is not a list 
of facts and theories or our list of solutions  

54
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,360
to problems it is a way of thinking a way of 
learning things about the world primarily through  

55
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,120
observation a way of figuring out how true 
something is and if it should go in such a list  

56
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,880
or not i have an entire playlist on my channel 
on this scientific method feel free to watch  

57
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,240
now someone comes to me and says that there's 
this book from centuries ago which talks about  

58
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,600
atoms and electrons and protons and the theory of 
evolution and they figured all this out without  

59
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,440
using the scientific method then whatever that 
book says cannot be called scientific they may  

60
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,760
be true or false but definitely not scientific 
we learned about electrons and protons through  

61
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,080
careful experimentation and observation we learned 
about evolution through observation can you tell  

62
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,960
me back when the bhagavad-gita was written how 
could they have performed the experiments that led  

63
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,280
to those conclusions they couldn't have but pranav 
you ask if they weren't using the scientific  

64
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,520
method how were they right i have two answers for 
your question one given what you know today you  

65
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,680
try and force fit modern discoveries and try and 
find parallels that are there in the scriptures  

66
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,000
that match with modern discoveries modern theories 
modern facts that we discovered recently and you  

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,880
tend to ignore everything else that doesn't 
match with anything that we know today  

68
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,240
this is a combination of hindsight bias 
and confirmation bias the other reason is

69
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,160
imagine you're in a dark room somewhere in the 
room there is a dart board and you have a bunch  

70
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,920
of darts if you start throwing the darts what 
percentage of them will hit the mark a very  

71
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,600
low percentage right you can see how it's not 
zero percent even if you throw randomly in some  

72
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:28,000
direction you could hit the bullseye it's unlikely 
but you could hit it right now imagine if the room  

73
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,040
was dimly lit you can make out some details 
in the room you can see roughly where the dart  

74
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,760
board is and that helps you throw better making 
your throws get a higher percentage accuracy  

75
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,920
and what if the room was well lit your accuracy 
would go up tremendously right the chance of you  

76
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,280
not hitting the mark will only depend on how 
good or bad your aim is the same way back when  

77
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,480
these books were written if there are things that 
turned out to be factually correct in these books  

78
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,920
those small percentage of shorts in the 
dark that hit their mark a huge number  

79
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,120
of these statements are just plain false but you 
ignore them and pick only the ones that are true  

80
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,520
knowing what you know today and you call 
them scientific what logic is this things  

81
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,760
like ayurveda probably did a lot of trial 
and error before arriving at their results  

82
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,360
and they probably had better accuracy much 
like the dimly lit room from my example  

83
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,400
but simple trial and error is prone to a lot of 
mistakes which are overcome by modern medical  

84
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,240
trials i've gone to that extensively in this video 
plus we had no knowledge of germ theory before the  

85
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,880
17th century plus with advancements in chemistry 
and biology we know the mechanisms in which these  

86
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,880
medicines work and that has helped us design much 
more better medications for certain conditions  

87
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,920
we also have ways of evaluating the safety 
of medicines which we didn't have back then  

88
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,040
ayurveda may have achieved results many centuries 
ago doesn't mean it's the best tool we have today  

89
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,320
there is a very prevalent narrative that i whether 
superior to modern medicine i've heard many people  

90
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,000
say it please don't buy into it what we have today 
is like my third example a much brighter room of  

91
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,440
course we can miss but the chance of hitting 
are much much higher than anything we had in the  

92
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,040
past and plus you don't need to establish your 
religion cultural tradition as scientific only  

93
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,440
people with an inferiority complex will do that 
your culture is beautiful as it is don't embarrass  

94
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,480
yourself by posting tweets like this now there is 
a chance that he knew exactly what he was doing  

95
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,880
he didn't actually believe what he said but he 
said that only to please the uh his audience or  

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,920
he knew his audience really well and 
he knew the majority of his audience  

97
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,960
would like a post like that and that's why he 
posted it in which case i don't really have  

98
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,680
a lot to say about him he's just being really 
manipulative and if people don't recognize that  

99
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,080
they can fall to traps like these so yeah and 
the next time you see someone say some modern  

100
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,920
scientific fact is mentioned in scripture just 
remember they just shots in the dark some may hit  

101
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,360
the mark doesn't mean they were aimed i'll see you 
in the next one till then remember science is dope
