1
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,238
Have food.

2
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:48,362
Bunty, stop!

3
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:52,243
Bunty, where are you going? Stop!

4
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:54,192
Bunty, don't run!

5
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:37,208
Who's that?

6
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,740
Don't you know
this jungle is dangerous?

7
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,351
Man-eater tiger wanders in this forest.

8
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:47,631
Who are you?
I haven't seen you here before.

9
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:49,264
I'm coming from far away,

10
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:51,372
I want to meet Maheshwar.

11
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:54,354
I see.
Did the tiger enter your village too?

12
00:01:54,992 --> 00:01:56,116
A man-eater.

13
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,348
It took away all I had.

14
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,386
The tiger ate everything away.

15
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:05,327
Only Maheshwar can do something.

16
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,419
Come. This is my granddaughter.

17
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:15,983
Offer him water.

18
00:02:17,435 --> 00:02:18,677
My child,

19
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:21,907
don't walk around here.
Get inside.

20
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:26,365
Two years ago, this child's parents
were mauled to death by a tiger.

21
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:31,157
Before the crack of dawn,
Maheshwar killed the tiger with his spear.

22
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:32,992
I have heard a lot

23
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:36,229
about wild hunter Maheshwar.

24
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:38,493
If whatever I heard is true,

25
00:02:38,613 --> 00:02:40,439
then only Maheshwar can help me out.

26
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:44,650
Maheshwar will kill all the tigers.

27
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,902
Lord Krishnan killed Kans,
Lord Rama killed Ravana.

28
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:53,204
Maheshwar took incarnation
to destroy these man-eaters.

29
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:59,009
He was barely 9 years old
when he killed tiger for the first time.

30
00:03:13,268 --> 00:03:14,446
Maheshwar.

31
00:03:18,526 --> 00:03:19,650
Take.

32
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,007
Uncle, I have this with me.

33
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,095
Maheshwar's weapon is not a catapult,
but a spear.

34
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:43,549
Mom, look what uncle gave me.

35
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:46,987
Lord Maheshwar's spear.
- Alright.

36
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,836
Come on, have food.

37
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,129
You need to take food for father also.

38
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,141
My darling son.

39
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,302
Mom!

40
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,996
Father!

41
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:20,728
Mother...

42
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:26,069
Come on.
- Come on.

43
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,204
Hurry up.

44
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:31,913
Stop.

45
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,554
Eat, son. Don't cry.

46
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:47,818
Mahesh, stay with him.

47
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:53,752
You're stealing wood from the forest?

48
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:55,136
Hey!

49
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:57,546
Stop!
- Run!

50
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:59,298
Stop!
- Run!

51
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:00,509
Don't stop!

52
00:06:00,926 --> 00:06:02,158
Hey, stop!
- Stop!

53
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,515
Stop! Else you will die!
- Don't look back.

54
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:05,877
I say stop!

55
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,369
He must've gone there. Come on.
- Yes, sir.

56
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:16,507
Let's go.

57
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:00,544
Maheshwar...

58
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:02,598
Run.

59
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:16,216
Run.

60
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:21,212
Run away.

61
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:24,899
Run away.

62
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:28,412
Save your little brother's life.

63
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:30,556
Run!

64
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,757
No!

65
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,924
No!

66
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,230
Mahesh...

67
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,338
Eat something.

68
00:09:12,978 --> 00:09:14,438
I will kill it.

69
00:09:18,232 --> 00:09:20,167
I will kill the tiger.

70
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:32,300
"He is a fighter.
Everyone knows it."

71
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:42,311
"He doesn't miss his aim.
He is a real fighter."

72
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:44,222
Fasten it tightly.

73
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:54,659
What's going on?
What's the kid up to?

74
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,776
The tiger killed his father,

75
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,513
he wants revenge,
so, he has set up a trap.

76
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:09,361
The tiger that turns into a man-eater
never gets trapped.

77
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:13,945
If you want to kill it,
go to its den and drag it here,

78
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:15,718
that is the law of the forest.

79
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:36,368
Uncle!

80
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:04,572
Mahesh...

81
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:10,086
Mahesh, fast!

82
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:30,650
Mahesh...

83
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,023
"He's a fighter."

84
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,020
"He's a fighter."

85
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,420
"Everyone knows he's a fighter."

86
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:06,879
Ever since then,

87
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,455
he has not spared a single
man-eater tiger.

88
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:15,090
But Maheshwar is not here anymore.

89
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:18,168
The whole village is waiting for him.

90
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:20,818
But where did he go?

91
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:22,677
It's a big story.

92
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,079
A few days back,

93
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:27,905
Maheshwar's younger brother
Mani's friends had come to the village

94
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:30,001
to meet their uncle Balram.

95
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:31,645
How many more miles to go?

96
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:33,905
About 20-30 miles.

97
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:40,750
It's a wild elephant.
- Wild elephant?

98
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,345
Their menace will be there
for another 7-8 miles.

99
00:13:43,604 --> 00:13:46,641
After that, we'll be free of elephants.

100
00:13:46,761 --> 00:13:49,200
Then on, there are only tigers.

101
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,704
Man-eaters.

102
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:53,883
But if tiger comes in front,

103
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:56,715
there's no need to get scared at all.
- Why?

104
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,505
For it will kill us for sure.

105
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,825
Then why get scared?

106
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:03,857
Shut up and drive.
Don't scare the hell out of me.

107
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,117
It's too cold today.

108
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:12,544
This is your room.

109
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:17,149
Did you have dinner?
Or you need something to eat?

110
00:14:17,446 --> 00:14:20,396
What's available?
- Dried fish chutney and rice.

111
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:22,072
You want to have?

112
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,169
Where is the bathroom?
- That one, there.

113
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:26,331
He is naming the dishes.
- There's lot of dust in the room.

114
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:27,628
Nobody comes here.

115
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,938
Dust the bedspread before you sleep,

116
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:32,504
you'll get rid of snakes and scorpions.
- Over here?

117
00:14:32,624 --> 00:14:33,550
Yes.

118
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,080
Oh, my God! Ghost! Save me!

119
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,346
What's wrong?
- Shiva, there's ghost in the bathroom.

120
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:48,335
Come on.
- Don't go there.

121
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:50,995
It looks scary, I saw it myself.

122
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:54,292
That may be Sashi.
- Does Sashi lives with the ghost?

123
00:14:54,372 --> 00:14:57,098
It's not ghost,
it's Sashi, he lives in this village.

124
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:59,423
He's a peeping tom.

125
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:01,088
Don't be scared.

126
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:03,034
Don't talk nonsense.

127
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,399
I am not attracted to men.

128
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:11,253
Are there no ladies?
- No.

129
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:12,792
Very waste of time.

130
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,583
Well, don't repeat this.
Let's go.

131
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,883
Let's introduce ourselves to each other.
I'm Sashi, I'm a hunter.

132
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,515
You wouldn't have heard about me.

133
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:26,006
The animals in the forest
are scared of me.

134
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,439
Come, we shall sit and discuss.

135
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:31,358
Don't be frightened.

136
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:33,141
I don't fire at humans.

137
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:35,779
Let me know if you need something.

138
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:38,781
We have brought everything.
- Very good. Then get it.

139
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:43,159
Security, get three tumblers and water.

140
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,800
Did you see?
The villagers respect me a lot.

141
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,248
Oh, God! Liquor!

142
00:15:51,973 --> 00:15:53,508
Everyone wants to drink for free.

143
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:56,583
Sashi, do you know Balram?

144
00:15:58,175 --> 00:16:01,913
So, you're here to buy firecrackers
to drive the wild boars?

145
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:03,905
He is very close to me.

146
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:06,975
Balram's crackers are really good.

147
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:09,687
If you set fire to 10,
at least one will burst for sure.

148
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:12,908
Will I be able to meet him now?
- No. No point seeing him today.

149
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:16,521
He will be drunk now,
meet him in the morning.

150
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,094
This is an international hotel
of our great village.

151
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:21,834
Tigers don't visit this place,

152
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,564
hence people come here to eat food.

153
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,251
Hey, get going.

154
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:26,937
You're here again
to have food for free.

155
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,832
Don't be scared.

156
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:30,763
Mr. Ramu, three cups of tea.

157
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:32,443
One bit strong, like me.

158
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,265
Sashi, who are they?

159
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:37,957
My friends from the town.
- I see.

160
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:42,337
Ramkali, I have an advice for you.
If you've quarreled with your husband,

161
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,623
you can have me.
- Shut up!

162
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:48,996
Rascal!
- I just hate Indians.

163
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,141
He is just disgusting.

164
00:16:51,221 --> 00:16:52,654
Sashi.
- Yes.

165
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:56,330
I think you'll be beaten up
by the women of the village someday.

166
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,563
The women are scared
to also take a shower because of him.

167
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,844
He is such a shameless man.
- Just ignore him.

168
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:08,579
Why is the village head
coming here with the villagers?

169
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,318
What's wrong, sir?
What brings you here?

170
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:13,150
Tiger entered our shanty last night.

171
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,886
Then?
- It took away Chinu's daughter Chameli.

172
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:18,113
We want to see Maheshwar.

173
00:17:18,923 --> 00:17:21,884
Sir, it's not Maheshwar's duty.

174
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:27,624
The one who has to do this job
is eating free breakfast inside.

175
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:31,016
We can't do anything unless
we receive orders from the government.

176
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:34,174
As if you will turn down the mountains
if you receive orders.

177
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:35,785
I cannot do anything alone, Sashi.

178
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:39,742
I can't fight with the man-eaters
with a mere baton.

179
00:17:39,822 --> 00:17:43,218
I have three daughters,
and I am retiring in six months.

180
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:44,516
I don't wish to die.

181
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:49,003
And everyone knows that Maheshwar has
more experience than the forest officials.

182
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,850
Only Maheshwar can trap the tiger.

183
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,051
Lord, everything lies in Your hands now.

184
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:58,743
Help us get rid of the man-eater.

185
00:17:58,823 --> 00:18:01,003
What will God do?
It's the job of the government.

186
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,149
The government will do nothing.

187
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:04,762
Only Maheshwar can save us.
Only he'll be able to do something.

188
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:07,584
He had rescued us
from the tiger earlier too.

189
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:11,141
Only Maheshwar can rescue us
from the man-eaters.

190
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,838
Who is Maheshwar?

191
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:15,764
Do you want to know who Maheshwar is?

192
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,958
Yes.
- He is the celebrity of the jungle.

193
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:22,131
He's the nephew of Balram.

194
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:26,048
If the tiger enters the village,
it becomes Maheshwar's prey.

195
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:27,681
This is Balram's work shop.

196
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:30,373
These four boys are his sons.

197
00:18:30,453 --> 00:18:32,221
It's a happy family.

198
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:34,794
My child, where is your father?

199
00:18:36,264 --> 00:18:38,470
He must be in the toddy shop,
go check there.

200
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:41,544
Let's go. They are able children.

201
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:44,831
Balram's mother-in-law Bhavani
owns this work shop.

202
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:48,248
Balram used to buy
raw materials from Bhavani,

203
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:51,356
the loan amount was so much that
she got her daughter married to Balram.

204
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:53,421
and compensated those debts for dowry.

205
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,885
Ms. Bhavani.
She has great concerns for me.

206
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:57,971
Ms. Bhavani.
- Shut up!

207
00:18:58,091 --> 00:19:00,004
To heck with you.

208
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:01,890
Where is your son-in-law?

209
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,004
He must be in the work shop.
- Only your grandsons are there.

210
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,539
He's not in the work shop?
- No.

211
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:10,366
Oh, my God!
Then, he must be at home.

212
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:12,110
I got to rush to his house.

213
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,980
Step aside.
He won't stop begetting children.

214
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,645
Why did she run screaming?
- I told you it's a happy family.

215
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,284
Balram begot children
just like hen lays eggs.

216
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:26,824
Geeta, have you lost your mind?
Quickly open the door!

217
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:28,867
I know he's inside.

218
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,792
Nobody would come out if you scream.

219
00:19:30,872 --> 00:19:33,603
Let me peep in and
see what's happening inside.

220
00:19:33,683 --> 00:19:35,257
There is a hole on the window
in the back side.

221
00:19:35,337 --> 00:19:36,389
Shut up!

222
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:38,561
Don't you hear me?
I've been calling out!

223
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:42,929
She's at it all the time.
- I will... Call him out.

224
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:51,614
Why do you pay attention to her?

225
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:54,620
Listen, one of the legs
of the cot is broken,

226
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,562
get it fixed by the carpenter.

227
00:19:56,642 --> 00:20:00,270
Make it quick, I can't wait. Understand?
- Shut up!

228
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:04,117
Oh, my God!
Perhaps I've to look after one more baby.

229
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:06,417
What's the problem in that?

230
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,189
What else you have to do?
- I said shut up! Idiot!

231
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:12,757
It is so much fun to see
the old woman get annoyed.

232
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,584
It's a daily routine.

233
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:16,216
Aren't you satisfied seeing it?

234
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:20,521
Sashi, who are they?

235
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:23,743
My friends from town,
they're here to meet you.

236
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,274
Actually, we are Mani's friends.

237
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:29,301
Really? Please come.
- Come.

238
00:20:29,906 --> 00:20:32,328
My name is Badrinath,
people call me Badri.

239
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:33,809
And I'm Shiva.

240
00:20:34,014 --> 00:20:35,636
We need a favour.

241
00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:37,277
Anything important?

242
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,477
Mani has gone
to a faraway place to study,

243
00:20:40,557 --> 00:20:42,617
but I've never even
stepped out of this village.

244
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:44,228
Balram, it's Mani.

245
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,060
Mani.
- Uncle.

246
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,065
How are you?
- What's going on? Give my phone.

247
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:52,184
Wait a minute, please.
- Mani,

248
00:20:52,264 --> 00:20:54,011
your friends are here.

249
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:55,200
I only sent them there.

250
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,032
The guy with dark complexion
is my classmate.

251
00:20:58,112 --> 00:20:59,989
The guy with dark complexion?

252
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:01,773
Why have you sent him to me?

253
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:03,135
They need a favour.

254
00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:05,470
Only you can help them, Uncle.

255
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,814
How can I help them?

256
00:21:06,894 --> 00:21:09,576
There is an herbal medicine factory
called Giriraj Pharmacy.

257
00:21:09,824 --> 00:21:13,900
And Shiva's Father,
Dada Giriraj is the owner of the factory.

258
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:16,721
Dada Giriraj, it's a strange name.

259
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:18,369
With the help of a scientist,

260
00:21:18,489 --> 00:21:20,740
they've discovered medicine
to prevent cancer.

261
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,090
Oh.

262
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,610
The medicine is good and effective,
but to mix the ingredients together

263
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:29,729
they need marijuana.

264
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:32,444
Marijuana?
- Uncle, talk softly.

265
00:21:32,898 --> 00:21:35,287
If this medicine works out,
it will be sold everywhere.

266
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:37,741
I will also get a good job
in that factory.

267
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:39,679
Dada Giriraj also promised me.

268
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:44,370
I can do anything for Mani's happiness.

269
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,382
And let me tell you something.

270
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:49,473
Mani's happiness
is Mahesh's happiness.

271
00:21:49,593 --> 00:21:52,283
And Mahesh's happiness
is my happiness.

272
00:21:52,403 --> 00:21:55,235
The village head often tells me that

273
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,646
the treasure of medicines
lies in this forest.

274
00:21:57,726 --> 00:22:01,827
But it's amazing that marijuana
is used for prevention of cancer.

275
00:22:02,205 --> 00:22:04,125
Watch out, it's slippery.

276
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:06,000
Watch out. Come.

277
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,038
We walked for 2 hours
in this dense forest,

278
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:10,249
but we still haven't reached.

279
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,468
How much long will it take?
- Still a long way to go.

280
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:14,614
Keep walking.

281
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:22,443
What a pleasant surprise!

282
00:22:22,865 --> 00:22:25,784
Who are they?
- They are my friends.

283
00:22:25,864 --> 00:22:28,292
I want to buy stuff from Rambo.

284
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:31,665
You know he doesn't
deal with strangers.

285
00:22:31,745 --> 00:22:34,144
I know,
but I told you they are my friends.

286
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:36,046
Alright, I will talk to him,

287
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:38,544
and that's because they are your friends.
I will talk to him right away.

288
00:22:47,393 --> 00:22:49,793
Normally I won't have
any dealings with India.

289
00:22:49,873 --> 00:22:50,831
It's risky.

290
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,769
Most of my business is from Singapore,

291
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:54,347
then to Europe.

292
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:57,201
My assistant requested me,
so I'm talking to you,

293
00:22:57,558 --> 00:22:59,796
but the stuff will be delivered
to you only for once.

294
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:03,736
Okay.
- And it will take two weeks.

295
00:23:03,963 --> 00:23:06,446
Two weeks?
- Plants are in the harvesting stage,

296
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:08,252
they only need to be cut and dried.

297
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,803
The stuff will be delivered
to you in the village.

298
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,912
Then, it's your risk.

299
00:23:14,404 --> 00:23:17,626
Walk fast, we need to move
out of this forest before dusk.

300
00:23:17,706 --> 00:23:21,237
It will take the same amount of time
to get back to the village.

301
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,844
What's wrong?

302
00:23:30,924 --> 00:23:32,196
It's flooded here.

303
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:35,234
We will have to take the other route.
- Is it?

304
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:36,650
Come quickly.

305
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,334
Come on.
- Come on.

306
00:23:40,647 --> 00:23:41,915
Why do you look worried?

307
00:23:42,035 --> 00:23:44,734
A man-eater has been wandering
in the route we've taken.

308
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:46,680
It has killed four people till now.

309
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,604
By saying this,
I didn't want to scare you.

310
00:23:49,684 --> 00:23:50,988
Walk fast.

311
00:23:51,161 --> 00:23:52,674
Mahesh is not to be seen
past couple of days.

312
00:23:52,754 --> 00:23:55,063
Had he accompanied us,
things would've been different.

313
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,236
By the way, there will be
many tigers in the forest.

314
00:23:57,316 --> 00:23:59,642
How'd Maheshwar know
as to which tiger needs to be killed?

315
00:23:59,722 --> 00:24:02,193
You don't have much knowledge
about the forest.

316
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:05,667
Every tiger has its own territory.

317
00:24:05,787 --> 00:24:09,209
And a tiger will not enter
into another tiger's territory.

318
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,998
Come on.
- Give me your hand.

319
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,307
Quick.

320
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,845
It's not going to be easy.

321
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:20,511
There is no other way
to get to the village.

322
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:23,069
We'll have to get out
of the forest before dusk.

323
00:24:23,189 --> 00:24:24,400
Understand?
- Come on.

324
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:27,722
Come on.

325
00:24:57,571 --> 00:25:00,815
Balram.
- Move back.

326
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:04,643
Run!
- Balram!

327
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:09,453
My God!

328
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:12,016
It's coming after us!
- Run!

329
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:14,996
Stop!
- Badri!

330
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:16,953
Oh, my God!

331
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:25,060
You don't have to fear anymore,

332
00:25:26,228 --> 00:25:28,639
Maheshwar is here.

333
00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:50,498
"He is a fighter.
Everyone knows it."

334
00:25:53,277 --> 00:26:00,555
"He doesn't miss his aim.
He is a real fighter."

335
00:28:19,997 --> 00:28:26,988
"He is a fighter.
Everyone knows it."

336
00:28:29,702 --> 00:28:36,892
"He doesn't miss his aim.
He is a real fighter."

337
00:29:53,928 --> 00:29:54,922
What's wrong?

338
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,246
Why do you look upset?

339
00:29:57,731 --> 00:29:59,389
I got news from the village.

340
00:29:59,521 --> 00:30:01,240
You killed a tiger.

341
00:30:01,921 --> 00:30:03,478
You promised me, didn't you?

342
00:30:06,494 --> 00:30:09,564
What rubbish are you talking?
- I am not talking rubbish.

343
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:10,980
You killed the tiger, didn't you?

344
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,547
tiger? Which tiger?

345
00:30:12,627 --> 00:30:14,947
Stop pretending.

346
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:18,224
The punishment for killing tiger
is imprisonment.

347
00:30:18,304 --> 00:30:20,397
Nothing of that sort. Come on.

348
00:30:20,678 --> 00:30:23,154
Let go. Don't coax me.
Where were you for the last two days?

349
00:30:23,234 --> 00:30:25,932
I was in the fields. I told you, didn't I?
- Father!

350
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:27,316
Yes.

351
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:29,308
Chakki!

352
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:32,378
I know where you had been.

353
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:34,941
If the forest officials interrogate you,

354
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:36,897
you will see my true colour.

355
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,492
I know what your true colour is.

356
00:30:40,596 --> 00:30:43,352
Show me your true colour for once,

357
00:30:43,432 --> 00:30:44,985
Chakki will get a company.

358
00:30:45,065 --> 00:30:46,650
You're so shameless.

359
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,540
Dad, is mother really like a lioness?
- Yes.

360
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,031
I really so scared of your mother.

361
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:57,989
Behalf yourself.
- My father is as brave as a lion.

362
00:31:07,317 --> 00:31:08,258
Go inside.

363
00:31:08,842 --> 00:31:10,128
Come, sir.

364
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:11,879
Chakki, Babita is here.

365
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,630
Go play with her.

366
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,836
What brings you here?

367
00:31:16,063 --> 00:31:18,809
Villagers are having sleepless nights.

368
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:21,280
The tiger has killed
four people till now.

369
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,950
You must come for our protection.

370
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,345
We have nobody else.

371
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,837
Don't worry.

372
00:31:27,258 --> 00:31:28,967
The tiger will never
enter our village hereafter,

373
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:30,253
it won't kill anyone.

374
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:32,465
It's my promise.

375
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:36,886
Even if the tiger comes,
only you can rescue us.

376
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:38,335
You're our belief.

377
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:41,794
God has made you our messiah.

378
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,626
Come on, sir. You go.

379
00:31:44,746 --> 00:31:48,399
When I am here,
no tiger will enter our village.

380
00:31:48,822 --> 00:31:50,000
Be rest assured.

381
00:31:57,727 --> 00:31:59,786
Did you tell him you won't
let the tiger enter the village?

382
00:31:59,906 --> 00:32:02,393
That's right.
I was just giving him hope.

383
00:32:02,473 --> 00:32:05,362
I know what you will do. Enough is enough.
Come on, Chakki.

384
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:07,677
Your father doesn't care about us.

385
00:32:07,757 --> 00:32:10,131
Let go.
- Maina, I am hungry, stop quarreling.

386
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:12,726
Have you ever thought about us?
You're only concerned about the villagers.

387
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,017
You will even sacrifice your life for them.

388
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:17,103
Have you ever realized
what'd happen to us if you die? - Maina...

389
00:32:18,195 --> 00:32:19,276
Darn it.

390
00:32:21,168 --> 00:32:23,816
Shiva, look there.
It looks like a city car.

391
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:26,319
You're right.

392
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,124
It's Mr. Sharma's car.

393
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:30,221
Come on.
- You recognize the car.

394
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:31,292
Hey.

395
00:32:34,113 --> 00:32:36,496
She's Mr. Sharma's wife. Hide.

396
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,004
She belongs to our hometown.

397
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,799
She's Julie,
the only daughter of the landlord.

398
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:45,819
She married a person in our hometown.
She lives nearby. - Is it?

399
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:47,343
Then, let me warn you.

400
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:50,294
I once ogled at her accidentally,

401
00:32:50,374 --> 00:32:53,148
her father battered me to pulp.

402
00:32:53,228 --> 00:32:55,981
Just for ogling?
- Yes, I saw her bathing.

403
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,843
Oh, my God.
- Turn around.

404
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:06,778
Driver, pull over.

405
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:08,574
Driver, can't you hear?

406
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,142
Pull over.
- Okay, sir.

407
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,769
Take.

408
00:33:20,947 --> 00:33:22,212
Chakki.
- Yes.

409
00:33:23,466 --> 00:33:25,682
I have brought chocolate for you.

410
00:33:25,762 --> 00:33:27,813
Sir, tell me something.

411
00:33:27,893 --> 00:33:29,557
Why does ma'am meet that little girl?

412
00:33:29,637 --> 00:33:30,757
Who is she?

413
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,974
I've no idea.
- Ma'am is your wife.

414
00:33:35,201 --> 00:33:37,255
Being her husband,
why don't you ask her?

415
00:33:37,335 --> 00:33:40,063
I could never muster courage
to ask her.

416
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,652
Just ignore it.

417
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:42,755
Where is your father?

418
00:33:42,835 --> 00:33:46,095
He has gone out,
he'll be back only at night.

419
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:50,542
Tell your father I was here.
- Who are you talking to, Chakki?

420
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:07,360
Brother!
- Mani!

421
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:11,179
How was your exam?
- Have I ever failed in exams?

422
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:12,541
And you will never fail.

423
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:16,358
Come. You must be hungry.
- I was famished, I had eggs.

424
00:34:16,574 --> 00:34:17,701
How many eggs did you have?
- Two eggs.

425
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:19,177
Only two eggs?

426
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,328
Let's have lunch together. Hop on.

427
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,788
Oh. Brother, you still serve the villagers.

428
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:29,633
Mani, they are not just villagers,

429
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:30,996
they are our family.

430
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:32,660
If tiger enters the village,
they need you,

431
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,541
they need you for everything.

432
00:34:34,621 --> 00:34:37,965
Amid this, do you find time
for your personal affairs?

433
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:40,365
Mother passed away
soon after she birthed you.

434
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,982
Father also died
trying to rescue us from the tiger.

435
00:34:43,062 --> 00:34:46,917
Do you know because of whom
you and I are successful?

436
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:48,117
It's because of the villagers.

437
00:34:48,197 --> 00:34:52,666
My service to them is no match
to what they did for us.

438
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:54,374
Okay.

439
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:56,115
Tell me something, Mani.

440
00:34:56,195 --> 00:35:00,212
Your friends are staying
in the guesthouse here.

441
00:35:00,886 --> 00:35:02,637
They don't appear to be good.

442
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:05,718
They are really good, Brother.
They are Dada Giriraj's boys.

443
00:35:05,798 --> 00:35:08,075
Dada Giriraj is a bigwig in Mangalpur.

444
00:35:08,155 --> 00:35:10,291
His company is conducting
an experiment in medical.

445
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:12,551
If the experiment is successful,
I will also prosper.

446
00:35:12,631 --> 00:35:14,097
He has promised to give me job.

447
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,253
Is that so?
- Yes.

448
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:18,194
In that case, I will help him too.

449
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:19,978
Let's go meet them.

450
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,301
Who's that?

451
00:35:25,593 --> 00:35:27,128
Who's that?

452
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:31,167
It's my nephew, Maheshwar.

453
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:35,718
Oh, my God! tiger!

454
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:42,920
Sir,

455
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,752
you appear like a tiger to me.

456
00:35:45,832 --> 00:35:47,709
You're absolutely right.

457
00:35:47,789 --> 00:35:50,585
That's Shiva.
- Mani told me about you.

458
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:53,201
Maheshwar, sit.
- I am fine.

459
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:55,464
Hi.
- Mani?

460
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:56,999
When did you come?
- Just now.

461
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,899
Come, nephew.
- Uncle!

462
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:00,514
How are you?

463
00:36:02,582 --> 00:36:04,926
Get tumbler for Maheshwar quickly.
- Wait.

464
00:36:05,473 --> 00:36:07,062
That's imported liquor.

465
00:36:07,142 --> 00:36:10,360
I don't like imported liquor.
I have mine in the lorry.

466
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,760
I will go get it.
- Come on, Mahesh.

467
00:36:14,616 --> 00:36:17,200
I liked his style very much.
What do you think, Shiva?

468
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,194
Mahesh is still childish.

469
00:36:20,314 --> 00:36:23,502
He can also sacrifice
his life for a friend,

470
00:36:23,622 --> 00:36:25,258
but he doesn't

471
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:28,134
spare those who betray him.

472
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,274
Never.

473
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:36,076
Mahesh, you will never change.

474
00:36:36,156 --> 00:36:38,141
You prefer to drink only toddy.

475
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:39,503
Have a drink.
- No.

476
00:36:39,827 --> 00:36:41,741
No one would find out.

477
00:36:41,957 --> 00:36:44,260
Come on.
- What is that?

478
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:45,799
He was...

479
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:46,977
What's going on?

480
00:36:47,057 --> 00:36:49,918
I was telling Mani to have a drink.
- I will kill you.

481
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:51,832
He is still so young.

482
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:53,950
Mani won't drink liquor.

483
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:56,318
He won't smoke cigarette too.

484
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,527
He will drink only tea.

485
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:00,300
Mani, take the lorry and go.

486
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:03,316
Deliver the stuffs to the people.
- Okay.

487
00:37:03,396 --> 00:37:06,365
And stay out of my
mother-in-law's sight.

488
00:37:06,445 --> 00:37:08,773
What will you tell my wife about me?
- I don't know.

489
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:12,125
Tell her you didn't meet me
nor did I drink liquor.

490
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,752
Other than Mahesh,

491
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:18,452
only one person can drive his lorry

492
00:37:18,532 --> 00:37:20,020
and that's Mani.

493
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,939
Uncle, you know I was very young
when I purchased the lorry.

494
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:25,977
Mani and the lorry are my children.
They are like my life.

495
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:27,187
You know something?

496
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:30,078
Mani has been offered a job.
- Yes, he told me.

497
00:37:30,158 --> 00:37:33,861
Uncle, I never thought our village
would contribute in fighting

498
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:36,012
a dangerous disease like cancer.

499
00:37:36,132 --> 00:37:37,584
When the product
is launched in the market,

500
00:37:37,704 --> 00:37:40,207
all the credit will go to Mani.

501
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:43,029
He will be the marketing manager
of Giriraj Pharmacy.

502
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:48,131
Thank you very much.

503
00:37:48,251 --> 00:37:49,865
I'm living only for him.

504
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:52,644
Without him, my life is meaningless.

505
00:37:52,764 --> 00:37:55,450
What are you saying.
We just need your support.

506
00:37:56,591 --> 00:37:59,142
Sure.
- I present you deer meat.

507
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,091
What? What did you say?

508
00:38:02,437 --> 00:38:03,550
It's mutton.

509
00:38:03,874 --> 00:38:05,896
Deer meat?
- No, it's kid meat.

510
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:08,608
What?
- Kid meat.

511
00:38:08,728 --> 00:38:11,025
Did you kill deer?
- How's it possible?

512
00:38:11,145 --> 00:38:13,480
It's a crime. It's mixed mutton,

513
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,129
just like mixed vegetables.

514
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:17,671
He thinks I am a fool.

515
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:19,545
I know the difference between
deer meat and mutton.

516
00:38:20,024 --> 00:38:21,537
It took me lot of effort
to catch the deer,

517
00:38:21,657 --> 00:38:22,900
taste the meat, please.

518
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,213
Get going.
- Get going.

519
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:28,922
The doll starts dancing
when you press this button.

520
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,213
What's wrong, Sister-in-law?
Why are you silent?

521
00:38:32,862 --> 00:38:33,954
Nothing!

522
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:36,851
Brother neither went to guest house,

523
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:39,154
nor touched drinks!

524
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,689
Even you're lying to me.
Your brother instructed you, right?

525
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:45,823
Let he return,
I won't let him inside the house.

526
00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:50,127
Careful. I can't assure you
that you can stay in my house.

527
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:52,869
Still, there's nothing wrong to try.

528
00:38:52,949 --> 00:38:55,258
It's possible Maina might agree.

529
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:57,636
Mani, had dinner?
- Yes. - Good boy!

530
00:38:59,074 --> 00:39:01,080
Where is Maina?
- She's inside.

531
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,387
You sleep.
Uncle, you also sleep.

532
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:10,922
Where is Chakki?

533
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:16,653
I already finished my dinner!
Didn't you have?

534
00:39:18,577 --> 00:39:19,745
Maina.

535
00:39:20,372 --> 00:39:21,334
Maina,

536
00:39:21,755 --> 00:39:24,704
why are you silent?
Vow of silence?

537
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:28,866
You're so drunk that you're swaying,
what should I talk?

538
00:39:28,986 --> 00:39:31,566
I am standing straight.

539
00:39:32,142 --> 00:39:36,256
Watch there! It is uncle
who is walking on four legs!

540
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:41,111
Look at him.
- It's done.

541
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:47,292
It is so mischievous.
It came this side. I'll roll it again.

542
00:39:47,412 --> 00:39:51,544
Come on. Get straight.

543
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:55,134
Are you missing me?

544
00:39:56,453 --> 00:39:58,927
Wait.

545
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:00,625
Now it is okay.

546
00:40:02,658 --> 00:40:04,254
Where are you going? Come on.

547
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:05,583
Where are you going?
- I will thrash you.

548
00:40:05,663 --> 00:40:08,106
Dad, I want to give you chocolates.
- My child.

549
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:10,202
Give all those chocolates
to your father.

550
00:40:10,322 --> 00:40:11,391
Which chocolate?

551
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:15,045
Lovely chocolates!

552
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:16,268
Who gave this? Your Uncle?

553
00:40:16,348 --> 00:40:18,019
No, ma'am gave this.

554
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:20,949
Which ma'am?
- The lady who came in a car.

555
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:23,582
What?

556
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:25,549
Why are you pretending to
spit it before me?

557
00:40:25,629 --> 00:40:27,074
You meet her stealthily.

558
00:40:27,154 --> 00:40:29,528
You still have a chance
to go stay with her.

559
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:32,071
We both will live our life.

560
00:40:32,151 --> 00:40:35,058
I didn't even speak to her.
Why are you saying so?

561
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:37,836
Oh, do you wish to talk to her?

562
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:40,301
Then, go and talk to her.

563
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,582
She must be anxiously
waiting for you.

564
00:40:42,662 --> 00:40:46,286
Julie ma'am asked me to inform
you that she'll come to meet you.

565
00:40:46,366 --> 00:40:48,200
You're my darling daughter, right?

566
00:40:49,043 --> 00:40:51,346
Please don't add fuel to fire.

567
00:40:51,426 --> 00:40:53,421
She could go in the car,

568
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:55,238
what was the need for her
to take a walk from here?

569
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:57,422
She will pass by our house.

570
00:40:57,502 --> 00:40:58,698
I know that

571
00:40:58,778 --> 00:41:00,644
she wants to meet you.

572
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:01,671
What are you saying?

573
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,449
I am not blind.
I was mad to marry you.

574
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:06,880
What is going on here? What is
the problem? - Julie ma'am.

575
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,080
Julie ma'am?

576
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,973
Why are you interfering?
Dare you mention her name.

577
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:12,130
Go to bed.

578
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:14,011
Why are you still awake?

579
00:41:14,091 --> 00:41:16,793
Who is Julie?
- What do I tell you?

580
00:41:16,873 --> 00:41:18,469
She's a nuisance.

581
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:20,826
It happened 7-8 years ago.

582
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:23,517
You were pursuing your studies
in the city that time.

583
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:25,561
During that time,

584
00:41:26,912 --> 00:41:28,588
I had fallen in love with her.

585
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:39,326
'How are you?'

586
00:41:39,406 --> 00:41:40,947
'Why are you teasing her?'

587
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,726
'If you love her so much

588
00:41:43,806 --> 00:41:46,093
why don't you ask her
for marriage? Don't you have guts?'

589
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:47,251
'I do have courage.'

590
00:41:47,597 --> 00:41:50,019
'I become feeble on seeing her!
- Shut up.'

591
00:41:50,213 --> 00:41:51,413
'Stop the lorry.'

592
00:41:51,493 --> 00:41:53,294
'Get down. Get down I say.
- What, Uncle?'

593
00:41:54,105 --> 00:41:56,083
'Go and propose to her.'

594
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,611
'What do I ask her?'

595
00:41:57,691 --> 00:41:59,383
'Ask her if she'll marry you.'

596
00:41:59,503 --> 00:42:00,930
'I will ask her tomorrow.'

597
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,054
'No! Ask right away.'

598
00:42:02,134 --> 00:42:04,681
'What's the hurry.
- Shall I kick you? Go.'

599
00:42:13,795 --> 00:42:14,951
'Uncle...
- You came back?'

600
00:42:15,031 --> 00:42:16,746
'I might goof up in haste.'

601
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,388
'I'll ask her after 2-3 days.
- I will thrash you. Go.'

602
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:26,923
'What is it?
- Nothing.'

603
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,664
'Then, move from the way.'

604
00:42:29,703 --> 00:42:31,130
'He blocked the way.'

605
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:34,979
'Go.'

606
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:38,395
'Listen, Maina.'

607
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,291
'Don't be alone.
- What?'

608
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:44,907
'It will be better if you get married.'

609
00:42:44,987 --> 00:42:46,723
'Marry whom?
- Anyone.'

610
00:42:46,803 --> 00:42:47,869
'Oh.'

611
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:50,118
'You quit driver job and took
over marriage broker job?'

612
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,851
'No!
- Move aside! You coward.'

613
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:00,656
'What did you tell him?
- Go and ask him.'

614
00:43:03,222 --> 00:43:04,920
'What happened?
Did she agree? - Yes.'

615
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,180
'Did you ask her?
- Yes.'

616
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,233
'What did she say?'

617
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:11,595
'She said I was a coward.'

618
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:15,001
'What? Arrogant woman.'

619
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:17,286
'Hey, my nephew.'

620
00:43:17,406 --> 00:43:19,833
'You're not a coward.
- Uncle.'

621
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,936
Hold it properly.

622
00:43:24,016 --> 00:43:27,360
Come on, put it here.
Pull it.

623
00:43:28,171 --> 00:43:30,668
Enough.
- Pull it.

624
00:43:30,748 --> 00:43:32,084
Hey.
- Pull it!

625
00:43:32,164 --> 00:43:34,582
Come on, put force.

626
00:43:35,127 --> 00:43:36,792
Yes, it's coming.

627
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,565
Let it go.

628
00:43:40,024 --> 00:43:42,576
Where are you lost?

629
00:43:43,235 --> 00:43:44,608
Forgive me.

630
00:43:44,796 --> 00:43:46,180
Come on, pull it.

631
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,083
Very good.
- Listen, Nephew.

632
00:43:48,163 --> 00:43:50,126
I think something is fishy.

633
00:43:50,206 --> 00:43:51,599
What happened?
Did you have a flat tyre?

634
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:54,548
Yes, there's a flat tyre.
- Where?

635
00:43:54,628 --> 00:43:56,433
Someone's heart has gone flat.
- What do you mean?

636
00:43:56,513 --> 00:43:58,292
Look there..
- Where?

637
00:43:58,372 --> 00:44:00,184
Look there.

638
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:02,681
Did you see?

639
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:06,184
Is she watching me?
- Yes.

640
00:44:06,566 --> 00:44:08,764
She's been staring at you constantly.

641
00:44:08,884 --> 00:44:11,078
You don't get such opportunities.

642
00:44:11,198 --> 00:44:14,451
She's boss's only daughter.
Utilize this opportunity.

643
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:16,286
You'll hit jackpot.

644
00:44:16,674 --> 00:44:18,513
You know the rest.

645
00:44:21,045 --> 00:44:22,494
Why are you showing attitude?

646
00:44:25,035 --> 00:44:27,110
Uncle, I like that slim girl.

647
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,418
Who?
- The one who's coming from there.

648
00:44:30,607 --> 00:44:31,623
She?

649
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:37,353
Get me some water.

650
00:44:37,882 --> 00:44:39,633
Can I get some water?

651
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:46,195
Stand straight.

652
00:44:46,275 --> 00:44:48,021
You can never become rich.

653
00:44:48,141 --> 00:44:51,844
You could get her easily,
but you want this girl.

654
00:44:51,964 --> 00:44:53,279
Uncle.
- What is it?

655
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,912
She's getting water for me.

656
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,104
Take bath.

657
00:44:56,184 --> 00:44:58,659
Maina, give it to me.
I will give to him.

658
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:01,516
Fatso interrupted.
- You still stand a chance.

659
00:45:01,596 --> 00:45:03,526
You'll become the owner
of this estate.

660
00:45:10,402 --> 00:45:13,373
You're the hero and messiah
of the villagers, right?

661
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:15,201
Nothing as such.

662
00:45:18,379 --> 00:45:21,336
He's not thirsty for water,
but something else.

663
00:45:25,505 --> 00:45:27,386
I want to talk to you in person.

664
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:29,646
Can you meet me in the evening?

665
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,870
Nephew, she is crazy about you?

666
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:51,378
Did you meet Julie?

667
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,855
Mani, are you mad?
- Brother...

668
00:46:09,248 --> 00:46:11,413
Hey!

669
00:46:12,015 --> 00:46:14,074
What happened?

670
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:17,161
I thought you were coming to hit me.

671
00:46:18,114 --> 00:46:22,167
I was asleep.
- My Kanchan.

672
00:46:22,287 --> 00:46:25,199
Let that old woman leave,
I will come later.

673
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:26,827
He's lamenting in sleep.

674
00:46:26,947 --> 00:46:29,136
Are you still angry?

675
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:32,985
It's because of Julie
I lose my cool.

676
00:46:33,538 --> 00:46:36,770
I don't have anyone
other than you in the world.

677
00:47:04,611 --> 00:47:06,614
The tiger is here!

678
00:47:06,734 --> 00:47:08,643
Where is the tiger?

679
00:47:08,723 --> 00:47:11,696
That was not tiger, but Maina!

680
00:47:11,816 --> 00:47:14,757
Uncle, you go back to sleep.
There's still time. Sleep.

681
00:47:15,351 --> 00:47:16,551
Maina.

682
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,670
Maina.

683
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:21,851
Maina.

684
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:25,005
Don't touch me. Go to your Julie.
- Why?

685
00:47:26,652 --> 00:47:28,114
What happened?
Why are you crying?

686
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:31,801
My doll broke.

687
00:47:32,165 --> 00:47:34,257
You shouldn't cry for
such petty matter.

688
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,267
Come, Nephew. - Uncle, we've been
booked for two weeks now.

689
00:48:35,387 --> 00:48:36,734
You must also come.

690
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:39,508
We have to go far.
- We'll go.

691
00:48:39,628 --> 00:48:41,692
Greetings.
- How are you?

692
00:48:42,082 --> 00:48:44,029
The stuff will reach in 2 days.

693
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,676
Stuff?
- Yes, our medicine.

694
00:48:46,796 --> 00:48:49,347
Marijuana for preparing medicine.

695
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,298
Yes.

696
00:48:50,378 --> 00:48:53,031
Only you can help
to take it out of the forest.

697
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:56,288
I am going out for two weeks.

698
00:48:56,408 --> 00:48:58,652
We won't be able to
leave from here without you.

699
00:48:58,732 --> 00:49:01,636
It'll be very helpful for Mani.

700
00:49:01,716 --> 00:49:03,505
Please don't go.
- Maheshwar,

701
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:05,978
I went home looking for you.

702
00:49:06,098 --> 00:49:07,466
There is an issue!

703
00:49:07,586 --> 00:49:11,773
Forest officials recovered dead
tiger in Dhanakpur.

704
00:49:11,893 --> 00:49:13,486
When investigated,
they found out that

705
00:49:13,566 --> 00:49:14,935
humans have killed it.

706
00:49:15,015 --> 00:49:16,318
That is not the issue now.

707
00:49:16,398 --> 00:49:18,343
New ranger has taken up charge

708
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:21,703
for the continuance enquiry.

709
00:49:22,678 --> 00:49:24,094
Our RK.

710
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,743
He says he's sure that
you'd have killed the tiger.

711
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:33,469
Mahesh, he will arrest you.
Go and hide in the forest.

712
00:49:33,953 --> 00:49:35,812
Ranger must have
not forgotten the past.

713
00:49:35,892 --> 00:49:38,396
If he takes this as a chance,
then things will go haywire. Go.

714
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,353
Who will do our work?

715
00:49:40,433 --> 00:49:41,596
Are you mad?

716
00:49:41,676 --> 00:49:43,650
Why are you still standing here?
Leave.

717
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:44,745
Come on.

718
00:49:45,221 --> 00:49:46,356
Come, I say.

719
00:49:51,107 --> 00:49:53,550
If Mahesh gets into the forest,

720
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,015
even God can't find him out.
- Who is RK?

721
00:49:56,945 --> 00:49:58,739
What problem does
Mahesh have from him?

722
00:49:59,345 --> 00:50:02,047
That happened 7-8 years ago.

723
00:50:02,637 --> 00:50:05,308
During that time, a tiger entered
in the neighboring village

724
00:50:05,891 --> 00:50:09,113
and it had taken away
4-5 people and 2-3 children.

725
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:12,205
Mahesh entered the forest
to kill the tiger.

726
00:50:12,532 --> 00:50:15,138
Even the government had passed
orders to kill the tiger.

727
00:50:15,218 --> 00:50:17,581
At that time, the ranger came there.

728
00:50:23,428 --> 00:50:25,839
If someone tastes

729
00:50:26,228 --> 00:50:28,909
wild meat and forest women,

730
00:50:29,428 --> 00:50:32,120
then he will never leave the forest.

731
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,245
Sir, please forget that Maina.

732
00:50:35,482 --> 00:50:37,893
She is an orphan poor girl.

733
00:50:40,834 --> 00:50:42,497
She is not your daughter, is she?

734
00:50:42,617 --> 00:50:44,736
Even otherwise, it wouldn't
have made any difference.

735
00:50:44,816 --> 00:50:48,120
I don't compromise in such things.

736
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:51,309
She has been slipping away
from my hands since a year.

737
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:54,055
Today, I will fulfill my desire.

738
00:50:55,914 --> 00:50:57,924
What happened? Where is Maina?

739
00:50:58,735 --> 00:51:00,584
We chased her for a long distance.

740
00:51:00,664 --> 00:51:02,570
I don't know where she disappeared.

741
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:07,074
Where did she go?
- She would've gone inside the forest.

742
00:51:07,154 --> 00:51:09,128
We tried to find her,
but couldn't get her.

743
00:51:37,324 --> 00:51:38,362
Stop!

744
00:51:41,032 --> 00:51:42,302
Where are you running?

745
00:52:31,926 --> 00:52:33,094
Why did you jump in the water?

746
00:52:33,716 --> 00:52:36,462
I have something important to tell you.
- Here in the forest?

747
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:39,846
Even if you slap me here, nobody
will see. - What do you want to say?

748
00:52:40,602 --> 00:52:42,635
I wish to marry you.

749
00:52:42,981 --> 00:52:44,068
In this forest?

750
00:52:44,148 --> 00:52:46,003
No, not in this forest,

751
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,614
but in a temple.

752
00:52:47,808 --> 00:52:49,278
But I need your acceptance here.

753
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:50,976
Don't you have any other business?

754
00:52:51,056 --> 00:52:52,889
First, get me out of this place,
I'll think about it later.

755
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,847
You give your consent for marriage.

756
00:52:54,927 --> 00:52:57,215
That will not happen.
- We'll stay here then.

757
00:52:57,295 --> 00:52:59,636
Until you don't agree,
we won't leave the forest.

758
00:53:03,344 --> 00:53:05,476
Oh, God, I've heard

759
00:53:05,556 --> 00:53:09,653
that there are big crocodiles
in the river. What if they eat us up?

760
00:53:09,733 --> 00:53:12,886
It's better to get eaten up by a
crocodile rather marrying you?

761
00:53:12,966 --> 00:53:14,356
No.

762
00:53:14,436 --> 00:53:16,868
Stop talking and get me out from here.

763
00:53:17,365 --> 00:53:19,570
Give me your consent for marriage.

764
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,943
You'll find many girls,
then why are you after me?

765
00:53:23,023 --> 00:53:25,170
What?
- Don't pretend.

766
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,393
All the girls in the village
chant your name.

767
00:53:27,473 --> 00:53:30,484
What? I didn't get you.
- Really?

768
00:53:30,668 --> 00:53:34,733
If you have to marry me, you won't
ogle at any girl or I'll kill you.

769
00:53:34,813 --> 00:53:36,452
Will you marry me?

770
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:50,912
Shall I carry you?
It's too slippery here.

771
00:53:50,992 --> 00:53:54,977
What if you fall? - I'm walking on
these rocks since childhood.

772
00:53:55,204 --> 00:53:56,426
Fine, go.

773
00:54:03,862 --> 00:54:07,213
Sir, she is my would be wife, Maina.

774
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:09,029
I'm going to marry her.

775
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:12,413
If you dare to

776
00:54:13,137 --> 00:54:14,716
ogle at her again,

777
00:54:15,137 --> 00:54:16,218
I won't spare you.

778
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:19,870
I'll pierce your chest
with my spear.

779
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:33,289
Ranger got transferred after few days.

780
00:54:34,057 --> 00:54:35,992
We thought all problems had gone.

781
00:54:37,365 --> 00:54:39,657
Now, he is back again...

782
00:55:05,865 --> 00:55:09,260
Maina... Wild Maina!

783
00:55:15,457 --> 00:55:17,770
Where is your husband?

784
00:55:18,257 --> 00:55:19,630
I don't know.

785
00:55:20,354 --> 00:55:22,895
He is not here.
If you say so,

786
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:25,230
will I believe you?

787
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,219
Do you think I am a fool?

788
00:55:27,749 --> 00:55:33,442
It's not possible that a wife doesn't
know about husband's whereabouts.

789
00:55:33,745 --> 00:55:35,875
Sir, please leave her.
- Uncle.

790
00:55:35,955 --> 00:55:37,723
Ask me what you want to know.

791
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,907
I will ask her.

792
00:55:42,658 --> 00:55:43,934
You do your work.

793
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,566
Move away!

794
00:55:50,302 --> 00:55:51,285
Uncle.

795
00:56:03,737 --> 00:56:07,337
I want to interrogate you.
- Sir, let her go.

796
00:56:07,953 --> 00:56:09,510
Talk to me.

797
00:56:16,643 --> 00:56:18,416
Although a mother of one,

798
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:21,540
you still look young.

799
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:26,084
Mother!

800
00:56:26,164 --> 00:56:27,673
Sir, no.

801
00:56:29,046 --> 00:56:30,182
Sister-in-law!

802
00:56:32,203 --> 00:56:33,727
Where will you run to?

803
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:15,542
"He is a fighter."

804
00:57:15,622 --> 00:57:19,958
"Everyone knows it."

805
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:29,653
"He doesn't miss his aim.
He is a real fighter."

806
00:57:34,474 --> 00:57:35,588
Hey!

807
00:57:36,117 --> 00:57:39,688
Maheshwar is a tiger.
He does not hide!

808
00:57:39,768 --> 00:57:41,191
He just attacks!

809
00:59:02,348 --> 00:59:05,018
"He is a fighter."

810
00:59:05,098 --> 00:59:09,504
"Everyone knows it."

811
00:59:11,937 --> 00:59:18,982
"He doesn't miss his aim.
He is a real fighter."

812
00:59:44,671 --> 00:59:47,514
"He is a fighter."

813
00:59:47,594 --> 00:59:52,130
"Everyone knows it."

814
00:59:55,180 --> 01:00:02,131
"He doesn't miss his aim.
He is a real fighter."

815
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:33,117
This is the final warning for you.

816
01:00:33,366 --> 01:00:35,084
If you step into this side

817
01:00:35,776 --> 01:00:37,962
of the bridge,

818
01:00:38,042 --> 01:00:41,216
I will sever those legs.
Get away!

819
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:45,119
"He is a fighter."

820
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:49,681
"Everyone knows it."

821
01:00:51,195 --> 01:00:56,168
Only the head of the village can treat
those thrashed by Maheshwar.

822
01:00:56,449 --> 01:00:58,665
Or he will never walk again.

823
01:00:58,745 --> 01:00:59,894
Shut up.

824
01:00:59,974 --> 01:01:03,375
You're lucky to be alive.

825
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:06,337
Maheshwar doesn't spare

826
01:01:06,417 --> 01:01:10,274
the one who lays

827
01:01:10,685 --> 01:01:15,334
his hands on his wife alive.

828
01:01:15,414 --> 01:01:18,047
Will you shut up?
My wife is inside, she will hear you.

829
01:01:18,127 --> 01:01:19,911
Oh, my God. Dear.

830
01:01:19,991 --> 01:01:21,446
What happened, Vandana?

831
01:01:21,662 --> 01:01:23,392
Someone is peeping into the bathroom.

832
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:25,122
That must be Sashi.

833
01:01:25,202 --> 01:01:26,787
Don't watch! Go and catch him!

834
01:01:26,867 --> 01:01:28,062
Don't catch me, sir.

835
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,500
I couldn't see anything,

836
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:32,212
she started screaming unnecessarily.
- Stop!

837
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:33,271
Stop!

838
01:01:33,351 --> 01:01:35,790
Are you blind?
- I was here to clean their bathroom.

839
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:37,195
I slipped,
I am going to take a shower.

840
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,893
Hey...
- Catch him!

841
01:01:38,973 --> 01:01:40,352
Hey, stop!

842
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,694
I am I.P. Zechariah ACP.

843
01:01:44,953 --> 01:01:48,175
I got the information.
Thought I'd meet you in the morning.

844
01:01:48,255 --> 01:01:51,787
I heard you had an accident,
hence I am here in person.

845
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,149
It doesn't look like a minor accident.

846
01:01:55,517 --> 01:01:57,679
It's an attack of a tiger.

847
01:01:58,101 --> 01:02:00,274
Don't worry. I know everything.

848
01:02:01,353 --> 01:02:03,656
I also here to hunt a tiger.

849
01:02:03,969 --> 01:02:06,391
And you will help me hunt it.

850
01:02:10,196 --> 01:02:12,380
What is your name?
- Diwakar Sharma.

851
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:15,164
Then, you leave and take him along.

852
01:02:15,244 --> 01:02:17,737
I got something personal
to discuss with Ranger.

853
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,380
Okay?

854
01:02:19,575 --> 01:02:20,894
Don't take this lightly, Maheshwar.

855
01:02:20,974 --> 01:02:21,970
Tell me something.

856
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:25,044
Has any police officer came here
looking for you?

857
01:02:25,124 --> 01:02:28,050
You will land in trouble.
- But what wrong did Maheshwar do?

858
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:30,082
You've no idea
how serious the issue is.

859
01:02:30,162 --> 01:02:31,704
It's a big crime to kill a tiger.

860
01:02:31,784 --> 01:02:32,969
It is a non-bailable case.

861
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,035
Any evidences against me
for killing the tiger?

862
01:02:35,115 --> 01:02:36,614
Maheshwar, don't be so innocent.

863
01:02:36,694 --> 01:02:38,192
It's RK who is writing the FIR.

864
01:02:38,272 --> 01:02:41,349
He doesn't need evidence nor witness.

865
01:02:41,429 --> 01:02:43,976
He will produce the FIR in the court

866
01:02:44,056 --> 01:02:45,621
and become the self-witness.

867
01:02:45,701 --> 01:02:47,253
This will be sufficient for the court.

868
01:02:47,437 --> 01:02:49,361
You are in deep trouble now.

869
01:02:49,988 --> 01:02:51,869
Diwakar sir is right, Mahesh.

870
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:53,448
It's better to move away from here.

871
01:02:53,528 --> 01:02:54,573
What for?

872
01:02:54,984 --> 01:02:58,162
I never kill the tiger
after it enters the forest.

873
01:02:58,242 --> 01:02:59,438
Everyone knows that.

874
01:02:59,518 --> 01:03:03,330
I have killed the tigers
that troubled the villagers.

875
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,238
They had become man-eaters.

876
01:03:05,487 --> 01:03:07,508
No police case
if tiger kills the people,

877
01:03:07,588 --> 01:03:09,659
but if I kill the tiger,
then it is a case?

878
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:11,714
I can even be hanged to death?

879
01:03:11,794 --> 01:03:14,611
Why should my family and I
move to the city fearing like ranger?

880
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:16,008
Never.

881
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:22,961
Quick. Place them properly.
Also cover them well.

882
01:03:23,502 --> 01:03:25,005
Why are you loading the stuff?
- What do you mean?

883
01:03:25,221 --> 01:03:26,496
Brother is not totally unaware of it.

884
01:03:26,576 --> 01:03:28,767
We were unaware of it too.

885
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:31,522
We didn't find time to inform.
- And your brother promised to help us.

886
01:03:31,602 --> 01:03:34,138
I thought it'll be done.
- I agree, brother said he will help,

887
01:03:34,218 --> 01:03:35,878
but now, the situation is different.

888
01:03:36,106 --> 01:03:39,533
Brother won't go anywhere
leaving his family.

889
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:41,003
I will talk to him.

890
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:43,516
He will arrange you another vehicle.

891
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,738
Okay. But let the stuff
remain in this vehicle.

892
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,322
It's also your responsibility.

893
01:03:49,402 --> 01:03:51,084
We're doing this for you.

894
01:03:51,164 --> 01:03:52,338
Don't forget that.

895
01:03:56,511 --> 01:03:58,338
What is it?
- Come with me.

896
01:03:59,473 --> 01:04:02,306
Tell me.
- Rambo's aide Gopi has been arrested.

897
01:04:02,893 --> 01:04:06,320
Rambo escaped,
but Gopi was aware of our stuff.

898
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,250
What shall we do now?
- Move the stuff from this area quickly.

899
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:12,018
Only Maheshwar can do it.

900
01:04:12,374 --> 01:04:14,883
Forest officials and policemen
will reach here anytime.

901
01:04:14,963 --> 01:04:16,743
I'm also going to escape
into the jungle.

902
01:04:16,823 --> 01:04:18,765
I'd to pass on the information,
do something.

903
01:04:18,845 --> 01:04:23,153
How's it possible? Mani said his brother
won't go anywhere leaving his family.

904
01:04:23,273 --> 01:04:24,488
I've no idea about that.

905
01:04:24,568 --> 01:04:28,499
But now, only Maheshwar
will be able to help you.

906
01:04:30,682 --> 01:04:32,228
We enquired well.

907
01:04:32,308 --> 01:04:34,585
Ranger got admitted in the hospital.

908
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:37,924
Attempt to murder case
has been filed against you.

909
01:04:38,152 --> 01:04:40,584
And another case too,
for killing the tiger.

910
01:04:40,887 --> 01:04:43,070
We can get out of here,

911
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:47,076
but we don't want to go
leaving you in this state.

912
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:48,698
We can't do that.

913
01:04:49,282 --> 01:04:53,357
If the police arrests you,
you can never be bailed out.

914
01:04:54,373 --> 01:04:57,136
You and your family come with us.

915
01:04:57,536 --> 01:04:59,493
Once you get out of this place,

916
01:04:59,753 --> 01:05:01,526
you'll be safe from the police.

917
01:05:01,861 --> 01:05:03,201
You just need to get out of here.

918
01:05:03,281 --> 01:05:05,872
Nobody would be able to
lay hands on you, it's a promise.

919
01:05:05,952 --> 01:05:09,418
Think about it. If police arrests you,

920
01:05:09,677 --> 01:05:10,862
we will be ruined.

921
01:05:10,942 --> 01:05:13,143
Mahesh, there's no much time,
get going.

922
01:05:13,223 --> 01:05:14,542
I will handle things here.

923
01:05:14,622 --> 01:05:17,433
Take your family and leave at once.

924
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:18,957
Sir, quick.

925
01:05:19,037 --> 01:05:21,833
Police will reach here any moment.
- It's impossible.

926
01:05:21,913 --> 01:05:24,471
I won't let anyone cross the bridge.

927
01:05:24,698 --> 01:05:27,292
Mahesh, leave at once.

928
01:05:27,372 --> 01:05:29,014
Come on, leave.

929
01:05:32,516 --> 01:05:35,803
I have never left my place

930
01:05:36,581 --> 01:05:40,885
fearing the police or anybody.

931
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:46,874
But if you people feel this is right,

932
01:05:50,775 --> 01:05:51,954
I will go.

933
01:06:01,281 --> 01:06:02,513
Come fast.

934
01:06:18,512 --> 01:06:20,735
Come. Let's go.
- Let's go.

935
01:06:23,978 --> 01:06:25,081
Let's go.

936
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,508
Balram, save me.

937
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:32,050
What happened?
- Police is coming to nab me.

938
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:36,364
What for? - They are offended,
because I saw the ranger's wife bathe.

939
01:06:40,018 --> 01:06:41,112
Come on.

940
01:06:41,663 --> 01:06:43,739
Get to Mahesh's lorry fast.

941
01:06:49,771 --> 01:06:51,025
Mahesh...

942
01:06:57,462 --> 01:06:58,749
I'm also coming.
- Quick.

943
01:06:59,603 --> 01:07:01,397
You're quite punctual.

944
01:07:01,614 --> 01:07:02,652
Stop.

945
01:07:08,176 --> 01:07:09,765
It's them, right?
- Yes, sir.

946
01:07:09,845 --> 01:07:11,841
They are trying to escape
through the jungle.

947
01:07:11,921 --> 01:07:14,491
I know the other route,
if we take that, we can nab them.

948
01:07:14,571 --> 01:07:16,762
Then, come on. Don't waste the time.
Hurry up. - Yes, sir.

949
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,484
There's the lorry.
- Yes, sir.

950
01:07:37,214 --> 01:07:38,684
Faster...

951
01:07:42,749 --> 01:07:44,090
Maheshwar...

952
01:07:44,516 --> 01:07:47,629
Speed up, don't let them get to us.

953
01:07:49,672 --> 01:07:51,175
Speed up.
- Yes, sir.

954
01:08:18,598 --> 01:08:21,376
They are after us
and there's marijuana in the lorry.

955
01:08:21,456 --> 01:08:23,225
We must cross this forest, somehow.

956
01:08:23,305 --> 01:08:26,014
There will be no danger,
we will reach my father's territory.

957
01:08:26,094 --> 01:08:27,796
No one can dare touch you there.

958
01:08:27,876 --> 01:08:29,320
It's my promise to you.

959
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:39,538
Be careful. Stop.

960
01:08:49,025 --> 01:08:51,890
Follow them. Come on. Hurry up.
- Quick.

961
01:08:57,579 --> 01:09:01,038
Stop. Take reverse.

962
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:05,730
Take reverse. Quick.

963
01:09:05,957 --> 01:09:08,271
Take reverse, quick.
- Quick.

964
01:09:30,428 --> 01:09:33,804
Since then, Maheshwar and
his family has been staying

965
01:09:33,924 --> 01:09:37,574
in the protection of
Dada Giriraj in Mangalpur.

966
01:09:37,654 --> 01:09:40,651
And Dada Giriraj told Maheshwar

967
01:09:40,731 --> 01:09:43,256
that he would handle all his cases.

968
01:09:43,336 --> 01:09:46,099
Since it's a promise,
he must've kept up his word.

969
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:47,645
You may go now.

970
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:50,034
We will try to help you.
- Okay.

971
01:09:52,274 --> 01:09:55,030
Listen. I forgot to ask.

972
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:57,387
What is your name?

973
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:09,974
Dada...

974
01:10:10,493 --> 01:10:12,903
Dada Giriraj.

975
01:10:42,761 --> 01:10:44,426
We've come so far

976
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,183
and not a single policeman
dared to chase us.

977
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:51,291
I couldn't have thought of
the idea by sir even in my dream.

978
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:52,956
You're amazing, sir.

979
01:10:53,036 --> 01:10:55,448
You're intelligent too.

980
01:10:56,951 --> 01:11:00,464
I hope Sashi is safe
at the back of the lorry.

981
01:11:01,243 --> 01:11:04,010
It's a sunny day,
at least get me cold drink.

982
01:11:10,507 --> 01:11:12,279
This is too much.
- Actually...

983
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:15,220
Manager, you should've
told him in detail.

984
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:19,634
You've borrowed money from me,
so you must repay it.

985
01:11:19,714 --> 01:11:23,438
I waited because you were
in financial crunch.

986
01:11:23,558 --> 01:11:27,877
But now, you have got money
and the entire city is aware of it.

987
01:11:28,274 --> 01:11:33,249
If Mr. Kader has asked
for his money back, what's wrong in it?

988
01:11:33,369 --> 01:11:39,080
Mr. Jumman, you broke the partnership
and you also want back the money.

989
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,369
The business has certain principles.

990
01:11:41,607 --> 01:11:42,948
Dada will repay the money

991
01:11:43,028 --> 01:11:45,607
only when he wants.

992
01:11:45,687 --> 01:11:46,769
You need to wait.

993
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:48,380
In that case,

994
01:11:48,661 --> 01:11:50,564
then let me tell you something.

995
01:11:50,644 --> 01:11:53,222
You'll pay a huge price
if you betray Mr. Kader.

996
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:57,536
You know the fate of those
who betray him.

997
01:12:04,689 --> 01:12:07,530
I hate those who talk loudly.

998
01:12:07,757 --> 01:12:11,865
I was the king and
will be one forever.

999
01:12:11,945 --> 01:12:16,905
Tell Kader to recover the money from me
if he has the guts.

1000
01:12:20,992 --> 01:12:23,175
Mr. Jumman, get going.

1001
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,822
Please come.

1002
01:12:37,902 --> 01:12:40,332
Daddy, this is Maheshwar.

1003
01:12:41,325 --> 01:12:42,817
Where's the stuff?
- It's in the lorry.

1004
01:12:47,174 --> 01:12:49,109
He has some problems in his hometown.

1005
01:12:49,336 --> 01:12:51,779
Hence he moved here with his family.

1006
01:12:54,428 --> 01:12:55,509
Dad...

1007
01:12:58,283 --> 01:12:59,418
Please don't mind.

1008
01:12:59,498 --> 01:13:00,932
That's daddy's nature.

1009
01:13:01,267 --> 01:13:04,780
Manager, they will stay in the outhouse,
please do the needful.

1010
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:06,672
Did you hear that?

1011
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,471
Listen, unlock the house
and do the needful.

1012
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,985
This is your new house,
you will be staying here.

1013
01:13:18,209 --> 01:13:19,258
This?
- Yes.

1014
01:13:19,338 --> 01:13:22,360
This house?
No, I don't want this.

1015
01:13:22,912 --> 01:13:25,117
A small room will do.

1016
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:27,009
Come on, sir.

1017
01:13:27,089 --> 01:13:29,152
As you've come from a small place,
you feel so.

1018
01:13:29,232 --> 01:13:30,676
You'll get used to it soon.

1019
01:13:30,756 --> 01:13:33,217
Untie me.

1020
01:13:34,136 --> 01:13:38,179
Are you still alive?
- A little bit of delay, I would've died.

1021
01:13:39,204 --> 01:13:41,172
Come on, get down.

1022
01:13:43,431 --> 01:13:44,718
This is really a deceit.

1023
01:13:44,798 --> 01:13:46,407
It's your punishment.
- But why?

1024
01:13:46,527 --> 01:13:49,248
This is what I do to those who get
on my lorry without my permission.

1025
01:13:49,328 --> 01:13:50,389
I need to pee. Where is the toilet?

1026
01:13:50,469 --> 01:13:52,123
What can I do?
- Where can I pee?

1027
01:13:52,203 --> 01:13:53,096
Inside the house.

1028
01:13:53,176 --> 01:13:55,456
Inside the house?
- There's toilet inside the house.

1029
01:13:55,576 --> 01:13:58,159
I'm used to pee only in the forest.
- Hey...

1030
01:13:58,279 --> 01:14:00,487
In the city,
rain also pours inside the houses.

1031
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:01,604
Must be the shower.

1032
01:14:01,684 --> 01:14:03,489
I don't know.
- People in the city are strange.

1033
01:14:04,127 --> 01:14:07,792
Forget that.
Make a drink for me quickly.

1034
01:14:07,872 --> 01:14:10,851
Mani, already your brother
has begun to jabber.

1035
01:14:10,931 --> 01:14:12,413
Don't give him anymore.
- You're right.

1036
01:14:12,726 --> 01:14:14,197
Your wife is absolutely right.

1037
01:14:14,277 --> 01:14:16,424
Too much alcohol
is not good for health.

1038
01:14:16,802 --> 01:14:18,435
Give me some.
- Don't touch.

1039
01:14:18,515 --> 01:14:19,872
Or else I will chop your hands.

1040
01:14:20,359 --> 01:14:22,797
Mani, I don't know how to cook in gas.

1041
01:14:22,877 --> 01:14:24,873
Arrange some firewood outside,
I want cook food.

1042
01:14:24,953 --> 01:14:27,551
There's no firewood here,
I shall light the stove for you.

1043
01:14:27,878 --> 01:14:30,062
That's alright.
- Father...

1044
01:14:31,068 --> 01:14:33,079
Come here.

1045
01:14:33,382 --> 01:14:35,706
What's it?
- I will tell you, come here.

1046
01:14:35,786 --> 01:14:36,960
Your daughter is calling you, go.

1047
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:43,500
I'll kill you.
- I will only smell it.

1048
01:14:46,318 --> 01:14:49,502
I don't mind getting thrashed by him.

1049
01:14:54,342 --> 01:14:55,391
What is it, Chakki?

1050
01:14:55,471 --> 01:14:59,520
Dad look, the mattress is so soft.

1051
01:15:00,893 --> 01:15:02,223
Wow!

1052
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,964
Maina...
- Mom...

1053
01:15:09,277 --> 01:15:10,920
Maina...
- Mom...

1054
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,510
I guess you're too drunk.

1055
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,578
Why are you screaming?
- Come on.

1056
01:15:14,658 --> 01:15:16,643
Come to me.

1057
01:15:16,723 --> 01:15:18,448
You will never reform.
- Hey...

1058
01:15:18,528 --> 01:15:19,724
Let go.
- Come.

1059
01:15:19,804 --> 01:15:21,432
Get away.

1060
01:15:21,512 --> 01:15:22,783
I didn't do anything.
- Come.

1061
01:15:22,863 --> 01:15:24,998
I didn't do anything.
- Come. Leave her.

1062
01:15:25,078 --> 01:15:26,804
Let go.
- Why are you getting angry?

1063
01:15:26,884 --> 01:15:28,858
Go away.
- Dad...

1064
01:15:28,938 --> 01:15:31,009
Come fast.
- Excuse me.

1065
01:15:31,647 --> 01:15:33,388
Even I want to sleep.

1066
01:15:33,734 --> 01:15:36,019
What?
- I'm tired, I want to sleep.

1067
01:15:36,099 --> 01:15:38,353
You're going to sleep beside
your wife on mat. - What did you say?

1068
01:15:38,473 --> 01:15:41,111
Believe me, even my ancestors

1069
01:15:41,191 --> 01:15:43,532
wouldn't have slept
on such soft mattress.

1070
01:15:43,652 --> 01:15:47,245
Their souls will rest in peace
if I sleep on it once

1071
01:15:47,365 --> 01:15:49,570
and my upcoming generations
will be blessed.

1072
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:51,278
I will slap you.

1073
01:15:51,358 --> 01:15:52,737
I will sleep here, go away from here.

1074
01:15:52,817 --> 01:15:54,759
My ancestors will bless you.
- Out!

1075
01:15:56,321 --> 01:15:58,457
What are you doing?
- Your brother is so mean.

1076
01:15:58,537 --> 01:16:01,898
Drive him away.
I won't spare you if you came back.

1077
01:16:02,018 --> 01:16:03,867
Brother...
- Yes.

1078
01:16:03,947 --> 01:16:07,101
If you drive him away,
he will expose us before the police.

1079
01:16:07,181 --> 01:16:08,993
Oh! I didn't realize that.

1080
01:16:09,073 --> 01:16:11,423
Don't go. Wait. You...

1081
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:14,949
Allow me to stay until morning,
I'll go away in a couple of days.

1082
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:16,993
Alright, I will go away
the day after tomorrow.

1083
01:16:17,956 --> 01:16:19,880
Will you behave well?
- I'm from an educated family.

1084
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,404
In that case, you can stay here.

1085
01:16:21,524 --> 01:16:24,183
But if you don't behave well,
I won't spare you.

1086
01:16:24,263 --> 01:16:25,318
I will...

1087
01:16:26,216 --> 01:16:30,133
Hereafter, I will behave well.
I'm not a peeping tom anymore,

1088
01:16:30,213 --> 01:16:33,278
I won't pee or take a shower...

1089
01:16:33,398 --> 01:16:34,532
Mr. Maheshwar...
- What?

1090
01:16:34,652 --> 01:16:36,186
I need to talk to you.

1091
01:16:36,306 --> 01:16:37,236
What is it?

1092
01:16:37,316 --> 01:16:40,535
The marijuana has to be moved
to the pharmacy tonight.

1093
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:42,264
Where is the pharmacy?

1094
01:16:42,344 --> 01:16:44,610
It's about 3-4 drive from here.

1095
01:16:45,345 --> 01:16:46,372
Let's start immediately.

1096
01:16:47,205 --> 01:16:49,310
I am sorry,
I won't be able to drive the lorry.

1097
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:51,429
But why?
- I am too drunk.

1098
01:16:52,034 --> 01:16:54,586
My lorry gets angry
if I drive it in a drunken state.

1099
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:56,045
I have experienced it.

1100
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,591
Let's start in the morning.

1101
01:16:57,671 --> 01:17:00,362
Sir, we will have to do it tonight,

1102
01:17:00,442 --> 01:17:03,033
there will be checking in the morning.
- Then, how's it possible?

1103
01:17:04,514 --> 01:17:06,395
Then, give me the keys,

1104
01:17:06,643 --> 01:17:08,438
I will drive the lorry.
- No.

1105
01:17:09,165 --> 01:17:11,587
No, that's not possible.

1106
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:13,684
Sir, I will bring
the lorry back by morning.

1107
01:17:14,095 --> 01:17:15,598
There's no other option.

1108
01:17:15,868 --> 01:17:17,760
Please, sir.

1109
01:17:18,232 --> 01:17:19,724
Please, sir.

1110
01:17:20,113 --> 01:17:24,935
Be careful about my truck.

1111
01:17:25,194 --> 01:17:27,821
The lorry is dear to me.

1112
01:17:28,081 --> 01:17:29,881
Sure.
- Be careful.

1113
01:17:30,302 --> 01:17:31,697
Thanks.
- Listen...

1114
01:17:31,777 --> 01:17:33,427
Nothing will happen, don't worry.

1115
01:17:39,635 --> 01:17:42,770
He is taking my lorry away,
I feel pained.

1116
01:17:42,997 --> 01:17:45,668
Let's drink more.

1117
01:17:46,587 --> 01:17:48,803
I drank the remaining liquor.

1118
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:50,996
What are you saying?

1119
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:55,871
"Clean India. Good India."

1120
01:17:55,951 --> 01:18:00,207
"Every leaf is flying."

1121
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:01,758
Don't you take a shower in the morning?

1122
01:18:01,838 --> 01:18:03,358
I take a shower before I come to work.

1123
01:18:03,438 --> 01:18:06,262
Call me when you take a shower,
I will help you.

1124
01:18:06,342 --> 01:18:09,704
I will beat you with the broomstick.
- She seems to be dangerous.

1125
01:18:09,784 --> 01:18:12,730
Is your name Jaanu?
- No, Sumati.

1126
01:18:12,925 --> 01:18:13,736
What is it to you?

1127
01:18:13,816 --> 01:18:15,898
Actually, the name Jaanu
suits you well.

1128
01:18:15,978 --> 01:18:18,071
I will beat you with broomstick.

1129
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:19,347
Hey...

1130
01:18:20,514 --> 01:18:22,276
What's going on?
- It's social service.

1131
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,392
I offered her help,

1132
01:18:24,472 --> 01:18:27,354
she said she'll lose her job
and you know my nature.

1133
01:18:27,635 --> 01:18:30,748
You know how much I respect women.

1134
01:18:30,828 --> 01:18:32,096
Let me help her.

1135
01:18:32,216 --> 01:18:33,389
Why hasn't he brought
my lorry back as yet?

1136
01:18:33,469 --> 01:18:34,449
Is it?

1137
01:18:34,529 --> 01:18:37,530
Then, it would've met in an accident
or fallen into valley for sure.

1138
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:39,692
Shut up. I will cut off your tongue.

1139
01:18:40,308 --> 01:18:42,395
Come on, I was just joking.

1140
01:18:42,736 --> 01:18:44,289
Clean India...
- Sashi...

1141
01:18:44,369 --> 01:18:45,255
I am coming.

1142
01:18:48,001 --> 01:18:49,861
It has not arrived yet.
- What?

1143
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,850
My lorry is not back yet.

1144
01:18:53,136 --> 01:18:55,461
Don't worry, it will come back.

1145
01:18:55,796 --> 01:18:58,607
23...
- He's having a tough time getting up.

1146
01:18:58,687 --> 01:19:01,126
He has so many men around,
but no one is helping him.

1147
01:19:01,206 --> 01:19:02,207
Shall we help him?

1148
01:19:02,287 --> 01:19:04,432
He is exercising.
- Good manners.

1149
01:19:04,512 --> 01:19:06,107
27... Come on.

1150
01:19:07,632 --> 01:19:10,356
How are you, Maheshwar?
How about competing with me?

1151
01:19:10,561 --> 01:19:12,107
Sir, you will be defeated.

1152
01:19:12,187 --> 01:19:14,691
No one can defeat him
in such challenges.

1153
01:19:14,771 --> 01:19:16,248
He is like a lion...
- Keep quiet.

1154
01:19:17,016 --> 01:19:19,211
I am be glad if you
assign me some work.

1155
01:19:19,291 --> 01:19:21,459
I am not used to being idle.
- He's right.

1156
01:19:21,848 --> 01:19:23,557
But I love to remain idle.

1157
01:19:24,821 --> 01:19:26,575
Shall I wash the cars?

1158
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:28,359
Sir, whatever you say...
- Okay.

1159
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:29,440
Keep quiet.

1160
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,662
Okay, no problem.

1161
01:19:30,742 --> 01:19:34,218
I will show you how to wash them.
- Go fetch water.

1162
01:19:43,353 --> 01:19:44,704
Hey...

1163
01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:46,809
What happened?

1164
01:19:47,284 --> 01:19:49,382
Are you okay?
- I am fine.

1165
01:19:49,814 --> 01:19:51,965
Dada, we have a situation.

1166
01:19:52,045 --> 01:19:55,122
Men arrived in jeeps
and seized the lorry.

1167
01:19:55,202 --> 01:19:57,701
They took away the lorry and Shiva too.

1168
01:19:58,306 --> 01:19:59,755
I don't know who they are.

1169
01:20:10,019 --> 01:20:11,597
It was Kader's man,

1170
01:20:12,235 --> 01:20:14,062
he demands 10 crores.

1171
01:20:14,484 --> 01:20:17,824
Both, the lorry and Shiva
are in his custody.

1172
01:20:17,904 --> 01:20:19,340
Let's not worsen the matter.

1173
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,643
I suggest you give him the money.

1174
01:20:21,946 --> 01:20:23,027
Don't take risk.

1175
01:20:28,116 --> 01:20:29,521
What's wrong?

1176
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:31,716
It's an old issue,

1177
01:20:31,796 --> 01:20:34,083
but I guess it will be resolved.

1178
01:20:35,575 --> 01:20:38,873
Dada could've given a befitting reply.

1179
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:43,228
Seeing Dada calm,
don't think he will forgive Kader.

1180
01:20:43,308 --> 01:20:45,293
He has dealt will many such men.

1181
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:48,741
Dada has taught them a good lesson.

1182
01:20:49,033 --> 01:20:52,037
Take the money, go give it to him.

1183
01:20:52,253 --> 01:20:53,821
He has wronged.

1184
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:56,642
We will deal with him later.

1185
01:20:57,021 --> 01:21:01,599
Go, get my son released
from his custody.

1186
01:21:06,139 --> 01:21:07,437
What about my lorry?

1187
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:11,345
Don't worry,
you will get your lorry back.

1188
01:21:11,425 --> 01:21:13,854
Raju, let's go, quick.

1189
01:21:16,264 --> 01:21:17,983
Wait, I will come along.

1190
01:21:18,167 --> 01:21:22,201
I want my lorry.
- Come on. Get in.

1191
01:21:22,904 --> 01:21:24,309
Wait. Stop.

1192
01:21:25,206 --> 01:21:27,649
They took away all the vehicles.
Should I take a shower with this water?

1193
01:21:51,883 --> 01:21:53,814
What are you doing? What's wrong?

1194
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:13,903
Jumman, you said Dada
won't give me money.

1195
01:22:13,983 --> 01:22:17,782
No one can make away with my money.

1196
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:22,528
Manager, tell Dada Giriraj that

1197
01:22:22,608 --> 01:22:26,765
those who have messed with me
have lost their lives.

1198
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:29,522
Well, he knows that.

1199
01:22:29,602 --> 01:22:31,489
After all, we were old friends.

1200
01:22:33,003 --> 01:22:35,126
Jumman, take the money.
- Okay.

1201
01:22:37,915 --> 01:22:40,758
Basheer, bring him.

1202
01:22:40,838 --> 01:22:42,304
Bring him.

1203
01:22:46,688 --> 01:22:48,461
Untie him, let him go.

1204
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:52,028
Go on.

1205
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,255
We would've offered him tea,

1206
01:22:54,335 --> 01:22:56,695
but the goat didn't give milk.

1207
01:22:57,365 --> 01:23:00,197
There are no keys in the lorry.

1208
01:23:00,277 --> 01:23:04,652
You're right.
That's because they are in my pocket.

1209
01:23:07,397 --> 01:23:10,716
Handover the keys to me.
- No, I won't.

1210
01:23:12,629 --> 01:23:16,251
His father had kicked Jumman,

1211
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:18,178
I'm deeply pained about it.

1212
01:23:18,258 --> 01:23:20,805
So, I decided to
have the lorry as compensation.

1213
01:23:20,885 --> 01:23:22,243
What are you saying?

1214
01:23:22,557 --> 01:23:24,081
It's my lorry.

1215
01:23:24,481 --> 01:23:26,892
Kick me, I don't mind,

1216
01:23:26,972 --> 01:23:30,353
but give me the keys.
- Won't you leave without the lorry?

1217
01:23:30,433 --> 01:23:32,731
No, I won't. I want my lorry.

1218
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:42,004
How dare you?

1219
01:23:42,084 --> 01:23:43,237
Do you see them?

1220
01:23:43,317 --> 01:23:46,523
These both dogs are very ferocious.

1221
01:23:46,956 --> 01:23:49,664
They will run when I signal

1222
01:23:49,744 --> 01:23:52,681
and will tear you to pieces.

1223
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,951
If you have understood then get going.

1224
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:04,318
I won't go without my lorry.

1225
01:24:04,398 --> 01:24:07,475
Jumman, give the dogs a chance
to feed upon human flesh.

1226
01:24:40,476 --> 01:24:43,518
Basheer, get him.

1227
01:25:26,063 --> 01:25:28,809
"He is a fighter."

1228
01:25:28,889 --> 01:25:33,306
"He is a fighter.
Everyone knows it."

1229
01:25:35,627 --> 01:25:43,043
"He doesn't miss his aim.
He is a real fighter."

1230
01:28:10,294 --> 01:28:11,451
The keys.

1231
01:28:11,843 --> 01:28:14,275
Take them out from the pocket yourself.

1232
01:28:16,005 --> 01:28:18,145
Did you find them?

1233
01:28:20,351 --> 01:28:23,118
"He's a fighter."

1234
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:27,539
"Everyone knows he's a fighter."

1235
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:37,246
"He doesn't miss his aim.
He is a real fighter."

1236
01:28:46,629 --> 01:28:48,164
You're amazing, Maheshwar.

1237
01:28:49,667 --> 01:28:51,824
You have impressed me today.

1238
01:28:52,149 --> 01:28:54,376
You're like a tiger.

1239
01:28:54,819 --> 01:28:57,489
When Dada is impressed with someone,

1240
01:28:57,569 --> 01:29:00,458
that person will do good in life.

1241
01:29:00,538 --> 01:29:03,106
We need to wait and watch.

1242
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:06,825
By the way, does the bathrooms
in the mansion have ventilators?

1243
01:29:06,905 --> 01:29:08,198
What do you want?

1244
01:29:08,278 --> 01:29:09,755
Ask for anything.

1245
01:29:10,998 --> 01:29:13,228
Assume God is asking you what you want.

1246
01:29:13,308 --> 01:29:14,255
Go on, ask.

1247
01:29:14,335 --> 01:29:15,704
If I got a chance,

1248
01:29:15,784 --> 01:29:18,461
I would takeover
all the bathrooms in the city.

1249
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:20,277
I mean, I would turn them
into public toilets.

1250
01:29:21,255 --> 01:29:22,401
Go on, ask.

1251
01:29:22,844 --> 01:29:24,682
Can I for anything?
- Yes, go on.

1252
01:29:24,909 --> 01:29:25,979
Anything?
- Yes.

1253
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:28,066
Are you sure?

1254
01:29:28,411 --> 01:29:29,643
Go on.

1255
01:29:30,843 --> 01:29:33,081
Give my brother Mani a job.

1256
01:29:38,335 --> 01:29:39,460
What's wrong?

1257
01:29:55,168 --> 01:29:57,817
Tell him to join our pharmacy
from tomorrow.

1258
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:01,496
Really?
- Monthly salary will be Rs. 40,000.

1259
01:30:01,576 --> 01:30:02,750
I hope it's not less?

1260
01:30:03,788 --> 01:30:06,242
What are you saying? Not at all.

1261
01:30:08,663 --> 01:30:12,241
You're more than God to us.

1262
01:30:16,349 --> 01:30:19,268
Mani got a job,
monthly salary will be Rs. 40,000.

1263
01:30:19,809 --> 01:30:21,826
My dreams are becoming reality.

1264
01:30:21,906 --> 01:30:23,426
May God keep His mercy on us.

1265
01:30:23,506 --> 01:30:25,653
I don't know why,
but I feel something fishy.

1266
01:30:25,733 --> 01:30:28,982
Silly, I agree he's strange,
but he's good man.

1267
01:30:29,209 --> 01:30:30,507
Don't worry.

1268
01:30:31,403 --> 01:30:33,295
He has an amazing name,

1269
01:30:33,479 --> 01:30:35,252
Dada Giriraj.

1270
01:30:36,095 --> 01:30:38,495
How can someone name
himself as a leader?

1271
01:30:38,711 --> 01:30:40,884
He is very generous towards you.

1272
01:30:40,964 --> 01:30:43,424
I suggest you be careful.

1273
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,511
Don't talk rubbish. Go to sleep.

1274
01:30:45,591 --> 01:30:47,792
You spent your life in forest,
you won't understand.

1275
01:30:47,872 --> 01:30:50,678
As if you were born in city.

1276
01:30:50,758 --> 01:30:53,170
Don't talk to me. - You too.

1277
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:54,305
Get away.

1278
01:30:54,803 --> 01:30:55,711
Coward.

1279
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:57,657
You're a coward.

1280
01:31:00,381 --> 01:31:03,040
I got to know
the intentions of everyone.

1281
01:31:04,779 --> 01:31:06,293
Look at him,
he's sleeping peacefully.

1282
01:31:06,373 --> 01:31:08,650
I shouldn't have trusted this man.

1283
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:10,606
I am tired of him.

1284
01:31:10,898 --> 01:31:13,734
He brought me to the city
by manipulating me. Get up.

1285
01:31:13,814 --> 01:31:15,366
Oh, my God!
- I know you well.

1286
01:31:15,446 --> 01:31:16,707
What happened?

1287
01:31:17,096 --> 01:31:17,939
Oh, my God!

1288
01:31:18,019 --> 01:31:21,183
You must've had a tough time
bringing us here and

1289
01:31:21,263 --> 01:31:23,551
finding this house for us, isn't it?
- Yes.

1290
01:31:24,307 --> 01:31:26,037
No. What are you saying?

1291
01:31:26,117 --> 01:31:28,772
'What are you saying?'
It's even futile to talk to you.

1292
01:31:28,852 --> 01:31:31,443
What happened, Dad?
Why is mom yelling?

1293
01:31:31,648 --> 01:31:33,369
I don't know.

1294
01:31:33,449 --> 01:31:36,007
I guess she has lost his mind.

1295
01:31:36,087 --> 01:31:38,796
Come,  my child.
Let's find out what's wrong with her.

1296
01:31:38,876 --> 01:31:41,315
He manipulates me
with his talks all the time.

1297
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:43,908
Take it.
- What's wrong? Tell me.

1298
01:31:44,157 --> 01:31:45,573
Come.
- Tea for me as well.

1299
01:31:46,059 --> 01:31:47,292
You won't get tea.

1300
01:31:47,372 --> 01:31:49,465
What's wrong? Tell me.

1301
01:31:49,919 --> 01:31:52,967
I've been living in pain all my life.
You don't know of it.

1302
01:31:53,194 --> 01:31:54,480
You don't care.

1303
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,955
Be precise.
- I will tell you.

1304
01:31:57,150 --> 01:31:59,669
The problem lies at the neighborhood.

1305
01:31:59,853 --> 01:32:03,842
The light of the bathroom
at the neighborhood was on,

1306
01:32:04,111 --> 01:32:07,495
Seeing the lights turned on at midnight
I thought it is waste of electricity.

1307
01:32:07,575 --> 01:32:09,333
And you know my nature,
how mannered I am.

1308
01:32:09,413 --> 01:32:12,219
I peeped in to find out
who is wasting electricity,

1309
01:32:12,299 --> 01:32:14,587
I was surprised.
Do you know who was there? - Who?

1310
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:16,722
It's suspense.

1311
01:32:16,802 --> 01:32:17,738
Tell me.

1312
01:32:17,818 --> 01:32:20,127
You know that person since long time.
- What do you mean?

1313
01:32:20,398 --> 01:32:22,754
You know that person well,

1314
01:32:22,834 --> 01:32:25,165
you'll be so excited to see her.
- Who's that?

1315
01:32:25,406 --> 01:32:28,692
When I show you, you will kiss me.

1316
01:32:28,772 --> 01:32:30,195
Take my word. Come with me.

1317
01:32:30,562 --> 01:32:32,714
Come, Maina.
- Darn it.

1318
01:32:32,794 --> 01:32:35,973
You will also find out
why your wife is upset.

1319
01:32:36,053 --> 01:32:37,238
Look over there.

1320
01:32:39,778 --> 01:32:43,541
Ju...

1321
01:32:44,114 --> 01:32:46,211
Not Ju, it's Julie.

1322
01:32:52,148 --> 01:32:53,175
What?

1323
01:32:55,045 --> 01:32:56,559
Later.
- When?

1324
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:57,897
Later.

1325
01:33:00,168 --> 01:33:01,649
Oh, my God!

1326
01:33:01,729 --> 01:33:03,011
Why did you come here?

1327
01:33:03,091 --> 01:33:04,751
What were you telling her?
- I was just...

1328
01:33:05,108 --> 01:33:08,290
We came here, because she stays here.
- I had no idea about it.

1329
01:33:08,463 --> 01:33:10,646
You know nothing.

1330
01:33:10,726 --> 01:33:12,128
You have fooled me.

1331
01:33:12,208 --> 01:33:13,115
Hey...
- I will deal with you.

1332
01:33:13,235 --> 01:33:16,571
I won't let you in. - Was she unaware
about your affair with Julie?

1333
01:33:17,908 --> 01:33:19,519
You're very angry.

1334
01:33:19,599 --> 01:33:20,622
Why aren't you ready?

1335
01:33:20,702 --> 01:33:22,092
You got to go to work, go.

1336
01:33:22,172 --> 01:33:24,470
Why are you venting
your anger on me?

1337
01:33:24,676 --> 01:33:27,443
I am a victim. I am going.

1338
01:33:34,748 --> 01:33:36,629
Sir, Shiva is inside.

1339
01:33:36,867 --> 01:33:37,786
Come, sir.

1340
01:33:37,866 --> 01:33:40,745
I think you need to check.
Just check it once.

1341
01:33:40,825 --> 01:33:42,086
Yeah.
- Okay, sir.

1342
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:44,832
Okay? Carry on.

1343
01:33:45,469 --> 01:33:46,897
Welcome, manager.
- Hi.

1344
01:33:47,167 --> 01:33:50,217
Sir, he's Mr. Mani,
our new marketing manager.

1345
01:33:50,297 --> 01:33:52,011
And his brother Mr. Maheshwar.
- Hello.

1346
01:33:52,091 --> 01:33:54,671
And he's Dr. Subramaniam,
the scientist.

1347
01:33:55,492 --> 01:33:56,584
What's that?

1348
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:58,022
He's a scientist.

1349
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:02,933
Oh. He's a scientist.

1350
01:34:03,366 --> 01:34:04,641
He's a scientist.

1351
01:34:04,825 --> 01:34:08,879
I had heard about scientists,
I got a chance to meet one today.

1352
01:34:09,506 --> 01:34:12,304
He is the scientist who manufactures
medicine for cancer with marijuana...

1353
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:16,001
Talk softly.
None is aware of the secret formula.

1354
01:34:17,017 --> 01:34:18,509
Do scientists look like him?

1355
01:34:18,589 --> 01:34:20,249
He is quite intelligent.

1356
01:34:20,329 --> 01:34:21,931
That's why his hair has turned grey.

1357
01:34:22,191 --> 01:34:24,569
Mani, your cabin is over there.

1358
01:34:25,088 --> 01:34:26,288
Joe.
- Yes, sir.

1359
01:34:27,023 --> 01:34:28,829
Please take him. Go.
- Please come with me.

1360
01:34:28,909 --> 01:34:30,148
Come, sir.
- This way.

1361
01:34:30,986 --> 01:34:32,056
Come, Brother.

1362
01:34:35,213 --> 01:34:36,986
Mani, you will sit over there?
- Yes, Brother.

1363
01:34:44,753 --> 01:34:49,056
It's says 'Mani', right?

1364
01:34:50,991 --> 01:34:53,724
No, it's says 'Marketing Manager'.

1365
01:34:55,757 --> 01:34:57,832
Thank God it's just the two of us here.

1366
01:35:01,422 --> 01:35:04,225
Mani, sit on that rolling chair,
I want to see.

1367
01:35:05,101 --> 01:35:06,463
Bless me.
- Hey...

1368
01:35:09,576 --> 01:35:10,506
What are you doing?

1369
01:35:10,586 --> 01:35:14,052
It's all because of you, Brother.
You're no less than God to me.

1370
01:35:19,872 --> 01:35:21,386
Sit over there.

1371
01:35:22,359 --> 01:35:25,744
I should be going from here.

1372
01:35:37,692 --> 01:35:40,492
Dada had sent for me.
- Yes, come.

1373
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:47,594
Come, Maheshwar. Sit.

1374
01:35:47,674 --> 01:35:49,032
I am fine.

1375
01:35:50,146 --> 01:35:52,805
Manager, make a drink for Maheshwar.

1376
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:54,892
No, thanks.

1377
01:35:55,313 --> 01:35:56,935
You don't drink?

1378
01:35:57,015 --> 01:35:59,540
I do.
- He's drinks a lot.

1379
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:00,999
He's feeling shy.

1380
01:36:01,313 --> 01:36:04,902
Even if he drinks more than you,
he still remains steady. Mahesh.

1381
01:36:05,994 --> 01:36:07,338
The liquor is expensive
and also for free.

1382
01:36:12,873 --> 01:36:14,289
Only in one break.

1383
01:36:14,862 --> 01:36:17,262
Maheshwar, do you know him?

1384
01:36:18,392 --> 01:36:20,856
You must've heard of him for sure,
he is Rambo.

1385
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:23,927
Rambo? Please hold this.

1386
01:36:24,007 --> 01:36:26,586
I've never seen Veerappan,
you look like his maternal cousin.

1387
01:36:26,666 --> 01:36:29,650
I am so fortunate. Kiss me.

1388
01:36:30,212 --> 01:36:33,553
I've heard a lot about your bravery.

1389
01:36:33,633 --> 01:36:37,585
Mahesh, do you why Rambo
has come this far to meet dad?

1390
01:36:38,177 --> 01:36:41,042
No, I don't.
- Rambo needs your help.

1391
01:36:41,122 --> 01:36:43,863
He says only you can help him.

1392
01:36:44,523 --> 01:36:47,343
Raghuveer, the ranger of Rampur Jungle

1393
01:36:47,463 --> 01:36:51,246
he never content no matter
how much money we give him.

1394
01:36:51,326 --> 01:36:56,371
He has seized my stuff worth 4 crores.

1395
01:36:56,451 --> 01:36:57,571
What stuff?

1396
01:36:58,742 --> 01:36:59,834
Sandalwood.

1397
01:37:01,606 --> 01:37:04,915
He has taken my stuff into his custody.

1398
01:37:04,995 --> 01:37:07,455
He has deployed
forest officers to watch it.

1399
01:37:07,535 --> 01:37:11,156
He has ordered to shoot me at sight.

1400
01:37:11,236 --> 01:37:12,951
I am unable to get my stuff.

1401
01:37:13,031 --> 01:37:16,432
But I know it's possible only by you.

1402
01:37:16,512 --> 01:37:18,713
You will have to pay for it.

1403
01:37:18,793 --> 01:37:22,366
Hereafter, you will have to deliver
marijuana at my doorstep.

1404
01:37:22,446 --> 01:37:23,512
Do you agree?

1405
01:37:23,988 --> 01:37:26,301
It's a child's play for Mahesh.

1406
01:37:28,377 --> 01:37:29,955
Isn't it?
- No, it's not.

1407
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:33,321
I've never done anything as such.

1408
01:37:35,332 --> 01:37:38,251
But I can't say no to you, I will try.

1409
01:37:40,478 --> 01:37:42,028
I'd need my uncle's help.

1410
01:37:46,417 --> 01:37:47,693
Be prepared.

1411
01:38:06,618 --> 01:38:07,915
Uncle!

1412
01:38:30,464 --> 01:38:32,724
It's worth 4 crores in the market.

1413
01:38:32,804 --> 01:38:34,599
Pay me only 2 crores.

1414
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:36,976
Why are you hesitating so much?

1415
01:38:37,056 --> 01:38:39,798
I will get the stuff cleared
from the check post.

1416
01:38:41,095 --> 01:38:42,252
Hello.

1417
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:46,890
Pratap.
- What happened, sir?

1418
01:38:46,970 --> 01:38:48,478
The sandalwood have been stolen.

1419
01:38:48,558 --> 01:38:50,424
I know it's Rambo's handiwork.

1420
01:38:50,504 --> 01:38:51,753
Search everywhere.
- Sir.

1421
01:38:51,833 --> 01:38:54,142
Search the entire jungle,
alert every check post. - Sir.

1422
01:38:54,222 --> 01:38:56,651
The stuff shouldn't be taken out
of the jungle. Do you get it?

1423
01:39:24,976 --> 01:39:27,095
Sir, the checking has been tightened.

1424
01:39:27,175 --> 01:39:28,770
The officer is very upset.

1425
01:39:29,149 --> 01:39:31,147
His men are deployed
in the entire forest.

1426
01:39:31,227 --> 01:39:33,893
You need to think of a foolproof plan
to get the stuff out of the check post.

1427
01:39:34,455 --> 01:39:38,585
Lord Shiva is the superior.

1428
01:39:38,665 --> 01:39:42,921
Lord Jesus is the superior.

1429
01:39:43,001 --> 01:39:45,451
Lord Shiva is the superior.

1430
01:39:45,531 --> 01:39:49,062
Is it a festival today?
- Yes, it's Good Friday today.

1431
01:39:49,278 --> 01:39:50,844
They take out procession.

1432
01:39:51,082 --> 01:39:55,006
Then there's no need to be afraid,
Lord will show us the way.

1433
01:39:57,114 --> 01:40:02,434
"You're the giver, you're the God."

1434
01:40:02,514 --> 01:40:08,155
"The universe exists because of You."

1435
01:40:08,235 --> 01:40:10,371
Sir, did the members of our group
pass this way?

1436
01:40:10,451 --> 01:40:11,863
They are not sure of the route.

1437
01:40:11,943 --> 01:40:13,560
I hope...
- They just passed this way.

1438
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:15,896
Sir, donate some money,
God will bless you.

1439
01:40:15,976 --> 01:40:17,733
You will be warded off
by evil spell, if any.

1440
01:40:17,813 --> 01:40:19,581
We don't force you for donation.

1441
01:40:20,802 --> 01:40:21,754
Here you go.

1442
01:40:21,834 --> 01:40:23,105
Rs. 500?

1443
01:40:23,299 --> 01:40:24,802
You're quite generous.

1444
01:40:24,986 --> 01:40:25,894
Open the gate, let them go.

1445
01:40:25,974 --> 01:40:30,518
"You're the only faithful."

1446
01:40:32,464 --> 01:40:36,021
Wonderful!
They fooled the police officer.

1447
01:40:37,253 --> 01:40:39,585
They made crosses with the sandalwood,

1448
01:40:39,665 --> 01:40:41,239
changed the colour
by applying tar on them

1449
01:40:41,319 --> 01:40:44,039
and used incense sticks
to get rid of the sandalwood odor.

1450
01:40:44,119 --> 01:40:45,120
You're amazing, Maheshwar.

1451
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:47,649
Dada, he's a gem of a man.

1452
01:40:48,244 --> 01:40:50,388
Keep him close to your heart.

1453
01:40:51,101 --> 01:40:54,734
He's one in a million.

1454
01:40:55,177 --> 01:40:56,269
Stop kidding me.

1455
01:40:56,572 --> 01:41:00,355
Maheshwar, our stuff is lying
in the state border,

1456
01:41:00,628 --> 01:41:04,152
I want you to fetch it.

1457
01:41:04,487 --> 01:41:05,741
The task is risky.

1458
01:41:06,585 --> 01:41:09,309
But I know you will do it. Won't you?

1459
01:41:17,408 --> 01:41:18,878
Maina...

1460
01:41:19,051 --> 01:41:22,657
Don't scream or else she'll get angry.
- Good night.

1461
01:41:22,848 --> 01:41:24,859
Good night.
- Good night.

1462
01:41:27,843 --> 01:41:29,000
Maina...

1463
01:41:39,991 --> 01:41:41,310
Is Maina inside?

1464
01:41:42,672 --> 01:41:44,870
What?
- Is my wife Maina inside?

1465
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:45,991
I am Maina.

1466
01:41:47,072 --> 01:41:48,316
What's the matter with you?

1467
01:41:48,396 --> 01:41:51,723
Seeing your attire,
I thought Julie is here as a witch.

1468
01:41:51,843 --> 01:41:53,880
Shut up.

1469
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:56,166
She looks more beautiful than Julie.
- Maina...

1470
01:41:56,393 --> 01:41:57,658
Maina...
- Dad.

1471
01:41:58,458 --> 01:42:02,301
Who bought new dress and toy for you?

1472
01:42:02,381 --> 01:42:03,497
Ms. Julie bought them.

1473
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:04,810
Shut up.
- Uncle bought them.

1474
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:07,145
It's uncle Mani.
- Brother...

1475
01:42:07,545 --> 01:42:10,118
Mani...
- I received my first salary today.

1476
01:42:11,224 --> 01:42:12,727
I bought clothes for you.

1477
01:42:19,689 --> 01:42:20,900
Uncle.
- Yes.

1478
01:42:21,857 --> 01:42:25,057
Mani bought new clothes for me.

1479
01:42:26,073 --> 01:42:27,359
Maina...

1480
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:29,241
You...

1481
01:42:31,403 --> 01:42:34,574
Mani has grown up.
- Uncle, shirt fabric for you.

1482
01:42:34,654 --> 01:42:36,411
I didn't a shirt of your size.

1483
01:42:36,671 --> 01:42:38,822
There are dresses for your wife
and children too. - Excuse me.

1484
01:42:38,902 --> 01:42:40,757
Didn't you buy anything for me?
- Of course, I have.

1485
01:42:40,837 --> 01:42:42,822
I have bought this for you.
- How sweet of you.

1486
01:42:43,138 --> 01:42:44,111
Thank you.

1487
01:42:44,191 --> 01:42:46,900
What are you doing?
It's body spray.

1488
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:47,959
A new brand?

1489
01:42:48,039 --> 01:42:49,624
You need to spray it on your body.

1490
01:42:50,965 --> 01:42:52,619
Then when will I drink it?

1491
01:42:52,699 --> 01:42:54,265
Let me try it on him.

1492
01:42:54,762 --> 01:42:58,254
What are you doing?
- You haven't bathed for days.

1493
01:42:58,334 --> 01:43:00,179
Uncle...
- What are you saying?

1494
01:43:00,741 --> 01:43:01,898
Come.

1495
01:43:01,978 --> 01:43:03,757
Uncle, look at her.

1496
01:43:04,085 --> 01:43:08,333
Don't we look like newly wedded couple?

1497
01:43:08,413 --> 01:43:11,177
Let go.
- How does the shirt look?

1498
01:43:11,257 --> 01:43:12,550
It's Julie's favorite colour.

1499
01:43:12,630 --> 01:43:16,892
Shut up. - You look good
in traditional dress, not in this.

1500
01:43:18,535 --> 01:43:19,627
What's wrong, Uncle?

1501
01:43:21,368 --> 01:43:24,453
Mahesh, I want to go back to village.

1502
01:43:25,047 --> 01:43:26,583
What's the hurry, Uncle?

1503
01:43:26,663 --> 01:43:29,069
Are you missing your mother-in-law?

1504
01:43:29,149 --> 01:43:30,604
Nothing of that sort.

1505
01:43:30,939 --> 01:43:32,637
I want to see my children.

1506
01:43:32,717 --> 01:43:35,451
Do you really want to see them or
you're planning to have more children?

1507
01:43:36,478 --> 01:43:39,051
Don't you wish to go back to village?

1508
01:43:39,678 --> 01:43:40,748
Of course, I do.

1509
01:43:41,516 --> 01:43:43,580
We belong to our village.

1510
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:46,636
But the case needs to be closed.

1511
01:43:47,047 --> 01:43:50,009
By the way, Dada has promised
to have the cases closed.

1512
01:43:51,566 --> 01:43:53,187
Pull over.

1513
01:43:58,106 --> 01:44:00,372
Mani, carry on, you got to get to work.

1514
01:44:00,452 --> 01:44:01,846
Okay.
- I will go from here.

1515
01:44:08,721 --> 01:44:11,662
Hey, get him.
- Who are you?

1516
01:44:11,742 --> 01:44:13,640
Get him.
- Let go of me.

1517
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,504
Let go of me.
- Come on.

1518
01:44:15,584 --> 01:44:17,298
What have I done?
- Move.

1519
01:44:30,928 --> 01:44:32,323
What happened to Mr. Diwakar?

1520
01:44:32,403 --> 01:44:33,550
The tiger killed him.

1521
01:44:33,670 --> 01:44:35,890
Who else other than Maheshwar
will protect us?

1522
01:44:36,497 --> 01:44:38,788
Mr. Diwakar also
got killed by the tiger.

1523
01:44:39,599 --> 01:44:42,886
He went with the
newly appointed forest Ranger.

1524
01:44:58,474 --> 01:45:02,161
Sir, we should've come here
during Maheshwar's presence.

1525
01:45:03,015 --> 01:45:05,037
You're Maheshwar's stooge,
don't talk rubbish.

1526
01:45:05,117 --> 01:45:07,858
The government has appointed me
to catch the tiger.

1527
01:45:07,938 --> 01:45:09,278
Find it.

1528
01:45:41,904 --> 01:45:44,563
Come on. This way. Quick.

1529
01:45:48,293 --> 01:45:49,835
Let go.

1530
01:46:53,573 --> 01:46:55,141
Diwakar...
- Let go.

1531
01:46:56,957 --> 01:46:59,681
Stay put, the tiger is right behind.

1532
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:01,195
Don't move.

1533
01:47:14,438 --> 01:47:15,562
Diwakar...

1534
01:47:31,328 --> 01:47:34,150
We're praying for Maheshwar's return.

1535
01:47:34,463 --> 01:47:36,193
Balram, where is he?

1536
01:47:36,939 --> 01:47:38,474
He must brought back.

1537
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:46,377
I've no idea.

1538
01:47:47,483 --> 01:47:48,683
There's no news about him.

1539
01:47:50,013 --> 01:47:51,321
He will definitely come.

1540
01:47:51,569 --> 01:47:55,559
He has to come to drive away
his people's sorrow.

1541
01:47:58,416 --> 01:47:59,865
Maheshwar.
- Yes.

1542
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:02,276
I know you're worried.

1543
01:48:02,741 --> 01:48:04,557
I want to tell you something.

1544
01:48:04,773 --> 01:48:06,287
I am in a fix myself.

1545
01:48:06,367 --> 01:48:09,646
But I promise you,
I will bring your brother back.

1546
01:48:11,084 --> 01:48:14,414
I guess the forest officer
is trying to avenge you.

1547
01:48:14,494 --> 01:48:16,392
Because your brother
was kidnapped from the village.

1548
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:27,474
Dad, I received information from
our informer that Mani has been confined

1549
01:48:27,554 --> 01:48:29,077
in a workshop at Mumlapur.

1550
01:48:33,715 --> 01:48:37,294
That means, it's Kader's handiwork.

1551
01:48:40,675 --> 01:48:44,794
Kader has avenged Maheshwar,
because he had hit him.

1552
01:48:45,021 --> 01:48:47,648
That's why he kidnapped his brother.

1553
01:48:52,268 --> 01:48:55,543
Manager, summon your men,

1554
01:48:55,623 --> 01:48:57,554
I have to bring his brother at any cost.

1555
01:48:57,922 --> 01:48:58,970
No,

1556
01:48:59,871 --> 01:49:01,190
I will go there alone.

1557
01:49:02,141 --> 01:49:03,579
I am their enemy,

1558
01:49:04,606 --> 01:49:06,336
so I will go there alone.

1559
01:49:18,895 --> 01:49:19,933
Hey...

1560
01:49:20,774 --> 01:49:22,709
Come, Maheshwar.

1561
01:49:23,087 --> 01:49:26,428
I kidnapped your brother
because I wanted to meet you.

1562
01:49:28,384 --> 01:49:29,574
Release my brother.

1563
01:49:29,844 --> 01:49:31,271
Talk to me.

1564
01:49:31,351 --> 01:49:33,969
Alright.
I heard you're going great guns.

1565
01:49:34,049 --> 01:49:36,430
You're managing to make away

1566
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:41,126
with marijuana stealthily
from the forest.

1567
01:49:41,579 --> 01:49:42,984
Sit.

1568
01:49:44,433 --> 01:49:45,741
Sit.

1569
01:49:46,638 --> 01:49:50,152
Maheshwar, I know you did it
for your brother.

1570
01:49:50,746 --> 01:49:52,704
Then, how could I spare him.

1571
01:49:52,784 --> 01:49:56,444
Water?
- Mani has not wronged, he's innocent.

1572
01:49:56,524 --> 01:49:58,260
I agree he is innocent.

1573
01:49:58,704 --> 01:50:00,044
And you?

1574
01:50:01,406 --> 01:50:05,611
You've become
Dada Giriraj's right hand.

1575
01:50:05,892 --> 01:50:07,924
Tell me what you know about him.

1576
01:50:08,004 --> 01:50:11,503
I've been chasing him
past fourteen months.

1577
01:50:12,735 --> 01:50:16,790
A local goon from Mangalpur
has become a gangster.

1578
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:19,482
And he's running illegal businesses
in the name of Giriraj Pharmacy.

1579
01:50:19,602 --> 01:50:20,705
Are you aware of it?

1580
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:26,187
He sells marijuana in the pretext
of Ayurvedic medicines.

1581
01:50:26,501 --> 01:50:28,804
He makes Hash of high quality.

1582
01:50:32,252 --> 01:50:34,644
He supplies marijuana
to foreign countries in huge quantity

1583
01:50:34,764 --> 01:50:36,369
in the pretext of Ayurvedic medicines.

1584
01:50:36,449 --> 01:50:39,710
Giriraj Pharmacy has started
huge international markets.

1585
01:50:40,283 --> 01:50:44,488
And your brother is the
marketing manager of the company.

1586
01:50:44,802 --> 01:50:46,784
I am unaware of it, sir.

1587
01:50:47,541 --> 01:50:50,557
They told me they were
making medicine for cancer.

1588
01:50:50,637 --> 01:50:52,124
Medicine for cancer?

1589
01:50:52,204 --> 01:50:53,854
Really?

1590
01:50:54,114 --> 01:50:59,762
The managed to bring even your brother
who's MBA graduate, under their influence.

1591
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:04,389
They must've told you I've been
posted at the village to arrest you.

1592
01:51:04,865 --> 01:51:08,660
They lied to you so that you come
under their influence and work for them.

1593
01:51:09,438 --> 01:51:13,860
In fact, I was there to arrest Rambo,
the drug peddler.

1594
01:51:14,454 --> 01:51:16,746
If I file this case,

1595
01:51:16,826 --> 01:51:19,945
both you and brother won't get bail.

1596
01:51:21,469 --> 01:51:22,690
I can save you.

1597
01:51:22,770 --> 01:51:25,263
But you must help me.

1598
01:51:26,161 --> 01:51:29,763
I have no proof
to the illegal business running

1599
01:51:29,843 --> 01:51:31,666
in Dada Giriraj's Ayurveda factory.

1600
01:51:32,336 --> 01:51:34,520
I will let you go if you get me proof.

1601
01:51:34,704 --> 01:51:37,925
His men will get arrested too.

1602
01:51:39,393 --> 01:51:42,247
Your brother can do the job easily.

1603
01:51:43,025 --> 01:51:48,582
If you do it, I promise, your names
won't be mentioned in the case.

1604
01:51:54,089 --> 01:51:55,613
We received wrong information.

1605
01:51:55,970 --> 01:51:59,708
It was police who kidnapped Mani,
not Kader.

1606
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:03,723
Maheshwar has taught
a good lesson to the police,

1607
01:52:03,843 --> 01:52:05,578
he will bringing his brother back.

1608
01:52:05,967 --> 01:52:07,708
The information is accurate, Dada.

1609
01:52:07,788 --> 01:52:10,980
I found out myself,
two policemen have been hospitalized.

1610
01:52:13,337 --> 01:52:16,364
What about Maheshwar?
- I guess he's back.

1611
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,578
Maheshwar, what happened?

1612
01:52:27,141 --> 01:52:29,465
When I got there,
I found several policemen.

1613
01:52:29,545 --> 01:52:32,368
They were torturing him,
he was being interrogated.

1614
01:52:32,887 --> 01:52:37,849
They said we don't manufacture medicine
with marijuana in the factory...

1615
01:52:38,444 --> 01:52:40,963
What did he say?
- Hash.

1616
01:52:45,688 --> 01:52:49,494
I told them we do use marijuana,
but we use it to manufacture medicine.

1617
01:52:49,786 --> 01:52:52,531
I thrashed them and brought him.

1618
01:52:53,850 --> 01:52:55,180
Will there be a problem?

1619
01:52:56,488 --> 01:52:59,904
No. Go, I will handle everything.
- Okay.

1620
01:53:00,628 --> 01:53:01,564
Let's go.

1621
01:53:10,634 --> 01:53:12,321
Dad, the matter is quite serious.

1622
01:53:12,401 --> 01:53:15,040
The police had nabbed Mani,
they can get to the factory any moment.

1623
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:16,662
It's not so easy,

1624
01:53:16,782 --> 01:53:18,358
the police will never
be able to get there.

1625
01:53:18,618 --> 01:53:20,056
Even if we feel

1626
01:53:20,575 --> 01:53:23,560
Mani has exposed us,

1627
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:25,983
he won't be able to get away.

1628
01:53:27,291 --> 01:53:29,680
It's risky to keep the stuff
in the factory,

1629
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:33,075
it's better to shift it.

1630
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:37,193
I spoke to the agents in Europe,
they will be here tomorrow.

1631
01:53:37,993 --> 01:53:41,074
Before that, we must
move the stuff to Mangalpur.

1632
01:53:41,809 --> 01:53:44,231
They will take the deliver
directly from there.

1633
01:53:45,373 --> 01:53:47,719
Get the stuff loaded
in Maheshwar's lorry.

1634
01:53:52,724 --> 01:53:54,324
Don't go with him.

1635
01:53:55,098 --> 01:53:58,536
Because I smell something fishy.

1636
01:54:55,462 --> 01:54:57,239
Make sure Maheshwar doesn't find out.

1637
01:55:05,801 --> 01:55:07,422
I ask you for the last time.

1638
01:55:07,866 --> 01:55:09,315
To whom did you send the video?

1639
01:55:42,057 --> 01:55:44,025
Sir. - Where's the manager?
- He's upstairs.

1640
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:51,026
Who is he? Tell me.

1641
01:55:54,853 --> 01:55:56,702
Mani...
- Hit him.

1642
01:55:57,470 --> 01:56:00,010
Shiva, what's going on?
Why are you beating him?

1643
01:56:02,631 --> 01:56:03,712
Betrayal.

1644
01:56:04,004 --> 01:56:07,777
I can never forgive the one
who betrays me.

1645
01:56:07,857 --> 01:56:08,912
What are you talking about?

1646
01:56:09,453 --> 01:56:10,858
He is our friend.

1647
01:56:13,566 --> 01:56:17,587
Then ask your friend
to whom he sent the video.

1648
01:56:20,225 --> 01:56:21,566
I will never tell you.

1649
01:56:23,372 --> 01:56:25,841
You...
- Shiva, let go.

1650
01:56:25,961 --> 01:56:27,469
I will kill him.

1651
01:56:27,549 --> 01:56:28,788
Mani, tell him.

1652
01:56:29,036 --> 01:56:31,577
Don't beat him.
What are you doing?

1653
01:56:32,043 --> 01:56:33,189
Mani...

1654
01:56:34,173 --> 01:56:36,432
I will extract the truth from him.
- Don't do that, Shiva.

1655
01:56:36,757 --> 01:56:38,519
It was I who brought him here.

1656
01:56:46,539 --> 01:56:47,901
Maheshwar, sit.

1657
01:56:48,409 --> 01:56:49,857
I have parked the lorry down.

1658
01:56:50,366 --> 01:56:54,072
Good. The Ayurvedic boxes
that will loaded in your lorry,

1659
01:56:54,152 --> 01:56:55,748
you will take it to Mangalpur.

1660
01:56:55,828 --> 01:56:57,326
Our men are over there.

1661
01:56:57,856 --> 01:57:00,418
Here's the details of the product.

1662
01:57:00,948 --> 01:57:02,861
Here's the rest of the documents.

1663
01:57:02,941 --> 01:57:05,030
Produce them at the check post.
- Okay.

1664
01:57:06,544 --> 01:57:07,744
Where is Shiva?

1665
01:57:08,068 --> 01:57:11,235
Shiva is handling a cheating case.

1666
01:57:11,315 --> 01:57:14,987
He won't be able to accompany you,
you leave.

1667
01:57:59,389 --> 01:58:00,394
Kill him!

1668
01:58:24,554 --> 01:58:26,067
No!

1669
01:58:26,683 --> 01:58:27,873
No!

1670
01:58:30,438 --> 01:58:32,427
Brother...

1671
01:58:32,687 --> 01:58:34,254
Brother...

1672
01:58:38,409 --> 01:58:40,096
Brother...

1673
01:59:12,870 --> 01:59:14,957
Brother...

1674
01:59:36,569 --> 01:59:38,515
Don't let him go!

1675
01:59:54,611 --> 01:59:55,703
What are you waiting for?

1676
02:00:52,657 --> 02:00:54,138
Brother...

1677
02:01:31,499 --> 02:01:33,153
Shiva...

1678
02:01:35,564 --> 02:01:36,602
Shiva...

1679
02:01:58,384 --> 02:02:00,977
Surround them! Hurry up!

1680
02:02:01,398 --> 02:02:02,934
Nobody should escape.

1681
02:02:09,933 --> 02:02:11,328
Drop your gun, now.

1682
02:02:33,768 --> 02:02:34,978
Fire!

1683
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:40,081
Darn it! Follow him!

1684
02:02:40,884 --> 02:02:42,170
Come on, hurry up.

1685
02:02:43,543 --> 02:02:44,533
Maheshwar...
- Sir...

1686
02:02:44,613 --> 02:02:46,376
I didn't...
- I will handle everything.

1687
02:02:46,456 --> 02:02:48,084
Go to your village soon.

1688
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:02,912
Any news?

1689
02:03:05,312 --> 02:03:07,139
Maheshwar

1690
02:03:07,993 --> 02:03:09,171
is not here.

1691
02:03:09,614 --> 02:03:11,290
I've no idea where he is.

1692
02:03:11,539 --> 02:03:16,408
We must lay a trap to get him.

1693
02:03:16,488 --> 02:03:17,879
And then deal with him.

1694
02:03:39,369 --> 02:03:40,476
Mahesh.
- Yes.

1695
02:03:45,045 --> 02:03:46,494
Did you see the consequences

1696
02:03:47,261 --> 02:03:49,056
of sending me away from the village?

1697
02:03:52,705 --> 02:03:55,764
You thought I will be safe in the city.

1698
02:03:57,018 --> 02:03:58,586
But you must've realized

1699
02:03:59,818 --> 02:04:01,785
that human beings

1700
02:04:02,693 --> 02:04:05,925
are more dangerous
than the animals in the forest.

1701
02:04:06,671 --> 02:04:09,093
We can sense the danger from an animal,

1702
02:04:09,450 --> 02:04:10,596
we can fight it.

1703
02:04:12,190 --> 02:04:14,212
How can you be alert
from a human being

1704
02:04:15,531 --> 02:04:16,925
who first creates a bond,

1705
02:04:17,293 --> 02:04:18,763
win our trust

1706
02:04:20,028 --> 02:04:22,181
and then break it?

1707
02:04:23,002 --> 02:04:24,678
He betrays us.

1708
02:04:25,759 --> 02:04:28,094
Least did we know
something like this would happen.

1709
02:04:28,786 --> 02:04:30,300
I didn't tell anything to Maina.

1710
02:04:30,689 --> 02:04:33,352
She thinks Mani met
with a major accident.

1711
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:43,720
Maheshwar, where have
you been for so long?

1712
02:04:44,974 --> 02:04:46,661
The tiger entered the village again.

1713
02:04:51,666 --> 02:04:55,325
It took away seven people in a month.

1714
02:04:55,628 --> 02:04:57,055
We were desperately waiting for you.

1715
02:04:57,509 --> 02:04:59,596
But there was no trace of you.

1716
02:05:03,271 --> 02:05:07,313
Maheshwar, my only granddaughter Babita,

1717
02:05:07,897 --> 02:05:10,340
my only support,

1718
02:05:11,216 --> 02:05:14,888
the tiger took her away last night.

1719
02:05:31,066 --> 02:05:33,920
Had I told you, you would fret.

1720
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,617
Moreover, you were already in a fix.

1721
02:05:40,843 --> 02:05:42,248
What are you thinking?

1722
02:05:42,908 --> 02:05:45,545
Are you again planning to kill the tiger?

1723
02:05:49,340 --> 02:05:53,361
Look, Chakki and I have nobody
other than you.

1724
02:06:06,623 --> 02:06:07,985
Pay heed to me.

1725
02:06:11,291 --> 02:06:14,058
How could you even say that?
Have you lost your mind?

1726
02:06:17,258 --> 02:06:20,848
She was a little girl like Chakki.
Had Chakki suffered the same fate,

1727
02:06:22,262 --> 02:06:23,819
would we keep quiet?

1728
02:06:24,446 --> 02:06:25,678
Would we still do nothing?

1729
02:06:29,711 --> 02:06:31,213
No, I won't let you go.

1730
02:06:56,168 --> 02:06:58,946
Maheshwar, Sashi was
taken away by the tiger,

1731
02:06:59,443 --> 02:07:01,454
we rescue him with great difficulty.

1732
02:07:18,794 --> 02:07:19,940
Maheshwar...

1733
02:07:24,924 --> 02:07:26,542
I have realized that

1734
02:07:26,662 --> 02:07:30,343
the gun alone is not enough
to catch the tiger.

1735
02:07:30,423 --> 02:07:31,760
You're right.

1736
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,446
The gun won't help.

1737
02:07:33,684 --> 02:07:35,349
To kill the tiger,

1738
02:07:35,429 --> 02:07:39,336
one has to get hold
of its throat straight.

1739
02:07:39,416 --> 02:07:42,525
One has to sense its moves.

1740
02:07:42,605 --> 02:07:47,042
Not everyone can kill a tiger,
except Maheshwar.

1741
02:07:47,122 --> 02:07:48,890
Maheshwar, I've realized

1742
02:07:49,096 --> 02:07:51,625
why the villagers have
so much faith in you.

1743
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:54,555
I have received the permission
to kill the man-eater.

1744
02:07:54,635 --> 02:07:56,858
Look, it's the order
from the forest department.

1745
02:07:57,099 --> 02:07:59,975
Only you can save their lives.

1746
02:08:29,656 --> 02:08:30,780
Who did it?

1747
02:08:32,132 --> 02:08:35,224
Dada... Dada Giriraj.

1748
02:08:36,283 --> 02:08:39,559
He said your life is at stake

1749
02:08:39,639 --> 02:08:41,580
and took me to the jungle by deceit.

1750
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:44,164
If Mahesh goes to the jungle,
he informs us.

1751
02:08:44,244 --> 02:08:46,856
I happened to meet him in the jungle,
he asked me to bring you.

1752
02:08:51,206 --> 02:08:52,352
Balram...

1753
02:08:53,152 --> 02:08:54,828
Hey... Sashi...

1754
02:08:54,908 --> 02:08:56,341
Balram...

1755
02:08:57,476 --> 02:08:59,087
Balram, save me.

1756
02:09:10,128 --> 02:09:11,372
Balram...

1757
02:09:11,858 --> 02:09:13,804
Maheshwar's right hand.

1758
02:09:14,042 --> 02:09:17,772
Just as close as
Lord Krishna and Balram.

1759
02:09:18,183 --> 02:09:22,046
But unfortunately,
it's all going to be over,

1760
02:09:22,457 --> 02:09:24,100
because you're going to die.

1761
02:09:24,414 --> 02:09:27,344
And the good news should be
passed on to Maheshwar.

1762
02:09:27,424 --> 02:09:31,441
He will inform Maheshwar
about your death.

1763
02:09:32,717 --> 02:09:34,209
Balram...

1764
02:09:36,879 --> 02:09:38,587
No...

1765
02:09:39,193 --> 02:09:40,750
Balram...

1766
02:09:41,344 --> 02:09:42,501
Balram...

1767
02:09:52,559 --> 02:09:54,007
The village head was right.

1768
02:09:56,548 --> 02:09:57,726
Whether the enemy

1769
02:09:59,813 --> 02:10:02,353
is the tiger or human being,

1770
02:10:03,442 --> 02:10:04,609
he should be

1771
02:10:05,917 --> 02:10:07,733
killed in his territory.

1772
02:10:11,550 --> 02:10:13,258
It's the rule of the jungle.

1773
02:10:20,988 --> 02:10:22,945
He will learn the lesson of his life.

1774
02:10:25,768 --> 02:10:27,704
He calls himself tiger.

1775
02:10:27,931 --> 02:10:30,590
And I am the hunter.
I will deal with him.

1776
02:13:35,572 --> 02:13:38,361
"He is a fighter."

1777
02:13:38,441 --> 02:13:42,891
"He is a fighter.
Everyone knows it."

1778
02:13:45,216 --> 02:13:52,740
"He doesn't miss his aim.
He is a real fighter."

1779
02:14:15,235 --> 02:14:16,500
Darn it.

1780
02:14:18,511 --> 02:14:19,927
I won't spare him.

1781
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:05,264
"He is a fighter."

1782
02:17:05,344 --> 02:17:09,805
"He is a fighter.
Everyone knows it."

1783
02:17:12,215 --> 02:17:19,795
"He doesn't miss his aim.
He is a real fighter."

1784
02:17:42,924 --> 02:17:44,394
Shocked, aren't you?

1785
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:48,739
Balram will have to pay a price
for Shiva's death.

1786
02:17:48,819 --> 02:17:50,934
If you have the guts, save him.

1787
02:17:56,309 --> 02:17:58,168
I didn't kill your son.

1788
02:17:59,995 --> 02:18:01,466
He was killed accidentally.

1789
02:18:01,546 --> 02:18:03,271
But I lost my son.

1790
02:18:03,520 --> 02:18:07,632
Even you should feel the pain
of losing the loved ones.

1791
02:18:24,170 --> 02:18:25,564
Won't you rescue him?

1792
02:19:40,172 --> 02:19:41,275
Uncle...

1793
02:21:15,799 --> 02:21:16,870
Hey...
