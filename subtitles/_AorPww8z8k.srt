1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,990
How much can you make a business with Layers?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We can make millions

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
As a creator, there are many ways to earn money

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We should know what we shouldn't do

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,980
I think that technology is coming

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,980
I don't want to tell you

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Please cut this part

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,990
Am I fake?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Am I pretending?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today we have a creator with us

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Who you know for technology

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,969
But I think of him as a good businessman

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Normally we hear that to make a business

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We should have an idea

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Then we make a business and do marketing

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But he has reversed this wheel

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
First he created a distribution

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,979
Then he is making a business

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,990
And I think he is making a business in a very smart way

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In some places, I am having a problem

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,979
I think I should ask questions

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So we will ask questions

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let's know about him

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,979
Hello friends, I am Shlok Srivastav

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We are making tech videos

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We have been making videos for 10 years

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And along with that

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I have a passion

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In every person

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,969
I also have a passion for design and aesthetics

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I always wanted to make something

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In which I can put my love

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If it reaches the audience through physical products

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It will be great

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So we have built a clothing brand

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And a mobile accessories brand

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Apart from that

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,375
We have executed a lot of social media and marketing

39
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:25,959
projects

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
In the last 6-7 years

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It has been an insightful and interesting journey

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We have done a lot of big launches

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,950
The next few years are definitely going to be very strong

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know how to praise myself

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You are doing very well

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Tell me

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,980
When you started the YouTube channel

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Did you decide to launch a product?

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Or was it a journey as a creator?

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
While doing it

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When you got the audience

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,980
Did you think of selling something?

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
As a creator

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,980
There are a lot of ways to earn money

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Because you have a lot of things

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You can do marketing for a company

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,980
Like there are so many companies

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,979
You can help them in marketing

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We have also built applications

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We have built different things

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And I have noticed that

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,979
There is a different game everywhere

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Making a product is a different game

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,979
Our main goal was to inspire

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Because I saw a problem

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
In India

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,979
There is no shortage of resources

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's not like we make so much food

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That we feed the whole population 3 times

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I faced a problem with the mindset

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So my goal was

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
To make something different

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Something strong

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Something that creates a movement

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And we tried that

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
With layers

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,979
That product was not successful before

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And that product was not in the market

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,979
No one knew what skins were

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,979
There were few people who knew

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But apart from that we created the market

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So when that emotion

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Gets attached to a project

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think it propels it

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Same with clothes

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I saw that all the clothes in India

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,979
Are being sold by international brands

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And Indian brands are selling it cheap

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Some are selling it for 200 rupees

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Some are selling it for 500 rupees

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We are cutting the price

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No one is making such expensive clothes

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So we tried to solve that problem

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It took us a long time to solve that problem

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It took us 3 years to make clothes

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
To make such clothes

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,979
That are dealing with international brands

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It took us 3 years to make the same skins

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
To install the factory

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
To set up the manufacturing

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
To see the operations

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The technologies that are used for that

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I think

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We have to make money

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,979
Business can run only with money

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If there is no money

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Then what is business

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't believe in that

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,979
I think if we want to make something big

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Internationally We need money

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But the goal was to create a movement

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,979
I think we have done that

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
To some extent

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But now the goal is

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
To take the Indian brand

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
To an international level

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have thought about it

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,979
If you count on your hands

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Like we were asking you

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There are so many brands that are selling Indian brands

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,980
We can't count on our fingers

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,980
We don't even know the brands that are selling outside India

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,980
And there are very few brands

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,980
So I think someone has to break the barrier

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Someone has to make international business from India

126
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So we

127
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Go into that risky area

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And do things

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Now it's a stove

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So one thing I wanted to ask

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Which is honest

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You have worked on your personal branding

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Because I think

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I have seen this constantly

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,980
I am from a marketing background

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So I notice small things

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What I noticed

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
When we talked

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There was a fire in the message

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Some of your keywords

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Like we were talking normally

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We were talking like this

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And when we make videos

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We talk like this

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We will do this

146
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Did this happen naturally

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Or did it take time

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Because if I watch old English videos

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
At that time

150
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Body language

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And as we are transitioning to recent

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
There is a difference in our body language

153
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We have changed a lot to make a relation with our audience

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is honest

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes 100%

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Like a person

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I have thought a lot about this

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Am I pretending

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And what happens is

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I have seen myself

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Like every person has a different style

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
When he is going to meet girls

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He becomes sweet

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
When he is going to meet his brothers

165
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He has a different vibe

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Like this

167
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Same person

168
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,980
If he is talking to kids

169
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He becomes sweet

170
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And if he is talking to his friends

171
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He becomes sad

172
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So I saw that

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I used to try to talk sophisticated

174
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Professionally In my college

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Then I thought

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
My friends are coming

177
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
After that

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I felt uncomfortable in English

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,980
Because our mindset is like this

180
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
When do we speak English

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We have to speak formally

182
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It becomes a habit

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Hindi becomes a comfort

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So I imagined

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
My friends are sitting behind

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I am talking to them

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,980
Like when we were talking before

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I was a business owner

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
To a business owner

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But now I know

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,980
Many young entrepreneurs are watching this

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So I want

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
They should also

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Feel the same

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,980
That's why I change a little

196
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So who is your audience

197
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If you imagine

198
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What is their age

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Where do they live

200
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Where are they studying

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So I imagined my audience

202
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
When I started

203
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I imagined my age

204
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,980
Because they are the same type

205
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Who are doing everything

206
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So I imagined

207
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In the beginning

208
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,980
Guys who are interested in tech

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Because usually 5% of the guys are interested in tech

210
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,980
This is the start of YouTube

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Majorly 16 to 24 years old guys

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Who are studying engineering

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Those who are studying coding

214
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Engineering That is my audience

215
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Engineers are interested in technology

216
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They attract them

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If you see anything

218
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They get attracted

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So I took my audience

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And I was not deciding

221
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now it is different

222
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,980
You will be able to notice

223
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
My way of speaking changes

224
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The way of speaking changes

225
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The way of showing things visually changes

226
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
On Instagram

227
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There are a lot of girls on Instagram

228
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
There are a lot of people on Instagram

229
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Who follow for fashion

230
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
There is a different vibe on Instagram

231
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The audience is very different

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,980
People on YouTube know about tech

233
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,980
Let me give you an example

234
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Recently I go out less

235
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I went to the bank

236
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I had to do KYC

237
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I have to go there

238
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,980
I had to change my account

239
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I saw a girl

240
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
She said hi

241
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I watch your videos

242
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Age Reversal

243
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I uploaded this video 2 years ago

244
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I was confused

245
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
She said

246
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,980
I asked where did you see

247
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
She said

248
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,980
By chance we cut the clip

249
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And uploaded it on Facebook

250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,980
She did not know about our long form video

251
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,980
She did not know about tech

252
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
She knew that we upload short clips

253
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
She just saw our video on Facebook

254
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You will not believe

255
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
In our audience

256
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There are only a few Indian cities

257
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There are cities of Bangladesh

258
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There are a few cities outside India

259
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
There are a few cities of US

260
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There are a few cities of Canada

261
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I did not know

262
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Every platform

263
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There is a different audience

264
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And now it has become so different

265
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That everyone has to treat it differently

266
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So there is a different type of content for everyone

267
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes 100%

268
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We are not able to optimize for everyone

269
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,980
I try to make content that

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Can cater to everyone

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Now what happened?

272
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You grew your channel

273
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It became a base

274
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
People were knowing

275
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Your demographic was clear

276
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
A 16-24 year old kid

277
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You made a product around his needs

278
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The first product was Layers

279
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I am also a Layers

280
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Your audience

281
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I will tell you

282
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
When I was doing engineering

283
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I had a Micromax

284
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,980
A116 Micromax was not a good brand

285
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I did not like Micromax

286
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I used skin

287
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Just to hide the Micromesh

288
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,980
At that time all the phones looked the same

289
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The phones were sold on screen size

290
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Today there is a lot of trend

291
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,980
At that time screen size was a big issue

292
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It was a big phone

293
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Micromesh canvas

294
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,605
If I had put a skin on the back, my Micromesh would have

295
00:10:15,605 --> 00:10:15,950
been hidden

296
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So my target

297
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If I think why I used the skin

298
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
To hide the Micromesh

299
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
If we talk about today

300
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The phones become prominent

301
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,980
So according to me most people

302
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't use the skin

303
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,980
If I try to think demographically

304
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Then you tell me

305
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,980
Because I want to know your point of view

306
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I am trying to think

307
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Who buys

308
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
One people

309
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Who like to keep their phones naked

310
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Without cases

311
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And they want scratches on their phones

312
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Second people

313
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,980
Who want to show their phones as a trend

314
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,634
Because now a days most of the phones come in white plain

315
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:53,950
background

316
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
They want something

317
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,980
Or They want to express their emotions

318
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There is one audience

319
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Who wants to show

320
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I am like this

321
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So basically they are expressing their emotions

322
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
If I say third audience

323
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I will say

324
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They are resembling a community

325
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,980
If I talk about my brother

326
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
My brother

327
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,980
Brought a roll from Gafar market

328
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He has

329
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
A 3D printer

330
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He has a CNC printer

331
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So now a days

332
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Models are available online

333
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Of every phone case

334
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So he goes to buy a new phone

335
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,980
He gets the exact same sheet

336
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Printed and put it on his phone

337
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So whenever his phone changes

338
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And he changes his phone a lot

339
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Every 3 months

340
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
His back will always be the same

341
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,980
Technology will change, camera will change

342
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But the look and feel of the phone

343
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Will always be the same

344
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I use my phone

345
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So that I always remember

346
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,980
If someone keeps their phone aside

347
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I always remember my phone

348
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That is his mindset

349
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So I am able to think of these 3 people

350
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,980
You tell me what you thought

351
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
When I started

352
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,980
I was not able to define

353
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It was a mistake

354
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And I was not able to define it

355
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Because at that time

356
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It was not a must to adopt it

357
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
After this product

358
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,980
The audience we wanted to sell

359
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I wanted to sell

360
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It was not well known

361
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,980
There were very few skin men

362
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Delhi, Mumbai

363
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Nehru Place, Gafar

364
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You used to get skin in Gafar

365
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And they used to cut it off with a blade

366
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,980
They used to cut it off

367
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
With a blade

368
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
They used to scratch it

369
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
They used to scratch it

370
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The problem was

371
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It did not glow

372
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I felt that the quality of the skin

373
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Was not that good

374
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And the design was not that good

375
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So we worked hard

376
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
To add texture

377
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And no one was able to copy it

378
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Because the set up was worth crores

379
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,980
If I break down the layers of the business

380
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We removed the need

381
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That this is not a need driven business

382
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There is no need for this product in the market

383
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It is not that

384
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No one wants skin

385
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It is a humanity driven

386
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Or emotional purchase

387
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Who wants to purchase it?

388
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It makes me feel good

389
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,980
I love the design and texture

390
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It is not that

391
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It saves from scratches

392
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It provides protection

393
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But the primary reason

394
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Is that you feel

395
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That you are a part of a community

396
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That is the primary

397
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Need of

398
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Belonging I feel good

399
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Like college students

400
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Represent themselves

401
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
For example

402
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We wear clothes

403
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Like Gucci

404
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Or I wear a watch

405
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It is not that

406
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It solves a functional purpose

407
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Like logo or watch

408
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It is the same watch

409
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It tells me the time

410
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,980
It is not a functional product

411
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It is an emotional purchase

412
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
In my opinion

413
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,980
Emotional purchase is a good thing

414
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Because people say

415
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Don't spend money

416
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Why not?

417
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Everything is so

418
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Emotionally driven

419
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Let me give you an example 22 boys

420
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Are hitting the ball with a stick

421
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,980
And a country of 1 billion

422
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Is watching them

423
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Everyone is happy

424
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Everyone is shouting

425
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The whole country is sad

426
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That they couldn't hit with a stick

427
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
There is no purpose

428
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
There is no logic

429
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Everything is emotional

430
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
If we break down

431
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,980
What is logical 90% of the things we do

432
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Are emotionally driven

433
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
In India

434
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,980
There is no lack of resources

435
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,980
There is a lack of mindset

436
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The same mindset

437
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And the same

438
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
If you go to India

439
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
To meet rich people

440
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I go to clubs

441
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Do you know what kind of people

442
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I meet?

443
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I make henna oil

444
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I make a tyre cover

445
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I make a machine

446
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
To clean the road

447
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I make the threads

448
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And what will happen?

449
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Profit will be 800 crores

450
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Profit will be 600 crores

451
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
In India, the same business

452
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But I think

453
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
From today

454
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The time of internet

455
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
From now

456
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Vanity and emotional businesses

457
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Will be successful

458
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I think

459
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Distribution was created

460
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If we talk about a normal brand

461
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
They also have to sell their skin

462
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Because everyone has money

463
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,980
A person can install a machine

464
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Can bring the same technology

465
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,980
Distribution can also come in India

466
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,980
Distribution will be on every sale

467
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Today I researched 60-70% traffic

468
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Is coming on your website

469
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Because of Shlok

470
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Shlok has generated a lot of business

471
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But today

472
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If a new brand comes

473
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
They have to make their own brand

474
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,980
Maybe they run a ppc campaign

475
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
When someone searches skin

476
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Or layer

477
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
They have to take a lot of tension

478
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
In which

479
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Where you can earn a good margin

480
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,980
By selling a skin for 500

481
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The other person

482
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,980
Can't earn even by selling a skin for 800

483
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,980
Because he has to spend a lot of money

484
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Maybe the business doesn't work

485
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Because people follow Shlok

486
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
People trust Shlok

487
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
People say that I don't care about 100-150

488
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,950
If I have to put a skin, I will put a good one

489
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't want to take a loss

490
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,980
Let me tell you two things

491
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Our mode

492
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Our factory

493
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Because we have increased the entry barrier

494
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
If you want to compete with us

495
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You need factory setup

496
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You need machines, latest technology

497
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You need printing

498
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The 3M paper

499
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We source it from a different country

500
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Our product is the best in India

501
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It is best because

502
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
We have spent money

503
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Entry barrier is of money

504
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No one can make it better than us

505
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
No one

506
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The other thing is

507
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,980
Distribution We have worked hard for it

508
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It is like saying

509
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,980
You are coming to play basketball

510
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You are tall 100% advantage

511
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,980
But I will use that advantage

512
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
If I have any advantage of distribution

513
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,980
I will reach my audience 100%

514
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And I feel

515
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Even empty distribution doesn't work

516
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,980
Let me give you an example

517
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,599
Logan Paul and Mr.

518
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
They are very popular in the US

519
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,980
Logan Paul has 2 million views

520
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
In the last video 2-3 million views

521
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Mr. Beast has 150-200 million 300 million

522
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Distribution is worldwide 150-200 million

523
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Only in US

524
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
In Hindi 10-20 million

525
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Mr. Beast has more than 100% distribution

526
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But Prime

527
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It is a 7 billion dollar business

528
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,799
And Mr.

529
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,000
Beast's fee stable

530
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Is not that good

531
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So I feel

532
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Distribution alone doesn't work

533
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Product should be good

534
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I feel

535
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Product should be good

536
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
If product is not good, then nothing

537
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,980
Product should be better than market

538
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But I feel

539
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
There is a way to spread message

540
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It makes a difference

541
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
People get to know

542
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You are making something good

543
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You are telling the truth

544
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If you work hard, people will buy

545
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,980
It is easy to reach people

546
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It is not that difficult to buy distribution

547
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But it takes money

548
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Most of the companies are in loss

549
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
If you promote in shorts

550
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,980
You will get 40-50 million views

551
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Conversion Conversion is not coming

552
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Distribution is there

553
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Conversion is not coming

554
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Conversion is emotionally driven

555
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
When an influencer is connected

556
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
With a product

557
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You won't be able to buy it

558
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Even if you give 10 lakh rupees

559
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,980
You will get 40 million views

560
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
People will see

561
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But people know it is an ad

562
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
When an influencer is involved in a product

563
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Or the owner

564
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Like I made distribution

565
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I was famous

566
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And I built things

567
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Over a period of time

568
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Now the company is doing the opposite

569
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
They knew they were figuring out a product

570
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
They made their marketing

571
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
They knew what to make

572
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Now the owner is coming

573
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
To make a video

574
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,683
We also saw what the situation is, and the owners

575
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:05,821
themselves are making it, so I think those days have gone

576
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:09,091
that you just sit down and buy the distribution, give 10-20

577
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:12,289
lakhs, spend crores, the distribution will come, the work

578
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:13,692
will be done, those days

579
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:17,069
have gone, because now people are used to sitting idle, the

580
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:20,405
owner himself will have to come and sell, or if he doesn't

581
00:20:20,405 --> 00:20:23,652
come, he will have to learn social media, how content is

582
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:27,001
made, how people's minds have to reach them, that is very

583
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,000
important to me.

584
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,623
It is a big fight for everyone, and if you are doing your

585
00:20:31,623 --> 00:20:34,689
business, then if possible, then instead of paid

586
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:38,419
distribution, focus on building a community, make your own

587
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:42,254
social media, where people trust you, not for your product,

588
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:44,400
but whatever you are delivering,

589
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,357
now try to gather a community together, so that in the

590
00:20:48,357 --> 00:20:52,663
future, when you subconsciously integrate your product, it

591
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:54,000
keeps on selling.

592
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,034
People will say, let's talk about Elon Musk for example, we

593
00:20:58,034 --> 00:21:02,000
have been seeing him working a lot in the personal brand.

594
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,409
100%, at this time, the value of words is very high, and

595
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:11,041
the value of connect is very high, so I think it will be a

596
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,000
major part.

597
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,635
This is a hard question, because our audience enjoys this

598
00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:17,247
discussion. How much business is being made from layers?

599
00:21:17,247 --> 00:21:20,000
Approximately, if we talk about the revenue point of view.

600
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,039
If I tell you honestly, our revenue is around crores, but

601
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:32,358
because there are a lot of investments, like I told you, we

602
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:36,000
have invested in a design agency.

603
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,771
In that, our entire design agency will change, that is, the

604
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:46,998
new products we are building, we have a design agency

605
00:21:46,998 --> 00:21:52,799
outside India, a UK design agency, which basically designs

606
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,000
spaceships.

607
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,276
Together, we are designing a product, which we will launch

608
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:01,912
in April-May, because it takes 8 months to make a

609
00:22:01,912 --> 00:22:06,180
differentiated product. So, all the money we are getting,

610
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,000
it is getting invested in new product development.

611
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,692
So, if you look at the actual profit on paper, then our

612
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:17,472
profit will be almost 0, and we will be in loss, because

613
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:21,414
more money is being invested in the next project. So, from

614
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:25,407
the revenue point of view, we are doing decent, because if

615
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:26,853
I tell you honestly,

616
00:22:26,853 --> 00:22:30,000
we would have to go international.

617
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,829
In India, it is a luxury purchase. Skin is a very luxury

618
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:37,817
purchase, and the market ahead of it is outside India. And

619
00:22:37,817 --> 00:22:41,908
after this, I don't want to buy a small mobile accessory. I

620
00:22:41,908 --> 00:22:46,000
want to take a big jump in the consumer electronics space.

621
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,104
I am not selling a TV, I am not selling a speaker, but I am

622
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:53,743
selling a watch. When it will launch, you will know.

623
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:57,695
Everyone has said no, everyone has said yes, that is, if

624
00:22:57,695 --> 00:23:02,000
nothing is said on one, then it is the same. Let's go ahead.

625
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,485
It can be a watch like this, or it can be a mobile, or it

626
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:09,410
can be a spaceship.

627
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:14,089
What do you say? We are selling cars to go to Mars.

628
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:18,317
Like I have a franchise business of Chole Bhature on the

629
00:23:18,317 --> 00:23:18,769
moon.

630
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:21,890
It's been 8 years, we are selling franchises.

631
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,263
So, I understood, but is the revenue fluctuating? Is it

632
00:23:25,263 --> 00:23:26,000
increasing?

633
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,936
Revenue is constantly increasing. I think when we started,

634
00:23:30,936 --> 00:23:35,481
it was increasing quite well. Because we are not just

635
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:40,261
Techburner, we have done marketing in many other things

636
00:23:40,261 --> 00:23:42,000
besides Techburner.

637
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,500
When I searched, Google ads were running. Ads are running,

638
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,104
then we work with other influencers and do multiple things.

639
00:23:51,104 --> 00:23:55,276
And the community that buys, continues to reach them.

640
00:23:55,276 --> 00:24:00,000
Launches keep happening, so even old customers keep buying.

641
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,198
I think one major reason for a business to be successful,

642
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:06,509
like overlays and layers, is that our customers buy again.

643
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:08,059
We don't have one-time buyers.

644
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:11,779
The person who buys from us once, that is a lifetime waste.

645
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:15,049
Normally, what is the cycle? How many months does a person

646
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:16,740
change their skin on average?

647
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,365
In 6 months, a person usually changes their skin. There are

648
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:23,690
many people who change their skin in 3-4 months. And there

649
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,098
are many people who like to change their skin. Usually, the

650
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:30,375
female customers I have seen, their frequency is more to

651
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,487
change their skin.

652
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:34,000
But our audience is dominantly male.

653
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,531
Are you focusing more on Instagram? No, I am not focusing

654
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:43,167
on Instagram to attract girls. We don't have a major focus

655
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:47,600
on Instagram. It is more on the lines that earlier, the

656
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,100
fashion style that I used to think of, I never visually

657
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,000
output it.

658
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,466
I used to think that people will find it weird that a tech

659
00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:59,651
creator is wearing this kind of clothes. Or why is he

660
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:03,160
engaging in fashion? So, I used to get scared. I talked to

661
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,713
a lot of people and asked them how to do it. So, I used to

662
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,182
think that I don't stop

663
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:11,878
myself. And even this fear, let me tell you, I even have

664
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:13,000
business values.

665
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,232
Earlier, when I used to make YouTube videos, people used to

666
00:25:16,232 --> 00:25:19,041
find it weird that I suddenly started talking about

667
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:22,257
business. Because they don't know that I have done so many

668
00:25:22,257 --> 00:25:25,513
things in the past. It is the same thing on Instagram. Now

669
00:25:25,513 --> 00:25:26,916
people are thinking that

670
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:30,293
I have become a fashion person suddenly. But for 2-3 years,

671
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:33,459
I have been involved in fashion. I have done designs, I

672
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:36,823
have designed clothes, I have done a lot of things. So, it

673
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:39,882
was a constant work in progress. But now people have

674
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:41,000
started to see it.

675
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,306
I think my focus is that for some time, I want to sell only

676
00:25:45,306 --> 00:25:49,447
to boys. I don't want to sell more to girls. Because the

677
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,000
marketer knows that.

678
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,968
Why didn't you sell skins and cases? Because let's see, the

679
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:56,865
audience is the same. The skin audience was small and the

680
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:59,000
same audience could have sold more cases.

681
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,573
In cases, what is the brand of case in India that sells

682
00:26:01,573 --> 00:26:04,301
printed cases well, which is very successful? You will not

683
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:06,955
be able to get it. Usually, the cases that will be there

684
00:26:06,955 --> 00:26:09,690
will only be of iPhone. It will not be that everyone will

685
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,698
be selling. If there

686
00:26:10,698 --> 00:26:13,000
will be, then the iPhone will be selling.

687
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,385
The reason is that the supply chain is very difficult.

688
00:26:17,385 --> 00:26:21,966
There are so many challenges in the supply chain that if

689
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:26,765
you want to sell a good quality case for Rs 300-400, it is

690
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:29,000
a very difficult business.

691
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,860
And you will not make a profit in that. Because I tell you,

692
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:42,312
the case companies that sell so many cases, you have no

693
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:49,000
idea. People have no idea that tons of cases are burned.

694
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,153
This is a very wastage. When I was entering, I thought of a

695
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:57,187
case only. But I realized that it was a good decision for

696
00:26:57,187 --> 00:27:01,251
the environment and everything. Plus, the supply chain is

697
00:27:01,251 --> 00:27:04,937
so difficult that if we enter, we would have made a

698
00:27:04,937 --> 00:27:06,599
business. But in that,

699
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:11,000
I didn't want to get into accessories for a long time.

700
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,113
I liked the skin of the case. And we wouldn't have been

701
00:27:14,113 --> 00:27:17,246
able to add something like this to the case. The supply

702
00:27:17,246 --> 00:27:20,583
chain of the case is difficult for a normal person. But if

703
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:23,000
you put on the whole manufacturing setup.

704
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,629
When an order comes, do we already have the skin ready? I

705
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:32,046
will tell you operationally that I am not so much into

706
00:27:32,046 --> 00:27:36,682
operations. We have hired heads who lead operations. But

707
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:39,000
around 30% remains with us.

708
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,782
And our supply chain is so fast that if we get an order

709
00:27:43,782 --> 00:27:48,690
now, we can ship it by the evening. Everything is packed

710
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,844
and shipped by the evening. But the problem is that we get

711
00:27:53,844 --> 00:27:55,000
more orders.

712
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,328
And how much capacity do we have now? How much can we make

713
00:27:59,328 --> 00:28:03,085
daily? I will have to check. Because now we have 3

714
00:28:03,085 --> 00:28:07,036
machines. I don't know exactly, but we can easily do

715
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:10,000
2000-3000. But I will have to confirm.

716
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,341
I will tell you honestly that I personally don't get into

717
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:16,168
operations. Because I don't have the strength in

718
00:28:16,168 --> 00:28:19,550
operations. For that, I have brought the right people who

719
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,030
know it well. And I think as a business owner, our biggest

720
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,770
skill is that we should know

721
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:28,000
what we don't want to do and what we don't know.

722
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,933
I have made a mistake by doing all this. And I have learned

723
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:35,754
this from experience that I should bring someone else for

724
00:28:35,754 --> 00:28:39,198
what I don't know. I am involved in design, product

725
00:28:39,198 --> 00:28:43,095
development and marketing. I know how to build a product,

726
00:28:43,095 --> 00:28:44,735
what is going on in the

727
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:48,707
market, what is the demand of people, how to design, what

728
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:52,713
screw will be used, what will be the finish, what texture

729
00:28:52,713 --> 00:28:57,000
will come, how to open in packaging, what smell should come.

730
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,740
I am deeply involved in this.

731
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,349
And I am deeply involved in the marketing part.

732
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:04,818
I think, I will tell you honestly, operations is a job that

733
00:29:04,818 --> 00:29:05,700
anyone can do.

734
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,599
There are people in the market who can do it.

735
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:12,022
And why should I do such a job that people in the market

736
00:29:12,022 --> 00:29:13,000
can already do?

737
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,456
But the product development and design is very unique to

738
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:20,071
us. No one else can copy that in the market. So that's why

739
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:23,000
I try to do the same thing that only I can do.

740
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So how did you switch overlays? After skin?

741
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I am not switching, both are working together.

742
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,627
No, I mean, why did you think that I do this too? We have

743
00:29:30,627 --> 00:29:31,779
more alternatives to do.

744
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:34,071
But why did you choose jackets? Did you feel that this

745
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:36,569
business is not being made, a good business can be made in

746
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:37,000
a jacket?

747
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,625
No, no, nothing like that. Layers are running well. Layers

748
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:43,000
are running well. Layers are growing.

749
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,777
But let's see, tan wise, if we talk about making a bigger

750
00:29:46,777 --> 00:29:50,187
business, then we can make a bigger business in the

751
00:29:50,187 --> 00:29:54,000
clothing line versus skin. I will start with this point.

752
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Yes, 100%.

753
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So did you start clothing thinking this?

754
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,160
because we had to do it first.

755
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,207
I'll tell you honestly, we started with overlays before

756
00:30:04,207 --> 00:30:07,507
layers. I mean, actually, in the beginning, we started with

757
00:30:07,507 --> 00:30:10,079
overlays first. We started with layers later.

758
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,801
And in overlays, what happened was, at that time, the entry

759
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:15,199
barrier, as I told you, the entry barrier was huge.

760
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,951
If you want to make high-quality clothes, if you want to

761
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:22,960
make basic clothes, 100% cotton T-shirts, with a little bit

762
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,639
of print.

763
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,799
You can make it, anyone can make it.

764
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,240
There are so many factories.

765
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,258
But if you want to make clothes that beat international

766
00:30:29,258 --> 00:30:32,374
brands, there are only a few factories in India that can

767
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:33,319
make it for you.

768
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:35,079
They have the machines.

769
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:38,506
They have the things that will provide you quality at that

770
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:38,919
level.

771
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,160
That was a big problem to solve.

772
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,599
We have to beat them.

773
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,686
But we don't even have that much money that how do you work

774
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:45,500
in such a big factory?

775
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,039
They take lakhs of orders.

776
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,559
Now we don't even have the budget for lakhs of orders.

777
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,519
It wasn't there at that time.

778
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,880
We were just starting at that time.

779
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,959
Then what did we do?

780
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,079
We decided how to do it.

781
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,799
We won't sell less quality.

782
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,019
We can't start selling less quality

783
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,599
We decided to make our own factory.

784
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,640
We do everything.

785
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,960
We have been running this factory for 2-2.5 years.

786
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,599
We had bought a factory before this.

787
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,160
It was 2-2.5 years old.

788
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,119
We were making it.

789
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,599
We were improving in every launch.

790
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:11,799
Then we bought a big factory.

791
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:15,000
And when we felt that our quality has been set.

792
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,880
This is going to beat any international brand.

793
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,723
We are selling at a price where no international brand can

794
00:31:22,723 --> 00:31:23,319
compete.

795
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:26,160
Then we presented it well to the market.

796
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,680
Till then we didn't do any marketing.

797
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Till then we did a little marketing in launches.

798
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,115
But it reached the masses when we actually made a product

799
00:31:34,115 --> 00:31:36,199
which people knew that we made it.

800
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
And it is of good quality.

801
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,960
And we are selling it at the right price.

802
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,960
So that's why people saw it.

803
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,165
But actually this thing has been going on for 3-3.5 years.

804
00:31:47,165 --> 00:31:51,969
And even now what happens is when we make more videos

805
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:56,319
people think that we have shifted the business.

806
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,279
It's not like that.

807
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,720
Majorly both things are growing together continuously.

808
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,720
And we keep shifting it month by month.

809
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,160
That this month is its launch.

810
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,720
This month is its launch like this.

811
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,000
So it will run continuously.

812
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,279
But yes, as you said

813
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,160
Kinz's market has an upper cap in India.

814
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,086
To expand its cap now as I tell you layers you think its

815
00:32:16,086 --> 00:32:17,980
promotion is not going on.

816
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,720
But its promotion is going on outside India.

817
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,359
We are figuring out how to do it outside India.

818
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,799
So we are growing it more outside India.

819
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,799
And we are figuring out things outside India.

820
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,920
We don't even know about overlays in India.

821
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,240
So in India we are doing it.

822
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,039
So what is everyone's strategy in doing things like this?

823
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,039
See, how technical it is.

824
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,680
I feel that many people understand Shlok.

825
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,480
That's why I wanted to do it with you.

826
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,200
I have been connecting with you for a long time.

827
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,519
Because most people understand Shlok as a YouTuber.

828
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,200
They think he will set fire.

829
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,759
And no one knows how smart he is sitting behind.

830
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,559
Who has thought a lot strategically.

831
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,969
When are the watches coming? I don't want to tell you about

832
00:32:58,969 --> 00:33:00,240
the watches yet.

833
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,519
You will know whether we will do the watches or not.

834
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:10,693
What will be the price segment? Will it be affordable or

835
00:33:10,693 --> 00:33:13,599
super premium? We are figuring it out.

836
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,000
We are working very hard right now.

837
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,319
I want to say this.

838
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,063
And I can only tell you that we are working with the best

839
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:23,640
companies in the world.

840
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:27,707
And we are giving a lot of time to the product we are

841
00:33:27,707 --> 00:33:28,400
building.

842
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,400
Usually the watch market, there are many people who I know.

843
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,232
Even just in general, the consumer electronics market is

844
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:37,839
very quick.

845
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:38,759
People don't know.

846
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,519
The goods come from outside India.

847
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,519
Same to same, it is sold in India.

848
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,240
By putting a brand.

849
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,200
And we are optimizing a little bit here and there.

850
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,945
But no one is working on the design, the whole experience,

851
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,559
the software end to end.

852
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:52,920
I am feeling that way.

853
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,680
And I feel that watches can replace smartphones.

854
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
It has become so powerful.

855
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,240
Because now a lot of things are coming in that space.

856
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,880
So what we will take out will be expensive.

857
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Sustainability is my requirement.

858
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,880
I won't tell you the price.

859
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,599
I have a requirement in the watch.

860
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,599
Put that in.

861
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,599
Then I will start another new startup.

862
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,239
I have decided on my own.

863
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,239
Put a glucometer in the watch.

864
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,719
In China, many people are doing 80-90.

865
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,159
Because let's talk about CJM.

866
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,519
You have also come to fitness.

867
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,000
So you have started understanding biomechanics.

868
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So the CJM that has come nowadays.

869
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,440
Many companies are selling it.

870
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,079
It is 80-90% accurate.

871
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,800
So I was doing some research.

872
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,159
There are some watches coming in China.

873
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,440
It looks like a needle.

874
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,960
It is doing it without a needle.

875
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
It is doing it with sweat.

876
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
And it is doing it in the watch.

877
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Many companies have made it in China.

878
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,960
And it is also doing OEM for others.

879
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,239
If it is 80-90% accurate, just imagine.

880
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,679
I mean, I am telling you.

881
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,079
If the audience will understand, then fine.

882
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,239
If not, then do it further.

883
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,599
Normally I wear a watch.

884
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,000
My walk is being monitored.

885
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,199
If I give it my data, my fat, my height, etc.

886
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,960
Then it might be able to monitor my calories too.

887
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,960
Now it is able to monitor my heart rate too.

888
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,360
Now if it starts monitoring my glucose level too.

889
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,359
Then what will happen?

890
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,320
As soon as I eat, it will ask me, Have you eaten anything?

891
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,039
Because it saw that my spike has come.

892
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,519
I will say yes.

893
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,679
Now it will ask, what have you eaten?

894
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,679
I will tell it a little.

895
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,920
Based on that, it will calculate its calories.

896
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,000
Now it will tell me.

897
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,559
It will get to know after some time.

898
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,559
Because AI is coming here.

899
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,279
It will get to know from time

900
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,155
How do my fat burn go to my body? When I wore CGM, I took a

901
00:35:27,155 --> 00:35:28,559
one month trial.

902
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,559
I mean, I wore it for a month.

903
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:32,553
So I got to know that fat burns are well absorbed on my

904
00:35:32,553 --> 00:35:32,880
body.

905
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,559
Normally it is bad for people.

906
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:35,880
But it is not so bad for me.

907
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,880
My body behaves well with fat burns.

908
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,778
Similarly, if I wear a watch, then this data will start

909
00:35:40,778 --> 00:35:41,199
coming.

910
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:43,000
If someone is under stress,

911
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,719
Then how are fat burns affecting his body?

912
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:48,320
Just imagine how big a data set can be made.

913
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,839
I mean, my idea is

914
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Because I don't want to get into hardware.

915
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,119
I am a marketer, a software guy.

916
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,639
So I don't want to get into hardware.

917
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,920
If someone makes it,

918
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,920
I mean, I have investors ready.

919
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,559
That we will make such a product

920
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:07,039
Which is end to end.

921
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,039
What is happening logically?

922
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,480
We are going to the doctor.

923
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
There are many types of practical apps made these days.

924
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
We are going to the doctor.

925
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,599
After that, we have shared all the data of my watch.

926
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,579
So he is getting to know

927
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:19,190
At what time did my glucose fluctuate?

928
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:21,679
At what time did my heart rate fluctuate?

929
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,340
What is my resting heart rate?

930
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,039
What is my walking heart rate?

931
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:27,599
Based on that, he has done my full analysis.

932
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,000
Now if my watch feels

933
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
That if someone's resting goes so much

934
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,719
And he is eating this type of food

935
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,199
And this is happening because of it.

936
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,000
So maybe his cholesterol can be high.

937
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,760
So by default, my app will tell me

938
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,000
Get a cholesterol test done.

939
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,800
I did it.

940
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
We filled the data.

941
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
My one more data was added to my watch.

942
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
He got one more learning.

943
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,762
At this much cholesterol, this person's heart rate remains

944
00:36:49,762 --> 00:36:50,400
this much.

945
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
And the food is absorbed like this.

946
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
I mean, there can be a fire in this thing.

947
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,000
I mean, what we call smart watch revolution.

948
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I think this can be a fitness band revolution.

949
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,199
If anyone is watching, tell me.

950
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,199
I mean, I am saying, if you want to go ahead, go ahead.

951
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,599
I think it is 100%.

952
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:09,400
Because I have also tried those CGN monitors.

953
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,000
And it is very good and useful.

954
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,599
Even I am very much involved in health.

955
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,199
That I have taken so many things in health.

956
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:20,000
Now, for example, I did a mattress by sleeping on it.

957
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,199
I also found that very interesting.

958
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,599
I mean, it is hot and cold.

959
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:23,400
There are so many things.

960
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,199
I am also taking a lot of supplements.

961
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,800
I am figuring out a lot of things.

962
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,199
And in the watch, I feel like The problem I am seeing

963
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:32,799
If I tell you honestly

964
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,000
I see this problem

965
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,800
This is definitely a good feature.

966
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,199
According to me, the basics are not being done right now.

967
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:41,000
I think the first thing should be

968
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,800
A standard good user interface.

969
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,800
And all the things that are working accurately.

970
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,599
So, our focus is very different right now.

971
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:53,599
Because we are not using all these features in this segment.

972
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,400
We will not use it in the Apple segment.

973
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,399
So, according to me,

974
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,939
The demand of the current user The price point at which we

975
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:03,799
want to go

976
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,800
We want to meet it very well.

977
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,799
And if we make a fitness product

978
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,000
Then I will not make it in 3 months.

979
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,400
I will make it in 3 years.

980
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,399
And I will make such a product That after wearing that band

981
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,599
You don't have to do anything else.

982
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:21,000
Because I don't believe in half-hearted things.

983
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
That you are getting a sensor.

984
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Let's put it on and do it.

985
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
There were a lot of things like this.

986
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,599
We also made a smart ring prototype.

987
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,400
We figured out how it happens in smart rings.

988
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,599
All the watches were in smart rings.

989
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,800
After that, we tried different prototypes.

990
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,799
And I can tell you that

991
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
Like you are telling one sensor.

992
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
There are blind sensors.

993
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,400
There are 10 things in the market.

994
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,199
But I

995
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:40,199
I focus on the experience and go to work.

996
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,199
And according to me

997
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:46,018
If I am aiming for a category Then I have to be number one

998
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:46,599
in it.

999
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,769
If I am entering the Apple race

1000
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,599
Then my goal would not be that

1001
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,400
Apple takes this much market.

1002
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,599
It sells for 30,000 rupees.

1003
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,599
Takes this much market.

1004
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,599
I take out 25,000.

1005
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,599
Put one or two extra features in a little less feature.

1006
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:00,599
I don't go from that perspective.

1007
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,579
If I am entering a market Then I will make sure that

1008
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,000
We make the best product in that market.

1009
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,199
Our product should be the best in the world.

1010
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:10,199
And then we sell it at a premium.

1011
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:12,000
That is my philosophy.

1012
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
If I can't beat Apple

1013
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,599
Then I won't enter the Apple race.

1014
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,800
I will enter the product in 3-4 years.

1015
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,400
Where I have done a lot of research with health experts.

1016
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,599
Then I will go there and eat this.

1017
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,400
You don't even have to tell

1018
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
The watch will tell you

1019
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,199
Eat this in the morning.

1020
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:31,199
You will be healthy.

1021
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,199
So health is a priority.

1022
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,777
I will definitely do something in health in the next few

1023
00:39:37,777 --> 00:39:38,199
years.

1024
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,400
But for me

1025
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,199
Because people have no idea.

1026
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:42,199
Because what happens now

1027
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,400
I will tell you the biggest problem.

1028
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,000
We all are sick.

1029
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,800
We don't know.

1030
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,599
All the people in Delhi are sick.

1031
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,000
Everyone has no idea that they are sick.

1032
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,980
The thing that you can't measure

1033
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,599
You don't know how sick you are.

1034
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,800
You have been sick since childhood.

1035
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,000
So you don't know that you are sick.

1036
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,800
You don't know what being healthy is.

1037
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,780
The thing that people can't measure

1038
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,476
If I tell you I'll tell you a number, if you are this much

1039
00:40:03,476 --> 00:40:07,893
sick and you can be this much healthier, then you will

1040
00:40:07,893 --> 00:40:09,119
improve a lot.

1041
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,682
So I also feel that we take health for granted, we don't

1042
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:14,400
even know what is healthy.

1043
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,833
And if you go to the side of Japan, Okinawa and all these

1044
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:21,041
blue zones, there are areas all over the world, there

1045
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:24,576
people live 100 years comfortably, and they don't live 100

1046
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:28,215
years, they are trekking at the age of 90, they have abs at

1047
00:40:28,215 --> 00:40:29,819
the age of 70, naturally,

1048
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:33,089
good strong physique at the age of 70, their diet and

1049
00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:36,499
everything is good, lifestyle diet, a lot of things are

1050
00:40:36,499 --> 00:40:40,183
good, so essentially you live 3 lives in one life, I see it

1051
00:40:40,183 --> 00:40:43,657
like that too, so I think that technology is coming, it

1052
00:40:43,657 --> 00:40:45,490
will come slowly but it will

1053
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:49,822
be very interesting, the watch will also play a part in it,

1054
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:53,420
especially wearables will play a big part in it.

1055
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,125
I have a lot of watches, but since I bought this, I have

1056
00:40:57,125 --> 00:41:00,961
been wearing this only, everything gets tracked somewhere,

1057
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:04,892
the phone also comes here, a lot of other things come here,

1058
00:41:04,892 --> 00:41:08,806
so I feel that wearable is next level thing, it excites me

1059
00:41:08,806 --> 00:41:10,088
a lot, and all the

1060
00:41:10,088 --> 00:41:14,092
best, then I have told you, this is smart questioning, now

1061
00:41:14,092 --> 00:41:18,069
say it like this, stop it, we will tell you in the intro.

1062
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:20,719
Please cut this part, it is not good.

1063
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:23,917
Thank you, I got to learn a lot personally, and I think the

1064
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:25,760
audience also got to learn a lot.

1065
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,215
100%, I also had a lot of fun talking to you, knowing

1066
00:41:29,215 --> 00:41:32,754
everything, even the conversation before the camera, I

1067
00:41:32,754 --> 00:41:36,450
found it very interesting, and I hope the things you are

1068
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:40,255
doing, the users, the consumers, they also got some help,

1069
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:42,192
but yes, definitely a lot of

1070
00:41:42,192 --> 00:41:42,719
fun.

1071
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:44,559
Thank you so much for coming, thank you.

1072
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:46,731
So with this, this video ends here, I hope you enjoyed it,

1073
00:41:46,731 --> 00:41:48,801
like it, share it, tell me in the comments, how did you

like the video, bye, good day, good night, good morning,

00:41:50,924 --> 00:41:53,113
good afternoon, whenever you are watching this video, Jai

1076
00:41:53,113 --> 00:41:53,920
Hind, Vande Mataram.
