1
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,720
Come, dear.

2
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,800
Dear, do you want
to ask anything to him?

3
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,560
Once my parents are okay with him

4
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,640
then there is nothing to talk.

5
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,760
Why are you wearing this attire?

6
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,800
Where is the sari?
Where are the jewelleries?

7
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,320
You dreamt it again?
You don't have any other work?

8
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,240
If you marry and have children

9
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,880
then why will I dream of it.

10
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,520
Will I get any chance in this life
of having a function in this house?

11
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,160
God knows.

12
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,040
You can think of that later.

13
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,840
First prepare my tiffin.

14
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,600
Good morning, Daddy. - Morning.

15
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,760
What's the news? - Same old thing.

16
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,440
Crime here and scam there. - Lunch.

17
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,640
Take it. - Nothing will change.

18
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,000
First think about
marrying your daughter

19
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,760
then you can think
about the whole world.

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,680
She started early in the morning.
- She didn't even stop.

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,280
She was even dreaming of it.

22
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,320
Bye, daddy. - Bye.

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,600
Just wave your hand
and send her to office.

24
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
Don't you think, you should
be sending her to in-laws house.

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,320
Yes, Mr. Sachin. Please wait.

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,080
I am leaving. I am on the way.

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,840
It's Sachin.

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,960
Bhumi. You go to the
supermarket lane, right?

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,840
Yes. - Drop me there.

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,640
No, I won't drop you.
- Why? Even the car is empty.

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,520
This is not a share
auto to drop everybody

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,000
when it's empty.

33
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,720
Tada!

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,480
What's going on?

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,600
Photo session.

36
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,680
For followers.

37
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,720
#MondayMotivation

38
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,040
If they see you
early in the morning,

39
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,920
how will they get motivated?

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,120
Madam. - Not you,

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,400
those who invented the
front camera should be punished.

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,120
I can't punish him so,

43
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,080
from tomorrow I will ban
cell phones inside the office.

44
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,400
Hi, ma'am. I made a beautiful plan

45
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,360
for the factory/warehouse/office.

46
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,120
You will love it. Check it out.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,240
It's so nice, right?

48
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,880
Yes, it is. - Thank you.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,480
Use it for your house.

50
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,960
Sorry, ma'am.
- This is not your hostel

51
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,920
that you can come at anytime.
It's an office.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,040
I am just 10 minutes late, ma'am.
- 10 minutes?

53
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Leaving holidays,
your working days are 280.

54
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,800
If you are late for
10 minutes everyday,

55
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,800
then you are late for
2800 minutes for a year.

56
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,040
That means, it's nearly 47 hours.

57
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,040
If one working day is of 9 hours,
then it is roughly 5 days.

58
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,400
So, calculate your
pay minus 5 days loss.

59
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,560
Oh, God! Whoever marries her...

60
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,560
Yes, whoever marries me...

61
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,560
Did I say it out loud?
- Bring that phone here.

62
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,000
Bring it here.

63
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,520
I want this month's sales
report on my table by evening.

64
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,440
Ma'am. - Bring me the report

65
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,680
and take your phone back.

66
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,760
Uncle! Good morning. Please come.

67
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,600
Hi, morning.
Sit, sit. - Please come in.

68
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,800
So, this is the project idea,
uncle. - Nice.

69
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,000
And this concept is pretty good.
- I really liked that too.

70
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,880
Yeah.

71
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,960
Why do you scare them so much?

72
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,640
They don't have
much responsibilities,

73
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,880
at least they should be afraid.

74
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,520
I am afraid that you will scold me,
forgetting that I am MD.

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,520
Not at all.

76
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,760
So, what's up?
What is your mom saying.

77
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,480
Same old thing.
She is going out to meet them

78
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,480
because I am scolding her
if she brings anyone at home.

79
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,480
Why don't you adjust
yourself because of her, then?

80
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,120
If I want to stay
together for lifetime,

81
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,400
first I should connect to him.

82
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,200
I hope you find your
connection very soon.

83
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,320
Hi. - Hi.

84
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,200
You told me to come urgently
from Paris. What's the matter?

85
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,000
I want to go to India.

86
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,760
Why do you want to go there?
- You know,

87
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,680
wherever you look, you just
see black coats and white beards.

88
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,320
Even if you come out, you
just see tall buildings and cars.

89
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,280
It's been so many days,

90
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,640
I am missing those trees,
fields and traditional attires.

91
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,040
Now, what do you say?

92
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,720
You were saying, there's
some project in India, right? - Yes.

93
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,440
Tell them,
we are ready to take the project.

94
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,280
I need a break from here.

95
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,800
You are thinking about taking break?

96
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,120
Hi, sir.
- Let me break some news to you.

97
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,160
Have a seat, sir.

98
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,640
Thank you.

99
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,560
When I saw you on the dais

100
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,640
you looked like upcoming
billionaire. When I see you here,

101
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,440
you look like a college student.

102
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,560
Okay, I will come to the point.

103
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,720
Sure, sir. - I will give you a deal

104
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,840
which will increase your
bank balance to 200 crores.

105
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,040
200 crores?

106
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,880
If you are okay, I will
make the papers ready by tomorrow.

107
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,080
Thank you.

108
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,600
But no thanks, sir.
I am not interested.

109
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,240
Did you listen the numbers
correctly? It's 200 crores.

110
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,320
After 2, there are nine zeroes.

111
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,480
I already told you,
I am not interested.

112
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
I thought, you only looked
like a college student.

113
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,600
Even your thinking is the same.

114
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,640
I know, money is very necessary.

115
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,120
But that is not the only
thing that is necessary.

116
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,720
Nice meeting you.

117
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,400
Hey, 200 crores?

118
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,600
I am just speechless
after telling that.

119
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,440
How can you reject that so simply.

120
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,800
You forget about that 200 crores

121
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
and get two tickets to India.

122
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,840
What Madam, didn't you
like the guy you met that day?

123
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,880
No.

124
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,920
The boy said okay
after seeing the photo

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,640
but my daughter said no
without even seeing the photo.

126
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,840
Leave it, Madam.
He was a bit average.

127
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,680
Was he? - Yes.

128
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,880
Just see this once.
- Shall I tell the truth?

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,480
That last guy was better.
- Shut up.

130
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,040
You will tell
something to everybody.

131
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,400
Shall I bring you coffee?

132
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,080
Go, bring it. - Okay.

133
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,480
If I won't purchase anything you
people will tell me not to sit here.

134
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,920
You are good looking
in person than the photo.

135
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,320
Whom are you searching?

136
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,800
Are you waiting for somebody?
- Where is your daughter?

137
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,880
She won't come.
- Oh, she won't like coffee?

138
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,440
She won't like the concept
of this kind of meetings.

139
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,120
Then, why did you call me?
- Talk to me, son.

140
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,840
If I like you,
then I will talk to her.

141
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,440
I thought, meeting in the
coffee shop is like a new trend.

142
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,960
People will be open minded.
But, she is not even present here.

143
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,040
I can imagine,
how my future will be with her.

144
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,800
Son...

145
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,920
Hi, Daddy. - Hey.

146
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,400
Why is this house so silent.
Where is Prabhavati?

147
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,520
She is not here.

148
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,240
She went to the temple.

149
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh, she is not back yet? - No.

150
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,960
She went to circumambulate
700 times for your wedding.

151
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
She went to pray to God.

152
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,800
Hail Lord Venkatesh.
- I am not so sure.

153
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,400
Oh, she is already here.

154
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,600
Give me that phone. I will call her.

155
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,360
Where will she go?
She will be back soon.

156
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,720
There she is.

157
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,440
Oh, God.

158
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,040
Oh!

159
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,920
You look tired.

160
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,920
Oh, God.

161
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,640
My legs are paining. - Oh, God.

162
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,880
I am tired.

163
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,840
Where did you go? - Can't you see.

164
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,520
I went to Venkateshwara temple.
Take the offering.

165
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,960
New sari,
offering, flowers, leg pains.

166
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,440
You are managing it all very nicely.

167
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,560
But, if someone goes to
temple they will crush the coconut

168
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,240
not bring the coconut to the house.

169
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,280
Won't you change? - I won't change.

170
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,880
Mom, marriages won't
happen like this.

171
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,080
Then tell me, how marriages happen?
I will do it like that.

172
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,400
Just making me sit like a doll,

173
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,800
or scanning me if
I they like me or not.

174
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,080
I can't do those.

175
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Who rejected you?

176
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,160
You are only rejecting them, saying
you are not connecting with them.

177
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,320
Should I connect with
whoever you show me?

178
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,640
If you want to connect with
somebody, you should see him first.

179
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,560
Women of your age are having
babies and sending them to school.

180
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,520
And here I am, searching
a husband for you like a mad woman.

181
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,480
I am very unlucky.

182
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,240
I can't tolerate all this.

183
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,520
Will you say something...
- Sachin.

184
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,880
Satyam.

185
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,480
Hello, Satyam.

186
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
Good morning, ma'am.

187
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,280
Ma'am, after thinking
deeply I made another design.

188
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,240
If you see this,
your mind will be blown. Trust me.

189
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,680
How much will you take?

190
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Thank you.
I know, you will like this for sure.

191
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,440
Also, I am comfortable
for any negotiations between us.

192
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,600
Just give me whatever you like.
- Not for this design.

193
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,600
I asked as you had to do it again.

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,560
Thank you, ma'am. Sarla,
please think about your likes.

195
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,320
Please, don't say
anything about my sketch.

196
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,720
We are about to start
a new manufacturing unit.

197
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,920
Once we start it, I will inform you.
You can visit that day.

198
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,280
Madam.

199
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,800
What are you seeing? - Madam.

200
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,000
Give me the phone. Give me.

201
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,840
Here!

202
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
What is this?

203
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,640
I try to hide it inside, ma'am.

204
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,360
But, it comes out bursting.

205
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,520
What is that? - Talent, ma'am.

206
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,920
Next time, if I see something
like this you will loose.

207
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,720
What will I loose, ma'am?
- Your job.

208
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,720
Monster.

209
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,560
Why did you shout at that architect?

210
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,400
Our company's concept and the
design he made is totally different.

211
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,000
He should've at least
used his common sense.

212
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,760
Correct,
but don't be too strict, Bhumi.

213
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,280
Even our office staff
is afraid of you.

214
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,560
No student likes
to go to school, uncle.

215
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,360
Everybody just wants to play.

216
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,680
But, when they study
their future will be bright.

217
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,080
I am not talking about them.

218
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,040
You are being too
strict for yourself.

219
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,160
When I was not strict,
nobody took me serious.

220
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,400
Now, when I am being strict

221
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,120
nobody wants me to be with them.

222
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,880
If I tell you the truth

223
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,280
I don't even remember,
how I was back then.

224
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,520
I don't even know, how should I be.

225
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,000
Hello, Akash.
- Hello, Uncle, How are you?

226
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
I am good.

227
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,920
How was your travelling?

228
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,120
Gautam said, you are coming here.

229
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,120
If you are free tomorrow, I will
come and meet you in the office.

230
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,040
You are not some outsider.
Come home.

231
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
Sure, uncle.

232
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,760
Do you know how he is?
- Yeah, I know.

233
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,400
Hey, you said you wanted
to see sari and skirt.

234
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,640
Here, size of buildings
are increasing

235
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,640
and size of clothes are decreasing.
- Stop it.

236
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,840
This is the problem with you.

237
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,760
You don't see them and
you won't allow us to see.

238
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,480
Hi, uncle. - Hi, Akash.

239
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,400
You reminded me of my son,
I am so happy that you came.

240
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,960
Do you remember him? Akash.

241
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,880
Hi, aunty. - How are you, son.

242
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,520
Yes, I am good. - How is my son.

243
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,760
He is fine, aunty.

244
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,400
Tell him to come and meet us

245
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,520
at least once a year.

246
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,920
Okay, I'll bring you some coffee.
- Okay, aunty.

247
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,240
I saw your interview on CNN.

248
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,880
I felt very proud. - Thanks, uncle.

249
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,480
You will leave early or
will you be here for some days?

250
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,040
Actually,
I have some important work here.

251
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,320
Okay. - Yes, uncle.

252
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,320
Come Bhumi.

253
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,760
Why did you stop there?

254
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,000
He is Akash.

255
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,800
He is a friend of Gautam. - Hi.

256
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,360
She is... - Bhumi.

257
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,640
You people know each other? - Yes.

258
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,800
Yes, uncle. We were in
same batch in the college.

259
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,800
Oh...

260
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,600
One minute.
You guys sit down. - Okay, uncle.

261
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,960
I will be right back. Hello.

262
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,160
It's been many days, right? - Yes.

263
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,040
You look very different.

264
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,040
What are you doing now?
- Nothing, just small business.

265
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,400
You? - Akash.

266
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,680
You said something about a project.
Did it started?

267
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,960
It's almost getting started. - Okay.

268
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,520
Bhumi, you know he
is very famous architect.

269
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,640
Oh!

270
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,000
I just remembered.

271
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,480
We have a small project.
If you are free

272
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,680
just look at it once...
- We don't need

273
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,080
so big architect, uncle.

274
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,680
You are afraid, he will charge more?

275
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,200
Bhumi is afraid that
it will be out of budget.

276
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,600
Nothing like that, uncle.

277
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,880
One second.

278
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Hello.

279
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,480
You are informing me now
that raw materials didn't arrive.

280
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,120
If you can't do the work.
Go home. Bloody morons.

281
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,600
Need to go, uncle. Sorry. -Okay.

282
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,120
Bye, Akash. - Bye.

283
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,720
What happen, Akash?
Are you confused?

284
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,640
She might be a bit angry,
but she has a very good heart.

285
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,640
Hi, ma'am. How can I help you?

286
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,120
Please give me some time.

287
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,360
Hey, what are you doing here?

288
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,280
I should ask that. I stay here.

289
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,320
I came here for a business deal.

290
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,320
Oh, okay.
I will accompany you till then.

291
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,200
You know what.

292
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,600
You are in sari when everyone
around you are in middies and jeans.

293
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,640
You know,
you are very beautiful in sari.

294
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,400
Don't make silly compliments
like a college student.

295
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,960
There is nothing wrong giving
complements. Age doesn't matter.

296
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,400
But seriously,
you look so beautiful in sari.

297
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Did you do any course in flirting?

298
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,320
Hey, I am telling you the
fact and you think I am flirting.

299
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,320
I don't like all these.

300
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,400
If you are this beautiful
then you can't miss all these.

301
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,400
What's up? How's business going?

302
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,960
Yeah, fine. - Great.

303
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,680
Uncle said something
about a project.

304
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Do you want me to look into that?

305
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,320
No, no. Not necessary.
It's a small project.

306
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,600
Hey, don't worry. I'll help you out.

307
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,480
No need Akash. It's not your range.

308
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,200
Okay, I'll leave now. What?

309
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,240
You are here to meet someone, right?

310
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,080
How can I do business
those who don't respect time?

311
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,240
In business people go
through finances, not time.

312
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,400
Money is necessary.
Just money is not necessary.

313
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,920
Bye.

314
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,640
She is interesting now.

315
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,840
Why didn't I knew it then?

316
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,320
I didn't observe her before?

317
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,120
Or I never knew about it.
- Hey, is that you, Akash.

318
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,600
Many girls have proposed you.
Did you even care for anyone?

319
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,080
She is new and different.

320
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
So, I must closely observe her.

321
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,440
For that, you must go nearer to her.

322
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,160
Yes, I know a way to do that. - Oh!

323
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,720
Whom are you calling?

324
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,040
He will take me closer to her.

325
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,800
Hello, Akash. - Hi, uncle.

326
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,160
Hi, Bhumi. He's Raghu.

327
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,880
He is my friend/PA. - Hello.

328
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,840
Hi.

329
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,240
So, you are doing our project then?

330
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,400
Yeah. Mr. Bhupati asked
me and I can't say no to him.

331
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,080
He said, you called
him and you want to do it.

332
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,400
Oh, that's what he said?

333
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,800
That's how you did.

334
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,080
I told you, this is a small project.
- I will do it.

335
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,120
I don't like everything that easily.
Later, you will only be in trouble.

336
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,400
What? There's no chance
you won't like it.

337
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,840
This is not a big matter to him.

338
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,800
He makes it look very simple.

339
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,600
Let's see.

340
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,640
Sir, tea.

341
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
Sir.

342
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,640
Sorry. Sorry, ma'am. - Idiot.

343
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,240
Can't you see? - Sorry, ma'am.

344
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,960
Clean it. - Okay, ma'am.

345
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,400
Hey, you said she is interesting.
She is totally different.

346
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,120
Don't judge her.

347
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,800
Hey, she is not your range, Akash.
She is not your match.

348
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,000
If you want to be near to home,
you must decrease your imagination.

349
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,240
Okay.

350
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,480
Kishore, come to my cabin.

351
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,960
This is our site layout.

352
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,480
May I come in, ma'am? - Yes.

353
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,760
He's Akash, architect from Paris.

354
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,680
This is Kishore.

355
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,120
If you have any doubts,
he'll clear it. - Sure.

356
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,720
Hello.

357
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,640
For just a small sketch,
you came from Paris.

358
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,760
Do you think,
we don't know how to sketch?

359
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,080
You are hear to clarify our doubts.
Not your doubts.

360
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,680
Wow. You are so handsome.

361
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,760
One selfie, please. - Sure.

362
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,440
Selfie Sarla?

363
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,600
Do you know me?

364
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,880
Your tiktok videos are
so famous even in Paris.

365
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,280
They removed Tiktok and
kicked talented people like me.

366
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,240
Thank God. - You guys just gossip

367
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,680
or do any work?

368
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,200
She saw her while saying
it but I think, that was for us.

369
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,360
Do you doubt that?

370
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,240
Where is the site?
What is the plot size?

371
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,680
What are GHMC norms?

372
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,760
Who is present at the site?
How much paper work is done?

373
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,560
If I get the details
what I just asked in two days.

374
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,760
We will start the work.

375
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,840
Let's go. - Two days.

376
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,240
Sarla, come with the sales register.

377
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,200
Why is she telling
me to bring the selfie?

378
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,160
She didn't say selfie.

379
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,480
She told you to come
with the sales register.

380
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
There are many unique people's here.

381
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,280
Hey, you are in India
but you won't come home?

382
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,960
I will come.
I just have a small work.

383
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,120
When it's finished I'll be there.

384
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,880
It's been two years
since you were home.

385
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,080
I just look at you
in the mobile screen.

386
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,680
Hey, someone catch him.

387
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,480
Hey, hey.

388
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,720
Oye.

389
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,680
I will call you again, mom. - Hey.

390
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,600
Wait.

391
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,480
Hey.

392
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,760
Thank you, son.

393
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,040
It's okay. Just check whether
everything is there or not?

394
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,560
I came to the cafe to
meet a guy for my daughter.

395
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,520
When I came out, he stole the bag.

396
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,000
You are meeting a guy for
your daughter in a cafe? - Yes.

397
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,200
Please tell me more
details about it.

398
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,280
It seems little different.

399
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,120
Yes, I know. - You must be careful.

400
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,920
What if something happens to you?

401
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,480
Nothing happened to me.

402
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,560
You were here to help
me in the correct time.

403
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,520
Okay, I'll leave now.

404
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,640
I will drop you. - No.

405
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,320
No need. I will go in the auto.

406
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,440
Okay.

407
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,760
Auto.

408
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,160
Will you drop me
to Jubilee Hills? - Yes.

409
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,720
Bye, son. - Bye, madam.

410
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,120
This is our proposed
site in Shad Nagar, sir.

411
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,240
If we stay here,
even if we are so talented

412
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,280
they will see us as
locals and as a cheap.

413
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,120
If you come from abroad,

414
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,520
they are imported and
they will be respected more.

415
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,160
Don't feel bad, Kishore. Thank you.

416
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,240
If you come from Paris or Parel,
you will be the same.

417
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,760
#joke

418
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,280
They are NRI's so, #moz.

419
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,600
No issues, sir. - Inform Bhumi also.

420
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,480
I already informed her.

421
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,200
She said to tell you.

422
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,160
Brother. Genuine question.

423
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,000
Is he understanding anything
or is he just acting?

424
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,120
Bring another one.
- One second, sir.

425
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,400
Bindu. Marker. - Okay.

426
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,080
She is bringing.
- Bring an imported marker.

427
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,520
Do you like her?

428
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,600
She worked hard to give him that,
that means, she likes him too.

429
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,400
Excuse me, sir.

430
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,840
Follow.

431
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,720
Their love story is so complicated.

432
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,800
Like in films, this girl
comes from a poor background.

433
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,280
And the boy's family is very rich.

434
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,280
This whole complicated love story

435
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,800
is directed by our big man.

436
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,720
Who? Mr. Bhupati?

437
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,240
Yes. There he is.
Speak of the devil.

438
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,880
He will definitely hit a century.

439
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,240
Now see,
she will go and talk to him.

440
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,120
Hi, sir. How are you?
- He will reply her casually.

441
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,880
She will laugh,
as if he said a big joke.

442
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,040
Okay, okay.

443
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,360
But, there's no big joke in there.

444
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,200
He pays her, that's why.
Whatever he says, she will laugh.

445
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,160
This recipe is only
known to Indian people.

446
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,400
Then, why don't you do it?

447
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,360
I tried,

448
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,400
but I never understand,
when to laugh or when not to.

449
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,560
When I try to laugh,
he will leave till that time.

450
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,560
Did you get it?
Even this small thing is an art.

451
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Please, don't judge an artist.

452
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,920
Oh, God!

453
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,040
When are you going to see the site?

454
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,000
We were just leaving. - Good.

455
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,920
Kishore. - Ma'am.

456
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,240
Show them the site. - Ma'am.

457
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,280
You also go, Bhumi.

458
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,720
Uncle, if I go then who
will take care of the office?

459
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,320
This is not a border of India.

460
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,640
Nobody will come and destroy
if you are not here for sometime.

461
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,040
Superb. Good one, sir.
Good one. Superb.

462
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,200
Oh. He is more bigger
artist than everybody here.

463
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
We'll go in my car.

464
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,760
There's no problem going
in their respective cars.

465
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,560
I don't know the address.

466
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,920
Kishore. - Ma'am.

467
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,320
You come with him. - Yes, ma'am.

468
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,480
Brother, looks like
your madam is too strict.

469
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,840
Just be frank about it.

470
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,960
She is always angry.

471
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,680
If there was any
premier league in anger,

472
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
in every season she
would've been the winner.

473
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,440
I think she is not married yet.
- Who will marry a girl like her.

474
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,400
We can adjust if
woman are not beautiful

475
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,720
but we can't if they are angry.

476
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,280
Bhumi.

477
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,960
Nice sari. - Let's look at the site.

478
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,840
Nice sari?

479
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,200
Your boss is trying

480
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,360
to make an ice in the desert.

481
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,400
Yes.

482
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,720
Hello.

483
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,640
Bhumi, what's this eco friendly?

484
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,120
You alone will change the world?

485
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,840
Why? Do you have any problem?

486
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,200
Ah! No.

487
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,080
Why so serious? I am just kidding.

488
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,960
Men and architects
are born to be rejected.

489
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,920
Did you see any batsmen who can
hit sixes every ball. There he is.

490
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,840
Did you see any umpire who
gives no-ball for every delivery.

491
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,160
There she is.

492
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,480
Mom, what did you
prepare for breakfast?

493
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,840
What was that suppose to mean?
What happen to your mouth?

494
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,160
She vowed that she won't talk.

495
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,120
Vow of silence? But why?

496
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,280
My mom just talks about my marks

497
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,760
and your mom just talks
about your marriage. Right?

498
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,840
If she vows, will I be married?

499
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,000
My mom is praying for my marks,
but am I getting it?

500
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,800
Leave them, it's their belief.

501
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,960
Okay, tell them to do this everyday.

502
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,320
We will have some peace of mind.

503
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,160
But I won't make
my mom suffer like you.

504
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,640
Whoever gives me the first
love letter I will marry him.

505
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,280
First stop wetting the bed,
then think about marrying.

506
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,400
Who are these guys?
- Boys keep photos of heroines

507
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,280
and your house is
filled with boys' photos.

508
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,560
Who is this guy? Look so good.

509
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,960
Let me see. - Really!!

510
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,840
Let me see. - Let me see.

511
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,520
Did you like him?
Should I talk to them?

512
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,400
What about your vow of silence?

513
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,360
Don't act those vows
and homage in front of me.

514
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,920
Bhumi, it's cheating.

515
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,600
What happened? Who is cheating.

516
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
Yes. - What happened?

517
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,880
She broke Prabhavati's vow.

518
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,880
Monster. - Hey.

519
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,120
What is this? - That's
Sreedhar's daughter's marriage

520
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,600
who stays in house number 12.

521
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,480
During her function

522
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,880
you made a plait of it.

523
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,400
That is an invitation card.
Don't cry while reading.

524
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,280
What is left except
crying in my life?

525
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,440
If you are so sad,
then don't go to the marriage.

526
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,880
Don't link everything
to my marriage.

527
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,200
When people ask me
about your marriage,

528
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,800
I am just speechless, and
I even stopped going to marriages.

529
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,240
Hey, did you just born
me only for marriage?

530
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,040
Why are you hiding
as if it is a crime.

531
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,760
You broke my vow and made me speak.

532
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,600
Also go and shut their mouths.

533
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,600
Hey, do breakfast...

534
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,240
Are you satisfied?

535
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,880
Even in AC you are making me sweat.

536
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,560
Tell me what you
are here for? - Yes.

537
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,880
What is today's date?
- You came here to ask that?

538
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,840
You told you will
deliver my order on 18th.

539
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,720
Today is 19th.

540
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,480
There is no stock nor any
phone call that it will be late.

541
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,400
Then, how can this continue?

542
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,560
Kartik. Come to my cabin.

543
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,040
You guys didn't deliver him yet?

544
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,720
Production has been delayed, ma'am.
It's only been completed 70%.

545
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,280
Why didn't you inform them?
How can you be so irresponsible?

546
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,920
What's the matter?
- Let's do one thing.

547
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,560
Like old ways,

548
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,120
I have materials which
are ready to be delivered.

549
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,560
I will sell it to you.

550
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,560
If you use it and
mix it with your material

551
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,120
we can earn much more.

552
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,200
I won't use such cheap
materials for our work.

553
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,520
Oh, you got angry.

554
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,800
Your madam didn't read
the agreement properly, I guess.

555
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,240
If you don't deliver the
material in the mentioned date,

556
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,920
you will need to pay back double.

557
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,480
I am doing what I like.

558
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,800
I won't leave it,
even if I have to bear some losses.

559
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,520
Check the background before
accepting the deal from next time.

560
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,680
If you think, they are
not appropriate throw them out.

561
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,760
If you want to impress
this kind of girl

562
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,920
you must be with them for some time.

563
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,960
Ma'am, raw material file.

564
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,160
Is the plan ready?

565
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,440
It's being ready.
- Why are you taking so long?

566
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,960
You won't like anything
very easily, right?

567
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,760
I must think out of box.

568
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,200
Actually, out of the galaxy...

569
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,760
What brother? Did he make it?

570
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,440
No, brother.

571
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,560
I would've been
done ten times by now.

572
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,920
Shaving your beard? - Sketch.

573
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,680
There is a difference

574
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,560
between LKG student's
drawing and Engineer's drawing.

575
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,600
Akash. - Tell me, Sarla.

576
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,680
I made a new video.
Do you want to see it?

577
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,000
If I say no, will you leave me?

578
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,320
Give it here.

579
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,240
How is it?

580
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,760
Mind blowing, Sarla.

581
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,880
What happen? - I cut my finger.

582
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,320
Give me that first-aid kit. - Yes.

583
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,840
What happen? - Nothing.

584
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,240
Does it pain?

585
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,040
Don't worry. It's just a small cut.

586
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,040
What is happening?

587
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,240
Sorry, ma'am.
Kartik was hurt, so I lost focus.

588
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,200
If you worry, did the pain stop?

589
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
If you cry did the bleeding stop?

590
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,760
It's not wrong liking some one

591
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,720
but don't make others
suffer because of it.

592
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,200
Without showing any concern,
she is getting angry.

593
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,920
Even getting angry is one type
of concern. Only if you understand.

594
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
Now-a-days, I can't understand you.

595
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,240
It's difficult to understand you.

596
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,440
Hello, son.

597
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,960
What?
- Tomorrow's prospective...

598
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Hi.

599
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,040
Hey, the same lady.

600
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,440
Come, let's meet her.

601
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,960
Keep it.

602
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,880
I was just seeing whether you were
the same guy or not. How are you?

603
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,880
Yes, I am good.
How come you are here?

604
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,840
She must be here to meet
again someone for her daughter.

605
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,440
Hey. - Yes, son.

606
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,040
You are saying it so nervously,
that means...

607
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,280
Nobody will like it,
if the mother comes with the girl.

608
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,560
Correct.

609
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,320
Who is he, madam? In one day,
you arranged two meetings?

610
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,480
No. I know these people.

611
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,640
Do you want some coffee?
- We just had it.

612
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,680
Why are you trying so hard, aunty?

613
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,560
You can tell your daughter, right?

614
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,800
If she listens, I can shout at her.

615
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,160
She is not afraid of anybody.

616
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,920
I must not say this but,

617
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,320
she is a monster.

618
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
Even her daughter is like our madam.

619
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,600
Are you married?

620
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,480
No, aunty.
But I am in love with someone.

621
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,640
Oh, good, good, good.

622
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,040
There's nothing good.
Everything's bad.

623
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,120
Why are you saying that?

624
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,520
I can't explain it to you.

625
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,960
Almost, she is similar
like your daughter.

626
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,360
I don't understand
this generation girls.

627
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,400
Even if Lord Ram comes,
they will make excuses.

628
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,040
Oh, time's up.
She might be home soon.

629
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,880
Okay, I'll leave now. - Okay, aunty.

630
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,760
Son...

631
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,480
Take my phone number.

632
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,200
If you know any nice guy,
please tell me. - Sure, aunty.

633
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,800
Bye, bye. - Okay, aunty.

634
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,160
They don't care,
if someone loves them,

635
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,400
they won't listen to their
mother if they like someone.

636
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,200
What do these women want?

637
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,800
Your problem is that
she is not caring me, right?

638
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,080
We'll show the sketch
tomorrow. - Okay.

639
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,160
That's it?

640
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,720
You came all the
way here just for this?

641
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,760
Impressive.

642
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,240
Will this be enough?

643
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,000
If I take something,
I'll make the job done.

644
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,920
I have that confidence on my work.

645
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,960
For the first time,
I was afraid that you would reject.

646
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,640
You made me look into myself.

647
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,920
This calls for a celebration.
Shall we go out for coffee?

648
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,000
I don't have a habit of that.

649
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,640
Even if it's late,
we can change few habits.

650
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,600
I don't like new habits.

651
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,680
Shall we show this
presentation to Uncle?

652
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,480
Can we go in my car?
- We will go in my car.

653
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,640
Chocolate?

654
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,960
No.

655
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,960
Why?

656
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,240
I don't like chocolates.

657
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,720
I gave you back your money.

658
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,160
Then what is this?

659
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,760
I am fine with the money.

660
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,160
What about my ego?

661
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,720
First of all,
I am very short tempered

662
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,960
also, I am aged now.

663
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,760
From the day you insulted me

664
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,840
my blood is boiling like anything.

665
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,760
If I leave you thinking
you are a girl...

666
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,920
but when people come
to know about this

667
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,560
next time someone comes and
throws slipper instead of cheque.

668
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,240
I am a person

669
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,280
when a branch comes in the middle,
I'll cut the whole tree.

670
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,600
And now,
you have dared to confront me!

671
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,880
Just being elder is not enough.

672
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,840
You should know to respect ladies.

673
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,160
Akash.

674
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,760
Weather is hot outside.
Go and sit in the car.

675
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,120
What did you say?

676
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,200
If branches come in the middle,
you will cut down the whole tree.

677
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,640
Celebrities are challenging
each other for growing trees.

678
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,000
And you are saying
you will cut the trees?

679
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,680
I just said it for a punch.

680
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,440
I have many plants in my house.
If you want you can come and see.

681
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,640
You must return the extra money,
wastage costs and everything, okay?

682
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,920
Okay, I'll give it back.

683
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,760
If you come in her way again

684
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,680
thinking your ego is
hurt and that bullshit.

685
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,360
My name is Akash.

686
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,880
I am everywhere above the ground.

687
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,280
Why did you hit him?
Did I tell you to hit him?

688
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,120
You came from somewhere, you will
leave after you finish your work.

689
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,240
After that,
if they come and make brawl?

690
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,800
Who will take the responsibility
for my staff safety?

691
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,000
You don't need to
hit anyone for my sake.

692
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,760
I know how to deal with everybody.

693
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,760
Just do your work.

694
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,760
Are you satisfied?

695
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,920
You won't get hug
even if you help her

696
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,800
or fought bad guys.

697
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,080
Because she is not
any cinema heroine.

698
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,080
Hey, if girls would
be impressed for fighting

699
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,080
then, only rowdies
will be having girlfriends.

700
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,880
And if you think I beat
those guys to impress Bhumi,

701
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,360
He was talking rubbish. It didn't
seem right, so I thrashed him.

702
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,360
She didn't like it.
And now she is angry.

703
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,240
If someone helps, they should
be thankful, not scold them.

704
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,880
Shall we go?

705
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,520
Okay.

706
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,320
What are you doing here?
- I came here to talk to sir.

707
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,240
About what? Go now.

708
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,760
It's urgent, ma'am.

709
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,560
It is more important
than 100 crores building?

710
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,360
You can talk later. Now leave.

711
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,400
I told you to leave.

712
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,120
Hi. When did you guys come?

713
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,680
Just now.

714
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,640
Where is Bindu?

715
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,120
I sent her back.
I came here to discuss the plan

716
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,520
and she was saying something stupid.

717
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,080
We can talk about the
plan tomorrow in the office?

718
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,560
She is in a life
and death situation.

719
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,960
What happened, Uncle?

720
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,680
Kartik's marriage is fixed.

721
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,800
That boy in the office
who is fair and has spectacles.

722
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,400
They like each other.

723
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,080
He is afraid of his family.

724
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,080
She is tensed

725
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,240
that he will get married
because of pressure of his family.

726
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,520
I told her I will solve that.

727
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,840
Sorry, uncle. - What sorry.

728
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,720
If you don't have any feelings

729
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,120
you think, nobody has feelings.

730
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,320
I will talk to them.

731
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,080
Kartik is with
his family in village.

732
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,720
I will go and talk to her.

733
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,560
She is an orphan.

734
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,080
They might ask her dowry.

735
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,080
I will give that and talk to them.

736
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,080
Kartik's family is so big.
They might not accept.

737
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,800
I will try to convince them.

738
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,760
Okay.

739
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,560
I will also come.

740
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,160
Bye, uncle. - Bye.

741
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,560
Don't think me as a villain
who is separating them.

742
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,320
I don't intend to hurt them.

743
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,640
But, he is the only
heir to our family.

744
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,920
And there is nothing wrong

745
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,440
if we have some expectations
for his marriage.

746
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,360
It is not correct
to make everyone suffer

747
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,440
by only choosing his choice.

748
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,240
He doesn't want you all to suffer.

749
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,400
That's the main reason
we are sitting here.

750
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,640
Family should support
their child to go ahead.

751
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,400
Sir, you shouldn't be
a hurdle to anyone's progress.

752
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,440
She is all alone.

753
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,720
I have no objection
against this girl.

754
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,200
At least there should be someone

755
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,880
who can say something
good or bad about her.

756
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,080
When she will come to your home

757
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,240
why do you need someone
who can say about that.

758
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,920
You all guys will be there.

759
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,560
For every girl, marriage
will make her leave her home.

760
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,040
But, for this marriage
she will get a family.

761
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,800
Don't say dialogues
as if you are in a cinema.

762
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,920
This love and all is bullshit
and this meeting is useless.

763
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,320
Yes, love is just four words.

764
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,200
But, it can separate two lives.

765
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,720
Love is just loving
and forgetting about it.

766
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,200
For loving someone,
it takes just one minute.

767
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,680
But for forgetting them,

768
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,520
whole life can't be enough.

769
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,320
I am much younger than you, sir.

770
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,280
It is up to you,
that you break their heart,

771
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,480
or make them marry each other.

772
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,320
I always thought girls family
should also be as big as ours.

773
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,080
If she thinks this
family as her own family

774
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,320
then why will I not accept her?

775
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,880
Thank you, sir.

776
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,840
You will never come to know,
that there is no one for her.

777
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,640
Bindu's marriage
responsibility is on us.

778
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,320
What do you say, Bhumi? - Yes.

779
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,200
Okay, then. Let's do their
marriage on the same date.

780
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,160
You talked to Mr. Naidu very nicely.

781
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,080
Thank you.

782
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,760
Apart from this architect job,
do you also lecture like this?

783
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,040
Or did you copy it from any book?

784
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,680
You can't even give a compliment.

785
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,840
What happened in last meeting?

786
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,040
Is it done?

787
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,400
If it was okay,
then why will I be in the temple.

788
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,800
I will be in search
for a good marriage marquee.

789
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,520
So, even your matter
is going slow like mine.

790
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,120
You also didn't tell
her that you love her?

791
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,920
No, aunty. If she is in front of
me I can talk to her about anything.

792
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,880
But expressing about my love,
I am a little bit scared.

793
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,000
But why should I
care about all that?

794
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,120
Do you want to see
my daughter's photo?

795
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,440
No, aunty. I love someone.

796
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,120
I also love my daughter.

797
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,440
I wonder when will your daughter
and my beloved understand our love.

798
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,200
What is this, aunty?

799
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,080
I am writing Ram's names
for a million times,

800
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,880
so that my daughter
gets married early.

801
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,600
If this work out, please tell me.
I will also write 10 million times.

802
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,880
Do you like her so much?

803
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,680
Is she beautiful?

804
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,320
She is so beautiful
and always proud.

805
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,480
How can I say you about her?
She is so perfect.

806
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,240
Does she like you?

807
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,920
I think, she also likes me.

808
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,240
But, she is not
expressing it outside.

809
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,240
These girls are all the same.

810
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,040
They wait until you leave.

811
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,440
If they have doubt that they'll
miss then they will express it.

812
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,800
I didn't get you.

813
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,120
Idea is so good. Will it workout?

814
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,400
Try it.

815
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,640
What if it fails?

816
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,520
Then you also write a
Ram's name a million times.

817
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,160
Prabha. - Yes.

818
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,520
What are you doing?

819
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,880
I am writing Ram's names
for a million times,

820
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,320
so that you get married early.

821
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,520
Looks like Lord Ram listened to you.

822
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,000
Now, stop writing it.

823
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,200
What are you saying?

824
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,480
Okay, now you don't
need to visit coffee shops

825
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,760
or any wedding websites.

826
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,000
Why?

827
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,000
Did you decide be a hermit?

828
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,280
Mom. -Then what?

829
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,360
I got whom I was searching for.

830
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,040
And from now on, you leave this pen

831
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,640
and start planning about marriage.

832
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,360
What are you saying?
Are you serious?

833
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,320
Bhumi.

834
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,560
Are you serious?

835
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,960
Bhumi,

836
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,240
I don't know,
what is happening to me.

837
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,600
I don't know, what to do?

838
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,360
Should I talk to the priest?

839
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,040
Should I call them
to make the marquee.

840
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,320
Or should I first pray God.
- Prabha. Prabha.

841
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,280
First be calm.
You do everything later.

842
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,680
I must tell him first.

843
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,080
What? You didn't say him yet?

844
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,160
I will tell him tomorrow.
- Why delay doing good things?

845
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,520
Call him right now.

846
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,440
Sure? - First call him.

847
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,680
Okay.

848
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,560
Bhumi... He likes you, right?

849
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,040
He didn't say me directly,
but I understood.

850
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,400
It will rain tonight.

851
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,760
Why?

852
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,880
You called me and asked me out.

853
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,560
Nothing. I didn't have
any work in my house.

854
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,640
I think you are
here to say something,

855
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,920
but you are not saying it.
- Nothing like that.

856
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,200
I just wanted to meet you casually.

857
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,120
Really? - Why are you
asking the same thing?

858
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,320
There is nothing to hide.

859
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,760
Are you hiding anything?

860
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,000
Nothing.
I am going to village tomorrow.

861
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,800
Oh, when will you be back?

862
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,680
After attending few programs,

863
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,280
I will be back once I finish it.

864
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,640
What programs?

865
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,840
What can I expect, when people my
age go home after these many years?

866
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,280
I am going to meet some girl.

867
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,520
I am almost 30.

868
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,240
My mother keeps yelling
me if I don't marry now,

869
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,720
I won't get any girl.

870
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,080
At least I must go
and see the girl, right?

871
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,040
If you like her, then?

872
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,360
You are okay to marry her. - Yes.

873
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,240
Aunt's idea is
working out actually.

874
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,760
Let me try a little bit.

875
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,880
Why didn't you marry yet?

876
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,720
You didn't get who you wanted,
or nobody liked you?

877
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,120
Do you think, it's a joke?

878
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,400
I am a joke to you, right?

879
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,840
What did you ask?
Why didn't I marry?

880
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,120
It feels nice while tying the knot.

881
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,120
If feels nice while holding hands,
with closed eyes.

882
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,120
I didn't understand all that.

883
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,520
That's why I didn't get married.
And I was never in love with anyone.

884
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,360
I didn't want to marry
someone else leaving you.

885
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,800
Bhumi... - Let me talk, Akash.

886
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,680
Let me talk.

887
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,280
How many times should I be a fool?

888
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,360
How many more times I should
be wrong in front of you?

889
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,160
It's my mistake.
It's all my mistake.

890
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,920
I made a mistake falling
in love with you before.

891
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,240
And I made a mistake again
falling in love with you.

892
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,920
I shouldn't have done this.

893
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,000
Anyway, this isn't called
falling in love again.

894
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,600
Because I didn't forget you.

895
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,200
I thought, I forgot everything
that happened before

896
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,360
but once I met you
again I know I was wrong.

897
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,880
But once I saw you again,

898
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,640
I knew I didn't forget anything.

899
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,960
That's why,
I couldn't connect to anyone.

900
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,600
You said once that
I look great in sari.

901
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,800
And I couldn't see
myself in another thing.

902
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,520
You look great in Sari.

903
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,640
You ran a campaign in
college based on save nature.

904
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,560
I started a company on that basis.

905
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,840
"Save the nature"

906
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,040
"Save the nature"

907
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,360
"Save the nature"

908
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,240
I came to know that,
whatever I do, whatever I wear,

909
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,360
you are there in part of my life.

910
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,840
I see you everywhere.

911
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,440
I realised it when I met you.

912
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,280
You know, what is most
painful thing in girls life?

913
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,760
That, they couldn't express
their love to someone they love.

914
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,160
To forget the love
and see the world.

915
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,000
If you dial a wrong number,

916
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,480
it doesn't go to right person
even if you redial it again.

917
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,320
Bhumi.

918
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,480
It's over, Akash. It's over.

919
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,800
There is nothing to talk now.

920
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,680
I think,
we are not meant for each other.

921
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,040
Though Bhumi (Land) and
Akash (sky) are facing each other,

922
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,520
they couldn't meet ever.

923
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,160
You and I are the same.

924
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,560
Good Bye.

925
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,360
If you dial a wrong number,

926
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,600
it doesn't go to right person
even if you redial it again.

927
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,760
I remember the day I met him.

928
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,800
In fact I remember every
moment when I was with him.

929
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,440
Akash, it's three words.

930
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,800
Six feet of form,
seven years of memories.

931
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,000
Even here the same books. You
should listen lessons in the class.

932
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,960
Here you should learn
what are not in the lessons.

933
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,200
I will help you practice that.

934
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,480
These engineering girls
have the same problem.

935
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,880
They see biology
as something different.

936
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,000
My guys worked very hard
and cleared the traffic.

937
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,280
If you won't give at least one kiss

938
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,000
they will feel very bad.

939
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,600
Just one kiss, okay?

940
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,320
Kiss me.

941
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,880
I searched everything, but
I didn't find the author you said.

942
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,400
Just check this. It looks fine?

943
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,920
Who are these guys? Your classmates?

944
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,360
Where is Shiva?

945
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,800
Shiva.

946
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,920
I am right here.

947
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,440
Where did you go?
I told you to be with her.

948
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,000
I went there to
prepare for supplies.

949
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,520
What are you guys doing here?
I was waiting in the canteen.

950
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,280
What will someone do in the library?
We were searching books.

951
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,640
Where is the librarian?

952
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,520
Here. - There he is.

953
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,480
Good morning, sir.

954
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,920
I told you to clear everything.

955
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,920
Bye.

956
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,040
You were alone here
surrounded by ten idiots.

957
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,160
I understood the situation. So...

958
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,240
New admission?

959
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,800
Looks like CSE.

960
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,280
We build the buildings
and they arrange the computers.

961
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,120
Time's up. Let's go to the class.

962
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,000
I had heard of love at first sight

963
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,200
but it happened
to me when I saw him.

964
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,480
I felt instant connection with him.

965
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,720
I felt like we know
each other by ages.

966
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,560
I wanted to be with him.

967
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,080
Who was the guy that helped you.

968
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,920
I don't know. I think
he is from some other branch.

969
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,040
At least he was there
to help you in correct time.

970
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,880
I didn't even say thanks to him.

971
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,760
He is from the same campus, right?
You can say him some other time.

972
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,160
Where did I lost the watch?

973
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,480
Don't worry, you will find it.

974
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,600
Have you lost something?

975
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,000
Yes, something very important.

976
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:20,920
Is this what you were searching for?

977
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,880
Yes.

978
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,000
Thank you so much.

979
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,000
You were in the library...

980
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,560
My name is Akash.

981
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,160
Bhumi. Bhumika.
This is my friend, Anjali.

982
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,400
Hi. - Hi.

983
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,880
I thought I lost it.

984
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,960
I am very happy that I got it.

985
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,320
Why are you so excited?

986
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,960
Nobody will take it even
if you give it for free. - Hey...

987
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,200
Thank you. - You already said that.

988
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,720
This is for helping
me in the library.

989
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,080
It's okay.

990
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,720
'I didn't even know
him until yesterday.'

991
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,720
'Now wherever I look,
I only see him.'

992
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,840
"Save the nature"

993
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,200
'I am feeling like the whole world'

994
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,800
'is bringing me closer to him.'

995
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,960
He even found my favourite watch.

996
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,280
Give me the ball.

997
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,720
Wonderful!

998
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,280
What did we discuss yesterday?
- Don't you remember?

999
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,320
I want to know,
you remember it or not?

1000
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,880
Who was that? Stand up.

1001
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,160
Let everybody see
who that great person is?

1002
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,040
I thought it,
when I heard the voice. Idiot.

1003
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,760
Tell me,
what did we discuss yesterday.

1004
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,480
I am like Gajini, sir.
I forget things very easily.

1005
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,960
Radha, you tell me.
- Her name is Swathi, sir.

1006
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,000
Gajini can remember these things?

1007
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,880
Shameless fellow. Sit down.

1008
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,400
I won't care about the attendance,
I will miss his class.

1009
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,880
Did you enjoy it?
- Keep quiet! - Hold on.

1010
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:22,200
Oh, Akash is appointed
as head of the cultural fest.

1011
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,400
Wow.

1012
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,480
Congrats, man.

1013
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,760
Thanks. - Superb.

1014
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,440
Let's go, come on.
- Wait for one minute.

1015
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,880
Who will help Akash as
a volunteer from this class?

1016
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,400
I will help him.
- Come on, let's go.

1017
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,840
What is your name? - Naya.

1018
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,280
What can you do? - Dance.

1019
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,880
Will you dance with me? - No.

1020
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,160
Give this paper to him. - Okay.

1021
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,240
Hey, you are here for? - Volunteers.

1022
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,880
Hey, watch. Learn something
from them. - Okay, okay.

1023
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,280
Write their names too. - Okay.

1024
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,120
What? Swathi won't dance?

1025
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,560
Rahul don't like dancing
her on the stage.

1026
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,680
He don't want boys
teasing her from the crowd.

1027
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,640
Who is he to control her?
- He is his boyfriend, so.

1028
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,160
So, he won't respect his girlfriend?

1029
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,200
If you are in his place,
you will do the same.

1030
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,800
If I was in his place

1031
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,600
and if my girlfriend
would like to dance

1032
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,880
I would've enjoyed cheering
her from the crowd.

1033
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,840
Okay, come.

1034
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,360
Now what? If that dance is
cancelled, our program will be flop.

1035
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,320
I will do it.

1036
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,760
Are you sure? - Yeah.

1037
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,000
I should go and practice. - Bye.

1038
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,280
All the best.

1039
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,560
Will she able to do it?
- Do we have any other option?

1040
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,360
You danced very beautifully.

1041
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,760
Hello, I was the best
dancer in my school.

1042
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,120
Is it?

1043
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,760
Then why didn't you say that first.

1044
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,600
We were so tensed
till the last minute.

1045
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,200
I didn't want to participate.

1046
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,720
I did it for you.

1047
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,920
I didn't want the
program to be flop.

1048
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,880
Oh!

1049
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,680
Anyway, I don't know whether
you heard the claps or not,

1050
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,840
but I can still hear them.

1051
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:24,760
'I felt like I was on cloud
nine when he was praising me.

1052
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,560
'I felt like kissing
my mom because she forced me'

1053
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,600
'to go to dance
school in childhood.'

1054
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,840
Here, here.

1055
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,400
Lift it. Lift it.

1056
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,880
Hey. Throw it this side.
- Very good.

1057
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,280
This way. Come on.
- Very good. That side.

1058
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,840
Madam, dance was so nice.

1059
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,120
Thank you. - What do you say guys?

1060
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,600
If audience say once more,
artist will do it again, right?

1061
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:57,000
Just do it once more for us.
Just one step.

1062
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:02,520
We just get to see it once,
and practice and all only with him?

1063
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,720
Let's go.

1064
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,200
Madam, if you get bore with him,

1065
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,040
my door is always open.

1066
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,440
You are sad because you
lost the quiz competition?

1067
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:28,840
Hey.

1068
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,800
Cheer up, Bhumi.

1069
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,400
It was just a small thing.

1070
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,320
That was not a small thing.

1071
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,400
I never failed in anything.

1072
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,280
If you win always,
it won't be thrilling.

1073
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,840
You must lose sometimes
to enjoy the thrill of the win.

1074
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,080
Chocolate.

1075
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,200
Thank you.
- You can say it by smiling.

1076
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,760
Think that was the first
prize in the quiz competition.

1077
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,520
Bhumi.

1078
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,160
You look beautiful when you smile.

1079
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,480
'You look beautiful when you smile.'

1080
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,680
You are doing the
same thing from evening.

1081
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,080
Stop seeing yourself in the mirror.

1082
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,960
Many people said that
my smile is beautiful.

1083
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,200
But I never felt
this special about it.

1084
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,080
See, he gave me this chocolate.

1085
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,080
Will you frame it or what?

1086
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,560
He gave my favourite things.
I think, he likes me.

1087
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:49,000
There is a big difference
between liking and recognising it.

1088
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,560
You think he doesn't know,
but I think he does.

1089
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,880
If you switch off the light,
I will go to sleep.

1090
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,520
You guys here to beat me?

1091
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,400
I don't think it is nice
to fight inside the college.

1092
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:31,000
Bhumi.

1093
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,200
Bhumi.

1094
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,880
Why are so tensed? What happened?

1095
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,720
In the ground,
Dhanush's gang and Akash...

1096
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,320
Comment him again?
Our boy walked away calmly, right?

1097
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,880
Back in the day,
Dhanush was talking rubbish

1098
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,560
and Akash didn't even dare to fight
them. He didn't even looked angry.

1099
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,360
Hello, first listen to me.

1100
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,120
Did he beat them so bad?
- Not just a little...

1101
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,920
...but very badly.

1102
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,040
Why do you think he beat them?

1103
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,000
I too don't know.

1104
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,240
What are you thinking,
please tell me?

1105
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,640
He beat them because Dhanush
was commenting on me, right?

1106
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,480
It doesn't matter, what I think.

1107
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,840
What he thinks matters.

1108
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,160
What is this? - Shivaratri.

1109
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,760
Do you know any temple nearby?

1110
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,400
I have it in a cupboard in my room.

1111
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,880
You are looking beautiful.

1112
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:45,560
You are so beautiful in sari.

1113
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,920
Cinema heroes and college
guys have the same reaction

1114
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,520
when they see a girl in sari.

1115
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,200
Nothing like that.
I saw many girls in sari

1116
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:56,880
but I never told this to anyone.

1117
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,920
Today is a holiday.
What are your plans?

1118
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,440
Nothing.

1119
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,080
My friends just went to the match.
- You are not going?

1120
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,920
One second. Hello.

1121
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,120
Yeah.

1122
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:14,680
Okay.

1123
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,720
Will you say it?

1124
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,600
Okay.

1125
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,080
Girlfriend?

1126
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,480
Just like her.

1127
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,240
Mother.

1128
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,640
Seriously,
do you have any girlfriend?

1129
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,560
No. - Sure?

1130
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,280
Why are you asking that?

1131
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,080
You look handsome, talk nicely.

1132
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,240
Even you fight when it's necessary.

1133
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,960
In simple words,
you look like a hero.

1134
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,960
Oh, is it? Nobody else
felt it that way I guess.

1135
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,040
Nobody is there in my heart.
It's true.

1136
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,720
Hello, paper?

1137
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,120
Sorry, sir. - Okay.

1138
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,080
What if, Akash is also
confused to ask me out?

1139
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,160
I will ask him whether
he likes me or not.

1140
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,960
Don't think, just ask him.

1141
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,080
Can girls take the first step?

1142
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,040
Do you want to wait for few years?

1143
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,000
Hey, are you able to
understand what am I saying?

1144
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,400
Just think about your parents.

1145
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,840
Remember, how many hopes
your parents must have on you.

1146
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,920
You didn't study
all this for her, right?

1147
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,680
You are a lucky fellow.

1148
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,800
Don't feel bad,
because she rejected you.

1149
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,320
Be happy.

1150
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,400
If I was in your place,

1151
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,040
I would've been so happy.

1152
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,960
I would've partied all night
thinking my future didn't stop here.

1153
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,680
You would've known if
you fall in love with someone.

1154
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,760
Yes. I never loved anyone
nor I will love anyone.

1155
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,640
What is there in this love.

1156
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,840
Just giving flowers and talk
with each other the whole night.

1157
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,280
You can get girlfriend
anytime in your life.

1158
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:26,000
But think about your goal,
if you miss now, you can't reach it.

1159
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,920
Whatever is lost,
we can get it later.

1160
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,200
But if you waste your time,
it won't come back.

1161
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,200
I never wasted time till now,

1162
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,480
also I will never waste my time
in this useless things like love.

1163
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,680
Bhumi.

1164
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,480
You are leaving?

1165
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,040
Yes.

1166
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,360
Even I have a flight in the evening.

1167
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,880
What else?
- Nothing. I came here to say, bye.

1168
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,680
Yeah, yeah. Bye, Bhumi.

1169
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,840
Don't know, when we will meet again.

1170
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,400
Okay, be in touch.

1171
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,360
Bye.

1172
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,560
'I felt like he was
directly saying to me.'

1173
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,720
'Whatever he said to him,
I felt it was just for me.'

1174
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,840
'Few questions are answered
without even finding the answer.'

1175
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,640
'Now I know,
what Akash has in his heart.'

1176
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,680
'I felt happy before when
he said no one is in his heart.'

1177
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:54,000
'But I understood that,
even I am not there in his heart.'

1178
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,000
'If we read the
book again and again'

1179
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,880
'will the story change in the end?'

1180
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,920
'If you think it will change,
then you are a fool.'

1181
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,400
What happened? Did you tell him?

1182
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,320
What did he say?

1183
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,960
Did he say yes?

1184
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,520
No, mom.

1185
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,680
He is not correct for me.
- What happened?

1186
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:31,680
Didn't he like you?

1187
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,520
Leave him.

1188
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:39,960
Just say one word, I will bring more
handsome and nice guys then him.

1189
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,040
Just leave it, mom.

1190
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,400
This marriage and
all is not my thing.

1191
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,520
What do you mean?

1192
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,160
You won't marry?

1193
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,680
I believed you and
I stopped praying.

1194
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:56,240
So now, pray to get rid of me.

1195
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,200
I am so unfortunate.

1196
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,360
You are like a burden on my heart.

1197
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,880
Prabha. What are you saying?

1198
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,680
Go out of here.

1199
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,720
Go.

1200
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,600
Responsibilities are
same for mother and father

1201
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:18,080
over their children.

1202
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,120
But, in this house
it is not the same.

1203
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,560
Here, nobody cares.

1204
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,120
Even if you are not interested
in marrying your daughter,

1205
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,240
at least did you think about it?

1206
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,080
I am neither worries nor thoughts.

1207
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,120
nor I take the responsibility,

1208
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,600
okay?

1209
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:54,320
Do we just make children
just to marry them, Prabha?

1210
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,160
You are right.

1211
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,960
Marriage is necessary, but that is
not the only thing that's important.

1212
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,520
We have children with high hopes.

1213
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:08,520
We work hard to raise them,
and educate them beyond our means.

1214
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,200
And give them whatever they need.

1215
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,960
Just to marry them with someone?

1216
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,920
We do all this because
we want to see them live happily.

1217
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,440
Why can't we wait,
till they search for themselves?

1218
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,920
Why can't we know
their choices, Prabha?

1219
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,600
Why can't we give the
same amount of time to a girl

1220
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,560
like we give to a boy.

1221
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,800
Why do we hurry only
for girls marriages?

1222
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,520
If we ask them,
people say, what will society think.

1223
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,960
If we marry her in some
place where she is not happy

1224
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,560
who will suffer in the end?

1225
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,280
When a girl turns 13,
you should sanction her.

1226
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,240
If she turns 25, just marry her
with someone and loose the burden.

1227
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:00,720
I can't think like
an outmoded father.

1228
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,640
In my eyes,

1229
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,640
I am not a failure,
if I don't do her marriage.

1230
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,760
I can't make her marry
where she doesn't want to marry.

1231
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,600
Not until, if there's
a situation where I am ashamed

1232
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,600
let anybody think
whatever they want.

1233
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,320
I really don't care and I mean it.

1234
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,040
Morning, Daddy. - Hey, morning.

1235
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:09,120
Daddy, I am going to Alak
for one week for Bindu's marriage.

1236
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,440
We are organising it.

1237
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,840
Good, good. Enjoy.

1238
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,400
She is helping in everybody's
marriage, but she won't do it.

1239
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,800
We can argue and can
even change the judgement

1240
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:23,160
but we can't change
your mother's heart.

1241
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,600
It's really impossible.

1242
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:34,520
Mom, I am leaving in the evening.

1243
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,400
If I say no, will you stop?

1244
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,240
You never listen to me.

1245
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,040
Now, what?

1246
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,320
I should get married, right?

1247
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:48,080
Mom, who can think that
I should be good more than you.

1248
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,840
You see, whoever you like.

1249
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,000
Huh, really?

1250
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,640
Yes.

1251
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,200
Just see,
how nice guy I will search for you.

1252
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,960
I will kill the guy who rejects you.

1253
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,760
What is that look?
Give me that phone.

1254
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:52,720
Give me.

1255
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,960
Why are you guys so serious? Laugh.

1256
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,560
What happened to you, ma'am?

1257
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,280
You changed your
dressing and your style.

1258
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,160
What is the fun
being the same person

1259
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,600
in the marriage and in office?

1260
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,640
There should be some entertainment
in one's life, right?

1261
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,160
You are giving us
some shocking news.

1262
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,600
This look suits
you very much, ma'am.

1263
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,920
Yes, ma'am. Looks like your
age has been decreased five years.

1264
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,400
So, is it fine if I have
still five years left to marry?

1265
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,800
Look, they all are here.
- Hey, Bhumi.

1266
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,160
Uncle.

1267
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,880
All your friends came?

1268
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,240
If you have any problem, just ask.

1269
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,360
Sure, uncle.

1270
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,240
Where is Akash?

1271
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:45,480
He is.. - There he is.

1272
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,200
Come.

1273
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,760
I was talking about you.

1274
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,160
How was your travelling?
- It was nice.

1275
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,120
Okay.

1276
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,880
I thought you went to your village.

1277
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,040
How can I leave you all?

1278
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,280
Did you see the location?
It is so good.

1279
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,840
If you are okay,
we will make a nice couple video.

1280
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:14,080
Do with me, Sarla.
I will also become famous.

1281
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,240
For a couple video we need a hero,
not comedian.

1282
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,560
Hey, don't you know how
to talk in front of everybody?

1283
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,080
They arrived just now,
let them take rest.

1284
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:26,560
Don't feel bad.

1285
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,160
Hari.

1286
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,000
Come here. Show them their room.

1287
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,720
I should only do all the work.

1288
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,640
Come fast.

1289
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,840
I am coming, what's the hurry?

1290
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,840
He is like that. He is little slow.

1291
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,200
It doesn't matter,
but the work should be done.

1292
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,040
Take that. Go to your room.

1293
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:55,400
Hey, listen! Find out
why are decorators aren't here.

1294
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,880
Who is he? Looks like he
is a brand ambassador for laziness.

1295
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,440
I don't know.
- Walk little fast.

1296
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,680
If I go fast will
I get any prize? - Oh...

1297
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,160
Okay, you come late but
tell us where our room is.

1298
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,440
Climb the stairs and turn left.

1299
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,920
Take left after the stairs. Okay.

1300
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,800
We will go,
you can bring this by noon.

1301
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,280
Don't mock me!

1302
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:31,280
Did you see Bhumi.
She changed her style.

1303
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,000
She is beautiful even like this.
- Are you feeling happy?

1304
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:40,280
She changed her style because

1305
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,120
she doesn't like you.

1306
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,800
That is a bad sign.
Don't get excited.

1307
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,360
You should be alert.

1308
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,160
Take this.

1309
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:58,800
Use it.

1310
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,840
If I want to save
it I need to go to bank,

1311
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,120
if I want to use it,
I need to go to shop.

1312
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,640
I don't have that much patience.
Keep it, yourself.

1313
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,720
Hey.

1314
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,080
It was really fun. Did you see?

1315
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,480
Once.

1316
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:21,880
One more time.

1317
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,000
Tiktok batch, I guess.

1318
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,280
Hi, Pooja.

1319
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:32,720
Akash. - Akash.

1320
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,000
I took that social media reel

1321
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,320
but you look like a cinema hero.

1322
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:40,640
Come.

1323
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,200
Weather is so good, right?

1324
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,360
I like this kind of weather.

1325
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,880
What a change, ma'am.
All this because of this place?

1326
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,880
If there is no pressure in here,

1327
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,400
then you can be happy
wherever you want.

1328
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:55,600
Hi, Bhumi.

1329
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,480
Sir, location is so good, right?

1330
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,880
Come we'll take a selfie.
- Come, we'll take one.

1331
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,880
Why are you leaving?
This is a group selfie?

1332
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,800
I am bored here.
I'm going to my room.

1333
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,200
Hello, is this Birju?
- Don't you know, who you called?

1334
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,880
What's the matter?

1335
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,600
The girl you saw
yesterday accepted you.

1336
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,800
I saw her yesterday,
and she accepted me today?

1337
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,640
So soon? Say no.

1338
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,640
Are you driving this car or pushing?

1339
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,240
How much time will it take?
Is this car or bullock cart?

1340
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,200
Already, I am driving at 100 kmph.
- Drive at 200 kmph.

1341
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,600
If I drive it at that speed,
you won't go to marriage

1342
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:36,960
you will go and meet God.

1343
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,480
Do you want to go?

1344
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:43,840
Get down.

1345
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:45,800
Get down.

1346
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:49,280
Bloody old ladies.
Can't get down and can't climb up.

1347
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,720
Why did you sit in the middle?

1348
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:53,640
I sat first. Then they came in.

1349
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,960
I don't have change.
Just wait here for five minutes.

1350
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,520
What did you say? I won't even
wait for any girl for that time.

1351
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,200
You think,
I'll wait for your change?

1352
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,760
Bring the change and take the money.

1353
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,040
Or else leave.

1354
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,600
Everywhere there is lag.
- Hey, Birju, how are you?

1355
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,720
Yesterday lorry hit him.
This is his soul.

1356
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:11,320
You ask stupid questions.
- He won't reform.

1357
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,120
Oh, God!

1358
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,400
I am the only active person
amongst these lazy people.

1359
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,400
Hey, man.
Just bring me that water bottle.

1360
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,120
I sat just now,

1361
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,480
and you already gave me other work.

1362
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,000
Oh, God!

1363
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,400
He is so slow,
looks like even lag is lagging.

1364
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,000
Please wait.

1365
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,600
Don't work hard.
I will go and get it.

1366
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,280
Oh, God! When will go there?

1367
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,880
It will take ten days
to you to reach there?

1368
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,360
You and your slow motion!

1369
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,640
Thank God, one work is done.

1370
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,160
He is too slow man.

1371
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:02,520
Hi, how are you?

1372
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,640
Hey, Birju.
Why did you come this late?

1373
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,080
Normally I will go to
weddings at the last moment,

1374
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,640
but this is our Kartik's wedding,
so I came very early.

1375
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,640
Okay, wash your legs.
I will make you breakfast.

1376
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:14,440
Oh, when I eat with
hand why should I wash legs?

1377
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,920
Time waste.
I will eat it now, itself.

1378
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,800
Oh, is this idly or bricks?

1379
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,160
He is brainless.

1380
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,480
What? - That's what I am asking you?

1381
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,920
You blocked my number.

1382
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:01,920
If I come and talk to you,
you are just leaving.

1383
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,880
You are not even
giving me time to speak.

1384
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,880
I need to talk to you.
- Akash, please.

1385
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,400
I have nothing to talk.

1386
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:12,200
Just listen what I am saying.
- I said, no.

1387
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,160
Actually, that day...

1388
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,080
I am trying very
hard to forget that.

1389
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:21,080
Please don't remind me.
- Just listen what I am saying once.

1390
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,640
I am begging you.

1391
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:25,360
What else do you want me to do?
Should I catch your legs?

1392
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,520
Oh, oh.

1393
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,320
You slow coach! Where are you from?

1394
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,480
Hey, brother. Won't you
introduce me to your friend?

1395
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,080
He is not my friend. He is my sir.

1396
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:59,360
Oh, sir! Which soap do you use?

1397
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,960
Who invented this marriages.

1398
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:10,120
Brother, you have so much height
between your feet and your head.

1399
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,840
And she doesn't
even have any height.

1400
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:25,880
What is this?

1401
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,160
Rose. - Why?

1402
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:30,000
For love.
I liked you at the first sight.

1403
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,240
You also should tell
your heart to love me.

1404
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,760
Go ahead! There is lots
of food for all. Please go ahead.

1405
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:41,440
Eat to your heart's content,
and praise the Lord. Okay?

1406
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,360
Aunty, is everybody good?
- Hey, Mr Birju.

1407
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,440
You reserved first seat for food.

1408
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,200
Brother, you are the
only person who understood me.

1409
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,640
Thank you.
- Do you want to sit beside me?

1410
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,000
No, I will sit somewhere else.
- Come, let's go.

1411
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,560
He is a different type.

1412
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:53,400
I will be the very first one

1413
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,000
who will be served.

1414
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:58,040
Hey, start serving from this corner.

1415
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:01,960
Oh, my God!

1416
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,840
What? You guys are
serving from that side?

1417
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,800
For just pickle it
took fifteen minutes.

1418
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,760
Just ask whatever you want.
- Oh, my God!

1419
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:13,360
Uncle, I can't wait for
every item to come from that side.

1420
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,680
I can't control the hunger.

1421
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,280
Don't be angry, Mr Birju.
- What do I do?

1422
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,800
I will send a guy who
won't lag and will serve you.

1423
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,080
Thank you, brother.

1424
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,120
Hey.

1425
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:29,240
Oh, this guy!

1426
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,040
I think, I am not lucky today.

1427
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:21,120
Bhumi, why do you keep
your face always angry?

1428
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:22,960
You know, how cute you look

1429
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,840
while you sleep like this.

1430
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:26,720
Oh!

1431
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:33,120
Why didn't I observe
you like this back then?

1432
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,360
I want to say one thing,

1433
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,360
if I get any chance
to rewind my life again.

1434
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,440
I will go back to our college days

1435
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,080
and I will start living again,

1436
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:49,040
but this time with you.

1437
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,280
But now, there is no chance of that

1438
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,360
I want to continue
my life being with you.

1439
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:05,840
I want to experience your love.

1440
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,360
When will you show me?

1441
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:11,880
I have many things to say you.

1442
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:14,360
Not like this,
I want you to hear me.

1443
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:17,840
While seeing in your eyes.

1444
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,280
Good night.

1445
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,800
You should've told me first.

1446
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,960
Why did you make it so complicated?

1447
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,720
If she is angry,

1448
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,280
she won't listen to anyone.

1449
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,600
I am the reason,
why is she like that.

1450
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:49,560
She loved me so much, that
she couldn't find any other person.

1451
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,960
These days, people are
marrying after calculations

1452
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:59,280
but she stayed single for her love.

1453
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,960
Nobody loves anyone
else so much, uncle.

1454
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,920
Without knowing I made
her suffer very much.

1455
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:11,800
I will wait for years

1456
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,320
till she knows my love.

1457
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:21,760
Okay, then.

1458
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,320
Pack this. - Hey.

1459
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,080
Come here.

1460
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:36,680
Keep it there.

1461
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,400
See there.

1462
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:52,440
Hello. - How is the guy?
Did you like him?

1463
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,040
Tell something.

1464
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:58,680
Did you change your heart again?

1465
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,160
Remember, you gave me your word.

1466
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:05,280
Yes, he is nice.
- Should I arrange the meeting.

1467
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,320
It's up to you.

1468
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:18,560
Bye.

1469
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,480
Sister, they are waiting
for you in the bride's room.

1470
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:28,520
Come. Let's go.

1471
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,800
Hello. - How are you?

1472
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:47,920
How is the wedding going?

1473
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,880
All good, daddy. How are you?

1474
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,440
I am good.

1475
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,440
Your mom is so excited
for your engagement.

1476
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,760
Hey,

1477
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:03,240
did you like him for real

1478
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,280
or you just said okay
because of your mother.

1479
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,120
If you don't like him, tell me.
Don't think about her.

1480
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,280
Nothing like that, Daddy.

1481
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,320
I am okay.

1482
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:15,360
Okay, take care.

1483
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,080
Bye, daddy. - Bye.

1484
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:50,440
"The groom and the bride are ready,
to be for each other."

1485
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:56,080
"The groom and the bride are ready,
to be for each other."

1486
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,440
Bhumi, you will come soon, right?

1487
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,080
Tomorrow is the engagement.

1488
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:06,320
If you come home and take rest,
you will be fresh in the morning.

1489
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,680
Okay, I'll come.

1490
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,680
Bhumi, I want to talk to you.

1491
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:18,680
Congrats.

1492
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:21,120
We did it.

1493
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:26,120
We wanted to do their
marriage together. We did it.

1494
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,680
Now we don't have to act.

1495
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,440
You think, this is all just an act?

1496
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,560
Isn't it?

1497
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:38,800
I think, you are still angry on me.

1498
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:42,880
I am not upset with you,
but I don't like you.

1499
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,600
Please, don't trouble me.

1500
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,200
What did I do?

1501
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,680
Time's up. I need to go.

1502
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,000
Why are you in hurry?

1503
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,680
Tomorrow is my engagement.

1504
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:47,320
This made me closer to you.

1505
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,840
If I give it back to you?

1506
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,600
I am afraid you will
never meet me again.

1507
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:55,280
Nice.

1508
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,800
If I don't want to remember you

1509
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,240
I should not keep anything
that reminds me of you.

1510
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:03,560
Wait, Bhumi.

1511
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,760
What? What is your problem?

1512
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,840
I need to talk to you.
Just give five minutes.

1513
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:19,800
I don't want to talk to you.
- You loved me so much.

1514
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:22,680
You can't give me five minutes?

1515
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:27,560
Just wait.

1516
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:39,160
Why are you leaving
when I am talking to you?

1517
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:42,200
Won't you listen what I want to say?

1518
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,800
I didn't say it
when I should've said.

1519
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:48,440
I didn't listen when
I should've listened.

1520
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,280
You loved me, you felt it,

1521
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,160
you are breaking up,
and you are leaving.

1522
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:56,040
Then who will think about me?

1523
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,000
Only you have feelings?

1524
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,080
I don't have it or what?

1525
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,400
Do you know, why I came
here after all these years?

1526
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,720
Why am I roaming around you?

1527
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,720
Did you think about it even once?

1528
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,000
I didn't come here for any project,

1529
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,640
or any marriage function.

1530
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,760
I came here only for you.

1531
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,800
When I knew that you loved me,

1532
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,800
I couldn't stay there and
I searched for you and came here.

1533
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:46,080
Hi, how are you?
Yes, I have reached.

1534
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:47,680
I am so sorry.

1535
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,400
Akash.

1536
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:53,680
Anjali. What are you doing here?

1537
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,640
How is your friend, Bhumi?

1538
01:38:56,720 --> 01:39:00,200
After college, we didn't meet. - Oh!

1539
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:04,120
She didn't tell
you but she loved you.

1540
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,480
She just used to think about you.

1541
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:14,080
She always tried to talk to you.

1542
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,760
At that moment

1543
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:21,040
I saw it from your view.

1544
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:31,560
I didn't want to participate.
I did for you.

1545
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,400
Seriously,
you don't have any girlfriend?

1546
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,680
No.

1547
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:48,320
After knowing that,

1548
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,360
I didn't like what I was doing?

1549
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,440
I didn't know where to find you.

1550
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:54,280
I didn't know what were you doing?

1551
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:58,320
I searched for you.
I called everybody whoever I knew.

1552
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,640
I searched you in social media.

1553
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:03,640
You were nowhere.

1554
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,280
Where are you?
You are still in love with me?

1555
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,800
Or did you forget me?

1556
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,400
Gautam. - Yes.

1557
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,560
She is in Hyderabad.
She is running a startup company.

1558
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,600
Guess what?
My father is funding the company.

1559
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:26,240
Hey, Akash. One more thing.
She is not married yet.

1560
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:27,880
I don't know why,

1561
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:30,000
after hearing that,
I couldn't control my happiness.

1562
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:33,640
I couldn't stay there any longer.

1563
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:38,600
I thought you will
be excited when you see me.

1564
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,320
But, when I saw you
behaving so casually

1565
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,720
I didn't know how to react.

1566
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:48,560
I thought you moved on.

1567
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,560
I wanted to observe
you very closely,

1568
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,400
so I took up this project.

1569
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,840
I felt very attractive

1570
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:59,760
when I saw you changed totally.

1571
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:05,200
So, I loved you,
when you made me recognise myself.

1572
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,880
I just wanted to know

1573
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,320
what you think about me,
so I lied about the bridesmaids.

1574
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:14,280
I listened that you loved me.

1575
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:17,480
But that was first time I saw,
how you felt about me.

1576
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:19,880
I didn't know your love.

1577
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,280
I made you feel very sad.

1578
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:24,680
You left that night,

1579
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:27,320
I thought you were angry on me.

1580
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:31,520
I was waiting that
you will come back.

1581
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,200
But,

1582
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,920
you are leaving this watch...

1583
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,480
now I can understand,

1584
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:46,600
you left me on that day itself.

1585
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:53,720
I thought I understood
your love very late,

1586
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,800
but now I get that,

1587
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,520
it is very late.

1588
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:22,160
This is a small project.
- I am saying I'll do it.

1589
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:23,920
I need to talk to you.

1590
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,400
Akash, please.
I don't want to talk to you.

1591
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:38,120
Sister, everyone is leaving.

1592
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,920
Call Akash.

1593
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:54,920
Mom is waiting, uncle.

1594
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:56,560
I need to go.

1595
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,440
Sarla, bring the bag.

1596
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:32,800
You already came? Come here.

1597
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,280
Let's go.

1598
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:43,200
Bhumi. They will
arrive anytime soon.

1599
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:44,440
Get ready.

1600
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,880
Go Bhumi.

1601
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:24,440
Please smile, Madam.
You look beautiful when you smile.

1602
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:34,680
Did you connect at first sight?

1603
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:14,960
If you love someone, let them know.

1604
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:17,360
You should know,
what he thinks about it.

1605
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,160
You didn't even question

1606
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:22,280
and you are waiting for an answer.
How will you know?

1607
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:29,360
Go. Already you guys
waited for so long.

1608
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,600
What is all this, Prabha?

1609
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:10,960
Hello, aunty.
- Son. The girl you love...

1610
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:13,120
Is her name Bhumi?

1611
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:17,560
Yes, aunty.

1612
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:20,080
Did you guys study
in the same college?

1613
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:23,040
How do you know?

1614
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,160
Her love is very pure.
That made Akash come here.

1615
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:47,800
I just helped them be together.

1616
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:51,160
At last, you daughter is
marrying and you are sending her.

1617
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,720
I am not sending
her after the marriage.

1618
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:56,320
She must need someone to guide her.

1619
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,160
You gave me the watch and you left?
You decided you wanted to leave me.

1620
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:03,600
No chance.

1621
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:07,440
However you cut me.

1622
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,000
I was about to go
and meet your parents.

1623
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:13,320
In the mean time aunty
called me and asked about us.

1624
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,760
So, now we are here after that.

1625
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:19,000
When you came here,
why didn't you meet me directly?

1626
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:20,320
Why do you think your client

1627
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,680
kept the meeting in
the hotel where I stay?

1628
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,320
She told she will be coming
but she was not there. Why?

1629
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,440
So, that was all your plan?

1630
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:29,120
You look innocent but you are not.

1631
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:30,520
What can I do?

1632
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,640
I couldn't see your love.
I had to put up an act for that.

1633
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:38,760
You waited for me this long.

1634
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:41,040
I should at least fight this, right?

1635
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:43,760
Hello, I didn't wait for you.

1636
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,760
Just, I didn't connect to anybody.

1637
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:48,640
Why are you laughing?

1638
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:50,560
You didn't have this ego in college.

1639
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,800
You made me like this.

1640
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,880
You didn't even say it yet. - What?

1641
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:00,840
That you like me. - Wait for that.

1642
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,120
How long?

1643
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:05,360
Till that 'Bhumi' (sky)
meets the 'Akash' (land).

1644
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:09,520
I will tell your mom,
she will do it easily.
