1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,068
This is the largest shredder
in the world,

2
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:04,804
and this Lamborghini
is going to fall in it.

3
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:07,807
We're also nuking
an entire life size village,

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:11,378
shooting real tanks
at a literal Lamborghini,

5
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:14,481
and crushing this store
with the world's largest domino.

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,950
This is the first
of many experiments.

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,952
You're going to love this video.
You ready?

8
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,187
- Ready!
- This is going to be crazy.

9
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,089
All right.
They're falling.

10
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,190
Come on.

11
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,459
All right, it's working.

12
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,193
It's actually working.

13
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,528
Are we going to have to run?

14
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,130
You hear the thud?

15
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:32,465
Oh, it's going.

16
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,768
All right, that was the tallest
domino in the world.

17
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,337
That was the new tallest domino
in the world.

18
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,506
Down goes the domino!

19
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,974
Oh, my God!

20
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,246
That was insane!

21
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,548
- That was crazy!
- We were way too close!

22
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,817
This isn't even the coolest thing
we're doing in this video.

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,987
We're detonating the biggest
explosion in YouTube history,

24
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,090
launching a rollercoaster
off its track, and so much more!

25
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,658
Let's go to the next experiment.

26
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,393
We got a lot of experiments today.

27
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,127
And up next,

28
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,129
we're going to destroy
an entire village

29
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,131
with a massive creeper explosion.

30
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:06,166
And just for reference,

31
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,635
a human sized version
looks like this.

32
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,937
- Oh!
- Oh, okay.

33
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,840
But we're going to be detonating
one 50 times bigger

34
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,342
Steve, somehow you survived
the last creeper.

35
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,711
This one… I'm not quite sure
you're going to survive.

36
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,180
We don't believe Steve's
going to make it?

37
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:20,880
Oh, heck no.

38
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:25,085
Even though this is 50 times bigger,
it has 200 times the TNT.

39
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:25,919
Bye, Steve.

40
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,587
- Okay, let's head in the bunker.
- All right, Steve.

41
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,422
Let's send Steve into the abyss.

42
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,591
Just so you know
how big this creeper is,

43
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,493
Steve is actually taller than me.

44
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:34,861
- He's getting close.
- We're in the Green Zone.

45
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,663
This is going to be
a massive explosion.

46
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,597
It's getting closer, any second now.

47
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,032
I don't know
when it's going to happen.

48
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,633
Oh, I'm scared.

49
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,942
Oh, my gosh.

50
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,312
- Oh, my God.
- I'm speechless, for once.

51
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,746
I'm still processing that.

52
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,483
- That was insane.
- How are we allowed to do this?

53
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,751
- We live in a country called America.
- Go, America.

54
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,954
If you thought that was cool,
I got news for you.

55
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,623
It's about to get a whole lot cooler.
For our next experiment,

56
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,258
I bought another Lamborghini.

57
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,061
- Adam, this is your Lamborghini.
- Thank you.

58
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,796
And you're probably wondering,
though, what's the catch?

59
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,231
Yes. That's exactly
what I'm wondering.

60
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,098
How do I put this?

61
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,602
Recently, I may have obtained
a military grade tank.

62
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,137
In exactly three days,

63
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,772
I'm going to be raining
missiles on your new car.

64
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,641
And you get to use my credit card

65
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,776
to spend as much money
as you want trying to defend it.

66
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,979
If the Lamborghini survives,
you have a brand-new car.

67
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,081
I'm going to spend whatever
it takes to defend this Lambo.

68
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,349
That's why I gave you my card.

69
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,750
Okay, fine. I'm going to do it.

70
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,452
A lot of things racing
in my mind right now,

71
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,321
but it's simplified into Stop Shell,
win Lambo.

72
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,057
Adam's first move was to call
a construction crew

73
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,161
to bring in building materials
and help him set up his first wall.

74
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,731
I'm going to want all the walls
to kind of be a foot over my head.

75
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,634
That'll at least protect
the direct shots on the Lambo.

76
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,136
Now for the second part of my process,
it's going to be the pool.

77
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,671
There was a MythBusters episode

78
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,040
where they were
shooting rounds into a pool,

79
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,342
so that should stop
the velocity heavily.

80
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,712
Adams got a lot of work ahead of him
to keep his Lambo from danger.

81
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:00,880
And speaking of danger,

82
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,516
we bought the world's
most dangerous roller coaster.

83
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,052
And if you're
wondering why it's dangerous…

84
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,023
Basically, I put bombs on the ride.

85
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,292
In theory, if you were to ride
this roller coaster,

86
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,993
you should get launched off this rail.

87
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,362
The only question is
where would you land?

88
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,932
Let's see how far it goes
when it gets launched off it.

89
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,734
And obviously, before we launch it,
we're going to put mannequins on it.

90
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,103
Everyone, put your mannequin
where you want.

91
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,506
He's got a good head on his shoulders.

92
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,574
And the final touch.

93
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,476
Push! As hard as you can!

94
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,745
- All right, get out of the way.
- Go! Go! Go!

95
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,280
All right, there it is.

96
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,748
This thing's going fast.

97
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,018
All right. Now, it's going
to come down and go off the ramp.

98
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,086
Here it goes.

99
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,554
Go, go, go.

100
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,132
All right.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

101
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,934
Oh, that actually scared me.

102
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,936
To be honest,
I thought it would go further.

103
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:57,737
That was cool and all.

104
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,771
Let's do that again.

105
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,040
but with an explosive in the cart.

106
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,910
Inside these boxes,
there's dozens of pounds of TNT.

107
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,646
When we're done pushing,
run to the bunker.

108
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,281
You don't have to tell me to do that.

109
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,816
Go, go, go, go. We're going.

110
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,685
All right, I'm running.

111
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:13,853
Go, guys. Go!

112
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,024
- Go quicker.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

113
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,259
Oh, my Gosh!

114
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,495
- Get inside.
- It's going down!

115
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,337
That was awesome!

116
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,040
It might not have flown 100 feet,
but at least we blew it up.

117
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,376
But that explosion
is literally nothing

118
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,044
compared to what you're
about to see.

119
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:40,213
For the next experiment,
we have three safes,

120
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,249
one that costs $1,000, $10,000,

121
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,585
and finally, the $100,000 safe.

122
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,619
It's bigger than me.

123
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,789
And we're going to see
how many explosives they can resist.

124
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,592
These are actual explosives.

125
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:53,993
Why is Chandler bringing them in?

126
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:54,927
He's my dealer.

127
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,663
- Okay.
- Carefully set it down.

128
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,699
I know this doesn't look like a lot,
but this is $1,000.

129
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,701
For however much
we spent on each safe,

130
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,636
we spent the same amount on TNT.

131
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,938
And we're going to see who wins
this $1,000 safe

132
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,540
or $1,000 in explosives.

133
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,342
I'm going to put an egg
inside the safe.

134
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,311
Let's see if it turns
into scrambled eggs.

135
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,548
Usually during explosives,
we have a wireless switch.

136
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,050
This time, it's hardwired.

137
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,084
Why?

138
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,826
That actually scared me.

139
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,495
Well, the egg in the safe
literally don't exist anymore.

140
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,496
Let's try this again

141
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,933
with 10 times the explosives
and a safe 50 times stronger.

142
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:34,634
No joke,

143
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,636
this thing has three-inch-thick steel.

144
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,071
Grab a crate of explosives.

145
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,839
This is like explosive Jenga.

146
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,740
Oh, my gosh.

147
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,775
We're like putting presents
around a Christmas tree.

148
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,610
The last egg did not survive.

149
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,280
Let's see if a $10,000 safe
can protect it.

150
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,248
Is this safe
really worth ten grand

151
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,850
if it can't protect an egg from TNT?

152
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,919
I don't know
if safes are meant to stop TNT.

153
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,655
- This button is hot.
- You want to hit it?

154
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,290
I do. 3, 2, 1, go!

155
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:58,958
Oh!

156
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,199
- What? Oh, my…
- Bro.

157
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,934
The next one is supposed
to be 10 times bigger.

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,634
Than that one,

159
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,570
which was ten times
bigger than the previous one.

160
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,905
Oh, my God.
He put a divot in the ground.

161
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,575
Yo, can you guys believe Nolan's
mom fell right here?

162
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,009
Oh, my God.

163
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,412
It broke the glass
on the hundred thousand safe.

164
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,548
In hindsight, I should've
put the safes further apart.

165
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,917
Ever since we were born,
we've always wondered

166
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,921
if you put $100,000 worth
of explosives around $100,000 safe,

167
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,656
would it protect an egg?

168
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:31,524
The age-old question.

169
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,326
You're in luck
because I'm about to answer it.

170
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,129
So heavy!

171
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,400
This safe is now surrounded
by $100,000 in explosives?

172
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,301
You could say it's unsafe now.

173
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,737
Out of every explosion
we've ever done,

174
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,973
what you're about to see
is the biggest by far.

175
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,742
 Our videos have gone so crazy
that people think we fake them.

176
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,611
This is a real explosion.

177
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,647
Three, two, one.

178
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,260
I don't even have any words.

179
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,897
- We woke up everybody in the city.
- Everybody in the entire state.

180
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,399
Let's see if the egg survived.
Oh, my gosh.

181
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,501
Bro, the back of the safe is gone.

182
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,103
Bro, it broke the foundation.

183
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,304
It's all cracked in the floor.

184
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,539
It seems like they
put all their effort

185
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:23,309
in the 37,000 pound door
and not the walls of the safe.

186
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,777
And the egg did not survive.

187
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,512
If you ever want to rob a bank,

188
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,915
just buy a hundred grand worth of TNT.

189
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,952
in the meantime, Adam had been going
all night building his structure.

190
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,254
It's like 2:00 a.m.,
still so hot out here.

191
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,689
And when I came back in the morning,

192
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,258
I noticed he had some
pretty interesting ideas for it.

193
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,694
Adam!
What am I looking at?

194
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,062
Scrapyard had a lot of cars,

195
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,097
I'm going to have at least
two layers of cars

196
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,466
and I'm probably going to stack them.

197
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,901
The real secret is I'm going to be
using the engine block to stop it,

198
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,570
That should give it
more stopping power

199
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,904
than just the side of a vehicle.

200
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,474
So far, Adam has
two cinder block walls,

201
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,743
two layers of stacked cars
and three pools full of water,

202
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,646
all just to protect
this Lamborghini from the tank's shot.

203
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,748
What do you think the odds are
that the Lambo survives?

204
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,984
That Lambo's mine, baby.
We're going to get it done.

205
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,619
But I wasn't about to go easy on it,

206
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,721
so we brought in extra support
for tomorrow.

207
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,890
Boys! Bring them in!

208
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,759
Oh, my gosh.

209
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,427
Jimmy.

210
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,162
Now that we brought in two more tanks, 

211
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,297
the Lambo will be
targeted from all sides.

212
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,999
Adam doesn't stand a chance.

213
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,134
You have a little less
than 24 hours left.

214
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,402
Good luck, Adam.

215
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,303
You're going to need it.

216
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,906
All jokes aside,
I am actually stressed out about that

217
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,474
If I'd known there were
going to be three tanks,

218
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,276
I would've strategized
completely different.

219
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,478
While you're building,
we're going to go test the tanks.

220
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,412
Oh, great.

221
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,247
Thanks.

222
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,548
Kris. Do you want to do the honors?

223
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,682
- Yeah.
- Too bad.

224
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,520
The test we built consists
of a hundred pound safe,

225
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,890
a trampoline
and bulletproof glass. But…

226
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:48,661
Did it go through it?

227
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,264
Oh, I can literally see through it
from back here.

228
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,366
This is the weakest
of the three tanks.

229
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,367
Adam is screwed.

230
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,435
While Adam was wrapping up
his protection

231
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,537
for his Lamborghini,

232
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,405
we're going to throw one
into a shredder.

233
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,940
And to show you
how powerful it is,

234
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,675
I'm going to shred
some other stuff first.

235
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,478
- Karl, send it.
- Here we go! Yeah.

236
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,746
Let's see what happens.

237
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,248
Oh, yeah!

238
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,683
That is so awesome!

239
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,387
That doesn't sound like piano noises.

240
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,421
Yeah!

241
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,623
I think we need to wash down
that piano.

242
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,258
I agree.
Send the coke.

243
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,494
I'm 99% sure these are going
to blow up.

244
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,262
Oh, there it goes!

245
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,432
And while we're doing this,

246
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,934
I want to tell you guys
about Creator League.

247
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,835
It's a gaming league brought to you
by eFuse

248
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,904
and eight of the biggest
gaming entertainers in the world.

249
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,739
It's like having a front row
season ticket,

250
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,874
but you're not just watching.

251
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,242
You're actively drafting teams,

252
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,511
changing strategies
and sharing in the reward.

253
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,545
Oh, my God.

254
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,914
Up next, we have
a Hershey's vending machine.

255
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,183
I'll do you guys a favor
by getting rid of it.

256
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:44,784
There it goes.

257
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,586
There goes the Hershey's.

258
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,355
Is it stuck?

259
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,791
Turns out not even this
massive shredder

260
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:52,925
can digest Hershey's.

261
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,493
When you purchase
a Creator League pass,

262
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:55,795
you're able to influence the league,

263
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,663
compete at weekly tournaments,
win prizes,

264
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,865
and potentially even meet
some of your favorite influencers.

265
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,901
And if you sign up in
the next seven days,

266
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,003
you'll receive a free box
of Feastables.

267
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,472
I'm grabbing the porta potty.

268
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,208
Who taught Kris how to use this stuff?

269
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,711
Creator League gives you full control
over what games creators play.

270
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,012
Kris, drop it!

271
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,046
Who's on each team,

272
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,182
What are the rules,
and so much more.

273
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,283
Oh, it smells.

274
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,884
We've been in this junkyard
for 10 hours,

275
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,319
and even I took a
poop in that earlier.

276
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,821
One Creator pass equals
one vote,

277
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:22,922
and you have full influence

278
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,724
over almost everything
they do in the league.

279
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,225
Click the link in the description
down below

280
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,727
and sign up for Creator League
right now.

281
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,596
while we clean out this shredder
to get it ready for the Lamborghini,

282
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,598
we're going to go shoot
another one with tanks.

283
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,166
And things aren't looking good
for Adam.

284
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,369
because he was running
into a ton of problems

285
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,903
on his last night of filming.

286
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,106
We're hitting some issues.
We need some things.

287
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,642
Nothing's open, not being able
to get enough resources.

288
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,043
This is my last bricks.

289
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,845
I can't believe we even
got these done.

290
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,847
three tanks is just impossible.

291
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,115
I got to work through
the rest of the night.

292
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,684
I wouldn't forgive myself
if I went to sleep now.

293
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,719
Adam.

294
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:54,820
Hi, Jimmy.

295
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,756
Please tell me
you're not still building.

296
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,124
Can I get five more hours?

297
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,558
Over the last 24 hours.

298
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,794
Adam has managed
to stash 20 more cars,

299
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,696
build four more walls to the sides,

300
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,831
and he also put two more giant pools.

301
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,833
But you went out of your way
to build this pool,

302
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:08,801
but didn't fill it up.

303
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,069
Yup. I ran out of time to fill it up.

304
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,370
You should learn time management.

305
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,538
Yes, I should.

306
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,940
Noticing a lot less cars over here.

307
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,675
Yeah.

308
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,009
Oh, I see you put sand in here.

309
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,544
Does it make it harder to push over?

310
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:19,679
It'll be fine,

311
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,114
Bro, do you just not want the Lambo?

312
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,416
It's going to work.

313
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,150
Okay.

314
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,753
This might be the last time
we see this Lamborghini in one piece.

315
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:28,521
Stay strong.

316
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,822
I'll be back soon.

317
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,291
And I've obtained 20 real tank shells.

318
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,392
Don't ask me how.

319
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,028
And we're not going to stop firing
until we use all of them.

320
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,830
The boys are loading the tanks.

321
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,031
This is going to be awesome.

322
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,866
- Why is mine so small?
- You know why.

323
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,435
The moment of truth.

324
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,604
Are you ready? Three, two, one.

325
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:48,974
Oh. One of my pools.

326
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,042
We got a pool.

327
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,110
No, no, no.

328
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:54,013
Our first shot literally
hit the pool in front of the Lambo.

329
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,748
The water poured everywhere.

330
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,750
How much water did you put in those pools?

331
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,984
Oh, this is gross.

332
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,486
Fire in the hole!

333
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,356
Oh, my God.

334
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:05,825
I'm still holding out faith.

335
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,827
Hey, this one at the same time.

336
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,428
- All three.
- Oh, my God.

337
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,597
Three, two, one.

338
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:16,202
Adam's walls make it impossible
to see the Lamborghini from here.

339
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,636
So until we run out of ammo,

340
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,139
we have no idea if
his car made it or not.

341
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,808
- I felt that one.
- Yeah, this is not good.

342
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,611
Reload the tanks. Kris.

343
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:27,379
Karl.

344
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,215
Nolan.

345
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,084
Your defense is not holding up there.

346
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:32,952
This is not good.

347
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,620
I'm kind of grasping the straws
at this point.

348
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,788
I've done all I can do.

349
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,056
Fire in the hole.

350
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:38,958
I have way too much power.

351
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,392
I was so confident today too.

352
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,931
I love how is just rapid-fire tanks
right now.

353
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,638
My only hope is that they're missing.

354
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,542
Anyways, what were you saying?
Last shot.

355
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,244
Adam, this time
you don't get a choice.

356
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,979
- You have to pull.
- If Imma go down,

357
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,647
Imma go down looking like a G.

358
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:03,916
All right.

359
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,217
Oh, he's running!

360
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,753
Adam's car, it's done for.

361
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,721
I can't see.

362
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:10,756
I can't see.

363
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,625
Let's go!

364
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,726
Come on!

365
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,427
Wait. Are there no holes in it?

366
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,229
- Man, let's go baby!
- You did it!

367
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,031
What's crazy is, even though the cars

368
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,900
aren't strong enough
to stop the rounds,

369
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,368
they were able to deflect them

370
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,602
away from the Lamborghini.

371
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,337
- There's a bullet in the pool.
- Oh, my God.

372
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,806
There's a bullet in the pool.

373
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,108
The pool right
in front of the Lamborghini,

374
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,676
caught a bullet for you.

375
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:31,944
Thank you, MythBusters.

376
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,445
I owe you this,
but Imma keep the Lambo.

377
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,346
Oh, my gosh.

378
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,481
Oh, will he fit?

379
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,683
Hey, he fits!

380
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,919
Hey, we're gonna make it work.

381
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,520
That's fine.
We're gonna make it work.

382
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,622
Congratulations on the Lambo.

383
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,824
Let's go shred another one.

384
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,660
And now, the moment you savages
have been waiting for.

385
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,763
This hunk of metal is going
in the world's largest shredder.

386
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,932
- Is it time?
- It's time!

387
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:53,933
Let's drop it.

388
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,100
Karl, are you ready?

389
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,636
- Ready!
- Send the Lamborghini!

390
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,340
This suspense is killing me.

391
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,442
- Oh, my God.
- It's hanging over the edge!

392
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,277
Oh, my God!

393
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,245
There it goes.

394
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,614
Lamborghini versus
the world's largest shredder.

395
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:09,982
It's about to... Oh!

396
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,754
Yeah!

397
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,957
Look at it.
It looks like it's dancing.

398
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,359
This is the coolest
thing I've ever seen

399
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,027
Bro, our building's shaking.

400
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,232
Oh. The car's fighting back.

401
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,933
I think we need to push it down.

402
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,568
It's stuck in the Lamborghini tires,

403
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,403
so the crane's going to push it down.

404
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,808
Whoa.

405
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,277
Yeah!

406
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,180
Shred the car. Shred the car.

407
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,514
It's doing it.

408
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,683
Oh, my God. All right.

409
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,119
And that is what a shredded
Lamborghini looks like.

410
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,088
Don't worry, it didn't work.
It was decommissioned.

411
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,523
Subscribe, because we have
some insane videos coming up,

412
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,726
and I'd hate for you
to miss them. See you later.
