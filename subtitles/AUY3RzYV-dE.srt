1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,611
13th January 2012,

3
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:04,118
7:15 PM.

4
00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:07,101
The world's largest Italian cruise ship

5
00:00:07,101 --> 00:00:10,096
set sail for its 7-day European tour.

6
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:13,220
This ship was named the Costa Concordia.

7
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:16,648
It was so big that

8
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:19,345
not only was it bigger than the Titanic,

9
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:22,772
but it could seat an additional 2,000 passengers.

10
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,877
That's why 4,252 people are on board.

11
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:28,381
If we talk about entertainment,

12
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:30,464
this ship had everything!

13
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,262
4 big swimming pools, 5 restaurants,

14
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:35,666
13 different bars, a casino,

15
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,659
a basketball court, a huge fitness centre

16
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:41,068
which had a gym, a sauna, a Turkish bath,

17
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:45,297
and even an F1 racing simulator 
was installed on this cruise ship.

18
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:48,485
The first destination of this ship 
was Savona, a city in Italy,

19
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:50,969
it was supposed to take about a day to reach there.

20
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,278
But only 2.5 hours after the ship departed,

21
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:59,104
everyone heard a sudden piercing noise.

22
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:04,794
After that, all the lights on the ship went off.

23
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:07,448
And the ship started tilting towards one side.

24
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:09,552
The time was 9:45 PM.

25
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:13,489
A time when some people were sleeping in their rooms

26
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:16,740
and some were eating at the dinner tables.

27
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,974
Some people who were sleeping woke up

28
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:21,882
and they came out of their cabins 
to see what was happening.

29
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,610
Meanwhile, the plates of the 
people sitting at the dinner table

30
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,156
started sliding down the side of the table.

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,861
Passengers were told via intercom that

32
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:35,994
there was an electrical failure on the ship.

33
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:38,010
But the fact was that

34
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,507
the engine of the ship had failed.

35
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:44,089
The captain of the ship was hiding this fact from the people.

36
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:47,809
After a while, the ship started tilting to the other side.

37
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:49,894
By then, the passengers somewhat realised that

38
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:52,073
this was not an ordinary electrical failure.

39
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:55,943
People were worried that this was 
another incident similar to Titanic's.

40
00:01:55,943 --> 00:02:00,570
Coincidentally, the Titanic accident happened exactly 100 years ago

41
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,002
in 1912.

42
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,785
And now, when this ship had an electrical failure,

43
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:08,960
the famous Titanic theme song 
was playing in the dining hall of this ship,

44
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,847
My Heart Will Go On.

45
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:13,458
Slowly, the ship started tilting more,

46
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,400
It tilted to the right side

47
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,333
and the lower rooms were being filled with water.

48
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,841
By then, people had realized that 
the ship was going to sink.

49
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,432
But why were the passengers not being informed properly?

50
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:26,557
Why was the ship's captain so quiet?

51
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,149
This ship was operated by an 
Italian company called Costa Crociere.

52
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:44,535
Initially, this company operated only cargo ships.

53
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:47,784
But in 1948, they launched their Costa lines.

54
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:52,434
Soon after, it became one of the 
biggest cruise ship companies in Europe.

55
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:56,968
Later, in 2000, a company named 
Carnival Corporation bought it.

56
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,781
So Costa Croisiere became 
a subsidiary company of Carnival.

57
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:04,460
In June 2006, they launched their first ship

58
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,530
of the Concordia class.

59
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,465
The Costa Concordia that we're talking about today.

60
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:12,120
The biggest Italian cruise ship of its time.

61
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,169
The cost of making it was $570 million.

62
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:18,406
â‚¹25 billion at that time.

63
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,120
That day, the captain of this ship was

64
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,896
Francesco Schettino, an Italian man,

65
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:25,859
who had been working for this company since 2002.

66
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,351
Remember his name,

67
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:30,801
because he plays an important role in our story.

68
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:35,081
At 7:18 PM, this ship left for its first destination, Savona.

69
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,238
And only two hours had passed that

70
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:39,861
this ship deviated from its normal route.

71
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:41,280
It was not a mistake.

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,579
Captain Schettino wanted to 
take the ship by a particular island.

73
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,868
The Giglio Island in Italy.

74
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:49,973
He wanted the people of the island

75
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:53,420
to see the glittering ship in the dark of night.

76
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,825
Whenever a ship passes near the land,

77
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:59,830
it is called a sail past or sail by.

78
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,846
Normally, such big ships sail 
at a distance of 7-8 km from the shore

79
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:06,719
well into the sea

80
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,977
because the water needs to be 
deep enough for such a big ship to sail.

81
00:04:09,977 --> 00:04:11,839
But because of this sail-by,

82
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:15,385
this ship was only 150 m away from the shore.

83
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:17,970
Obviously, the water was not very deep.

84
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,498
There can be big rocks or reefs 
under the ship at this close distance

85
00:04:20,498 --> 00:04:22,471
which can hit the ship.

86
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,918
On top of that, it was nighttime

87
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:25,520
and the ship was sailing quite fast.

88
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,441
Later, the report of the Italian Ministry of 
Infrastructure and Transport confirmed this.

89
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:35,489
At night, the ship was sailing at an unsafe 
distance, very close to the shore.

90
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:37,032
One question that will arise here is,

91
00:04:37,032 --> 00:04:38,636
why was the captain doing this?

92
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:40,545
The thing is, Captain Schettino

93
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:45,161
used to work under Senior Captain Mario Palombo.

94
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,380
And Mario was living on the Giglio Island.

95
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,618
The night this ship was passing by this island,

96
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:54,359
that night, Captain Schettino

97
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,299
called Mario and told him that

98
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:58,468
since they would be passing by the island,

99
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:00,551
they would sound a siren for him,

100
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,569
as they wanted to give him a tribute.

101
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:03,916
To this, Mario said that

102
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,511
he was not on the island,

103
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:07,496
instead, he was in another Italian city.

104
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:10,478
During this conversation, the call line gets disconnected.

105
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,631
This call was made at 9:40 PM.

106
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:15,086
And a few minutes later,

107
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:18,606
came the scary sound that I mentioned 
at the beginning of the video.

108
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,140
The thing everyone feared, happened.

109
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,195
This ship collided with the rocks in the water.

110
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:30,895
This collision tore the hull of the Concordia ship.

111
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:36,017
The ship's sensitive part was injured by a 70-meter-long wound.

112
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:37,678
The place where this impact happened

113
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:40,320
was not even 100 meters away from the island.

114
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,885
In the darkness of the night, this ship

115
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:44,077
had reached so close to the island.

116
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,981
Water started flowing into the ship rapidly.

117
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:51,199
26-year-old Andrea Corollo, who was
the third officer of the Concordia ship, 

118
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,249
was sleeping in his cabin when this incident happened.

119
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:56,461
When he woke up and came out of his cabin,

120
00:05:56,461 --> 00:06:00,254
he saw that the water had already reached the hallway.

121
00:06:00,254 --> 00:06:02,515
He immediately ran to the engine room.

122
00:06:02,515 --> 00:06:03,960
When he reach there,

123
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,377
he saw that the door could not be opened.

124
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:08,675
Through the closed door,

125
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:11,724
he could see that the generators and engines

126
00:06:11,724 --> 00:06:14,494
were completely submerged in water.

127
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:15,780
At 9:52 PM,

128
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,384
the chief engineer and the other officers of the engine room

129
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:21,528
tried to start the emergency diesel generator.

130
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:24,728
Unfortunately, they failed in this attempt.

131
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:28,189
The chief engineer went to inform Captain Chettino

132
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,900
about how bad the situation was.

133
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,686
But the captain of the ship 
announced to the passengers that

134
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:35,496
there was nothing to worry about.

135
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,650
That it was a simple blackout.

136
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,290
Over the next few minutes, the ship was not standing still,

137
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,039
rather, it was moving forward,

138
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:01,318
away from the island.

139
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:02,446
At around 10 PM,

140
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:04,007
Captain Schettino felt that

141
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,549
the ship should be turned around.

142
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:09,465
He reasoned that if they sank, it would be 
more dangerous to be in the middle of the sea.

143
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:11,283
It would be better to stay near the island.

144
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:13,162
The ship took a U-turn

145
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:15,207
and thus, instead of being upright,

146
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:17,032
it started tilting to the other side.

147
00:07:17,032 --> 00:07:19,421
First, it was tilting to the left,

148
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:21,767
now it started tilting to the right.

149
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:24,462
The ship's crisis coordinator, Roberto Ferrarini,

150
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:26,822
called Captain Schettino twice,

151
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:30,100
at 10:05 PM and 10:07 PM.

152
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,403
In the second call, Captain Schettino finally acknowledged that

153
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:35,400
the ship had some problems.

154
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,890
But had he admitted these problems sooner,

155
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,178
it would have been better.

156
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:43,045
Turning away from the truth can be very dangerous,

157
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,620
as you will see later in the story.

158
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,554
And this applies to our lives too.

159
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,905
Today, because of AI tools like ChatGPT,

160
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:53,024
millions of jobs are in danger all over the world.

161
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:54,537
The latest studies show that

162
00:07:54,537 --> 00:08:00,567
ChatGPT can give innovative ideas
in a faster and better way than MBA students.

163
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:04,109
It can easily pass law exams and business school exams.

164
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,449
After hearing such news, you can 
either turn away from the truth

165
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,777
or accept the reality.

166
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:14,073
Soon, those who will not be able to use 
these AI tools in their jobs and businesses

167
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:15,200
will lag behind.

168
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,364
And those who will use them from now

169
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:18,689
will get a huge advantage.

170
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:21,290
I use ChatGPT daily

171
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,586
and it has given me a huge boost in my productivity and efficiency.

172
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:27,340
To help you take advantage of it from now on,

173
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,299
I have made a 4.5-hour-long
Master ChatGPT course

174
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:32,326
entirely in Hindi.

175
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:35,352
In this course, I have given practical and actionable advice

176

188
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:06,503
Now, if we get back to our topic,

189
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:08,954
Captain Schettino did admit his mistake

190
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:11,479
but follows it with another act of stupidity.

191
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:14,200
He tried to cover up his mistakes.

192
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,096
He claimed that the blackout

193
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:17,921
caused the accident.

194
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:19,259
He reverses the timeline.

195
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,915
In reality, the accident caused the blackout.

196
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:26,520
In the meanwhile, some distressed 
passengers tried to call the local police.

197
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,266
At 10:12 PM,

198
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:31,566
the Italian coast guard called the ship's captain.

199
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:33,538
Asking him what was happening on the ship.

200
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:36,012
And informing him that passengers of the ship were contacting them.

201
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,439
On the other hand, the captain said 
that nothing devastating had happened,

202
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:44,024
they simply had a blackout.

203
00:09:44,024 --> 00:09:45,560
He told them not to worry.

204
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,727
When this was said

205
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,080
half an hour had already passed since the collision.

206
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,579
Ten more minutes pass

207
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:01,110
and Captain Schettino's finally changed his stance.

208
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,284
After all, how long could he suppress the truth with lies?

209
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:06,205
At 10:22 PM,

210
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,197
Schettino told the radio operator

211
00:10:08,197 --> 00:10:10,226
to call and inform the coast guard

212
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:13,139
that there had been a collision on the left side of the ship

213
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:16,120
and that Concordia needed the help of tugboats.

214
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,355
And that life jackets were handed out 
to the passengers and everyone was safe.

215
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:21,337
Each minute was important here

216
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:25,162
because the ship was gradually tilting more and more.

217
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:27,554
Finally, at 10:33 AM,

218
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:30,466
a general emergency alarm was raised

219
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,567
and the passengers were told

220
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:38,155
to gather in the emergency assembly areas

221
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:40,360
and wait for further instructions.

222
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,796
At 10:48 PM,

223
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:54,631
the ship was tilted 30Â°.

224
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:57,613
More than an hour had passed since the accident.

225
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:59,813
At 10.54 PM,

226
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:02,469
finally, Captain Schettino gave orders

227
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:04,032
to abandon the ship.

228
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:08,489
Think about it, friends.

229
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:12,140
More than 4,200 people were stuck on this ship.

230
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,078
And this ship was tilted by 30Â°.

231
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:17,348
Many of the lower cabins were submerged in the water

232
00:11:17,348 --> 00:11:22,360
and things were strewn about in the upper decks

233
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,918
nothing was in its place.

234
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:27,011
In this situation, the captain had made only one reasonable decision.

235
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:28,539
To take a U-turn.

236
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:30,511
Now, based on this one good decision,

237
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:34,376
the lying egoistic Captain was trying to garner support

238
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:38,519
and wanted people to see him as a hero because of this decision.

239
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,707
Undoubtedly, this decision was needed.

240
00:11:40,707 --> 00:11:43,353
But the rest of his decisions were unreasonable

241
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:44,513
and entirely wrong decisions.

242
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:47,112
On top of that, he was piling up his lies

243
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:50,272
and misguiding passengers on this sinking ship.

244
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:53,011
Later on, our captain did something

245
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:56,054
after which he was thoroughly criticised by the people.

246
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:58,700
As soon as he gave the order to abandon the ship,

247
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,984
there was a huge commotion in Concordia.

248
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,321
Some people had already fled using 
lifeboats before this announcement. 

249
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:11,094
Some of the others were confident that they could swim,

250
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:12,860
so they jumped into the water.

251
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,543
They swam to the island nearby.

252
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:19,054
But after the signal by the captain, chaos ensued.

253
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:22,143
The mob of passengers ran towards the lifeboats.

254
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:28,016
People pushed and shoved one another to get to the lifeboats.

255
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:29,464
One good thing was that

256
00:12:29,464 --> 00:12:31,914
fed up by Captain Schettino's behaviour,

257
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:33,836
some of the crew members

258
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,099
were already rebelling against the captain.

259
00:12:36,099 --> 00:12:38,678
Ten to fifteen minutes before his order,

260
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:41,029
the passengers were taken out of their cabins

261
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:42,613
and put into the lifeboats.

262
00:12:42,613 --> 00:12:44,217
"A steward came over to us

263
00:12:44,217 --> 00:12:45,684
because the key card wasn't working.

264
00:12:45,684 --> 00:12:49,086
And told us, 
"Take your coat, take your life jacket."

265
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:53,179
In the darkness of the night, the ship was slowly falling to the right.

266
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:56,261
A 40Â° tilt, a 50Â° tilt.

267
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:59,200
By this point, the passengers whose cabins were on the right side

268
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,792
had reached the surface level of the sea.

269
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:06,238
So, they could easily jump into the water 
and head towards the island.

270
00:13:06,238 --> 00:13:08,836
But the problem was for those

271
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:10,373
who were on the other side of the ship.

272
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,245
In a tilted ship,

273
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:14,634
how could they find the way out?

274
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:18,817
In the midst of all this, an Indian staff member was also present.

275
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:20,379
Karnaatha Rameshana,

276
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:24,490
the only woman in the 11-member security staff of Concordia.

277
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,330
She later stated how language barriers started to emerge.

278
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,206
Most of the passengers on the cruise ship were Italian

279
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:35,482
but many of the crew members did not know Italian.

280
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,442
On top of that, another problem was that

281
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,517
most of the crew members were not trained for such emergency situations.

282
00:13:40,517 --> 00:13:42,018
They were just service staff.

283
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:43,953
Despite all these problems,

284
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:46,024
some crew members were truly heroes.

285
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:49,786
Karnaatha personally seated a blind woman on a lifeboat.

286
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:53,694
Two other members lifted wheelchair-bound passengers on their shoulders

287
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:55,010
and seated them on the lifeboats.

288
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,893
That night, another Indian crew member was present on the ship.

289
00:13:57,893 --> 00:13:59,155
Russell Rebello,

290
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:01,759
he was working as a waiter.

291
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,073
Before Captain Schettino's order,

292
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:07,208
he was helping the passengers to get on the lifeboats.

293
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:11,397
He kept helping passengers on the sinking ship till the last moment,

294
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:14,287
but unfortunately, Russel was among those

295
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,053
who couldn't save themselves,

296
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:17,426
during this evacuation.

297
00:14:17,426 --> 00:14:20,268
We don't know what happened to him exactly,

298
00:14:20,268 --> 00:14:24,135
but he drowned while helping the passengers,

299
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:25,515
this we know for sure.

300
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:27,788
"Indian waiter Russel Rebello is said to

301
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:30,540
have d!ed after giving up his own life-jacket

302
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,220
to save one passenger

303
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,384
and helping others into lifeboats."

304
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:36,728
On the other hand, there were people like Captain Schettino

305
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:38,573
who, instead of helping the passengers,

306
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:41,096
abandoned the ship at the earliest

307
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:42,295
and went towards the island.

308
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:43,396
"Italian cruise ship captain,

309
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,345
apparently ran for lifeboat,

310
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:46,281
and got off the wreck,

311
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:47,647
while his crew and passengers

312
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:49,524
were still on board fighting for their lives."

313
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:50,954
Yup, you heard that right.

314
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:54,628
The same captain who tried to cover it up with lies,

315
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,235
Wasted an hour before telling the truth to the passengers,

316
00:14:57,235 --> 00:14:59,305
And as soon as he made the announcement,

317
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:02,912
within some minutes, at 11:19 PM,

318
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:04,678
he was among the first crew members,

319
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:06,477
to abandon the ship.

320
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:08,961
Giglio island is like a small village.

321
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:10,219
Not many people live there.

322
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:12,730
This island has a population of only 700 people.

323
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,116
But that night when the incident happened,

324
00:15:15,116 --> 00:15:18,803
some people came out of their homes to see what was happening.

325
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:22,719
As soon as the deputy mayor of this island, Mario Pellegrini came to know that

326
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,499
a ship was sinking,

327
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:29,022
despite being a civilian, he went to the ship to help the people.

328
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:30,686
Without thinking for a minute,

329
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:32,233
he jumped into the lifeboat

330
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:34,541
and went into the sea to help the people.

331
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:38,650
He said that when the ship had completely fallen to the right side,

332
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,939
wells of water were being formed inside the ship,

333
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,429
people were trapped in these.

334
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:44,655
He arranged for a rope

335
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:48,606
and used the rope to rescue the people trapped in the well.

336
00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:50,677
In this early stage of evacuation,

337
00:15:50,677 --> 00:15:54,846
around 2,500 to 3,300 people had safely reached the island.

338
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,446
At 11:38 PM,

339
00:15:57,446 --> 00:16:00,063
around 400 people were still trapped in the ship.

340
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:03,280
The Italian Coast Guard helicopters and fire and rescue services boats

341
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,247
had also arrived to help people.

342
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:08,435
They saved a few hundred people from underwater,

343
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:12,354
but they didn't know how many more people were still trapped in the ship.

344
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:14,262
At 12:42 AM,

345
00:16:14,262 --> 00:16:17,654
the Coast Guard commander, Captain Gregorio De Falco,

346
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:19,584
called Captain Schettino,

347
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:23,345
we have the actual recording of this call.

348
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:23,987
Listen.

349
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:35,626
In his anger, he told Schettino directly

350
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:38,112
that as the captain, he should go back on the ship.

351
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:40,698
He ordered Schettino to go back

352
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:42,243
and find out about the passengers still on board.

353
00:16:49,937 --> 00:16:53,272
He told Schettino that he shouldn't have left his passengers and ran away.

354
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:02,440
Schettino started making excuses

355
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,443
and saying that he couldn't go back.

356
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:16,637
Despite all of this, Captain Schettino did not go back.

357
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:22,185
This is why people started calling him Captain Coward later.

358
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:26,416
On one hand, some brave crew members 
and the Italian Coast Guard team

359
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,358
kept helping people all night.

360
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:32,246
Schettino sat at a safe distance and watched it play out.

361
00:17:32,246 --> 00:17:36,143
When the sun rose the next morning, 
and the ship could be seen properly,

362
00:17:36,143 --> 00:17:41,346
people realised the magnitude of the incident.

363
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:43,694
Look at these photos taken in the morning.

364
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:48,000
Exactly where this collision happened,

365
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,653
you can see that part too.

366
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,229
The sheer size of the collision.

367
00:17:51,229 --> 00:17:53,695
Most of the people had been rescued by morning.

368
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:55,811
Three people had been confirmed d3ad,

369
00:17:55,811 --> 00:17:59,054
but some people were still trapped in the ship.

370
00:17:59,054 --> 00:18:03,261
Meanwhile, the residents of Giglio had found out about this incident

371
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,964
and many locals went to help.

372
00:18:05,964 --> 00:18:08,007
700 people were living on the island,

373
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:09,722
but there were 4,000 people on the ship.

374
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:13,557
The residents opened their homes 
to provide shelter to the passengers.

375
00:18:13,557 --> 00:18:17,127
Elizabeth Nani, who worked in Giglio Tourist Information,

376
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:19,674
reported that all the survivors were in shock.

377
00:18:19,674 --> 00:18:22,280
Some people were suffering from hypothermia

378
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,583
because the water was very cold.

379
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,915
But everyone was desperate

380
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:29,008
and was trying to locate their family members and friends.

381
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:34,192
Schools, churches, and canteens on this island were opened

382
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:36,939
so that the survivors could get a roof over their heads.

383
00:18:36,939 --> 00:18:39,609
They were also given blankets and dry clothes.

384
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:41,851
But on the other hand, the rescue operation was still going on.

385
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,820
It would last for the next 2-2.5 weeks.

386
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,688
The Italian Navy, Coast Guard, Fire and Rescue Service,

387
00:18:47,688 --> 00:18:49,410
everyone had to get involved.

388
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,608
Rescue divers were also needed

389
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:54,360
because the people who were still trapped 
were not able to open the cabin doors.

390
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:56,956
The water pressure on the other side was so high that

391
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:58,961
they remained trapped inside the cabin.

392
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:02,329
On 14th January, a South Korean couple was rescued

393
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:04,789
who were trapped inside their cabin like this.

394
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:07,540
Most of the people who were k!lled in this incident

395
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,895
d!ed because of this.

396
00:19:08,895 --> 00:19:10,728
Trapped inside their cabin

397
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:12,039
they drowned.

398
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,853
Had they been informed on time

399
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,181
their lives could also have been saved.

400
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:19,517
A total of 32 people d!ed in this accident.

401
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,536
The next problem was to remove fuel from the sunken ship

402
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:28,892
and to rescue the ship 
so that it would not remain lying there.

403
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:31,165
When the engineers analyzed the ship,

404
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:34,486
it was declared a constructive total loss.

405
00:19:34,486 --> 00:19:37,116
This meant that there was no chance of saving it.

406
00:19:37,116 --> 00:19:39,534
This ship could not be used again.

407
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:42,779
The only option was to disassemble it

408
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:44,711
and sell its scrap metal.

409
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:48,857
First of all, the ship contained around 1.9 million litres of fuel.

410
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:50,395
It was a fully loaded ship.

411
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:51,807
It had just started sailing.

412
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:53,265
That's why the fuel tank was full.

413
00:19:53,265 --> 00:19:57,179
To extract fuel, an oil barrier was built around the ship.

414
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:00,869
On 12 February 2012, the oil removal process began.

415
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:02,700
Since it was wintertime,

416
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,167
another problem was that

417
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,393
a lot of fuel was in a semi-solid state.

418
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:09,014
So, it was necessary to reheat it

419
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:10,528
before extracting it.

420
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:13,588
After heating it, another tanker ship was used

421
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:17,722
and all the oil was transferred from 
one vessel to the other with a pump.

422
00:20:17,722 --> 00:20:20,281
This process lasted more than a month.

423
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:22,574
This process continued till 24th March.

424
00:20:22,574 --> 00:20:25,139
Now, the next thing was to 
set the ship upright

425
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:28,397
and to relocate it was an engineering project.

426
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:30,289
A steel structure was built in the water

427
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:33,067
so that the ship could be raised once again.

428
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:36,447
Work on this started a year later, in April 2013.

429
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:41,580
After this, huge boxes were placed on the upper side of the ship.

430
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,074
Water was filled in these boxes

431
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:44,617
to make them heavier.

432
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:46,732
Ropes and cables were then used

433
00:20:46,732 --> 00:20:50,132
to pull these boxes as weights.

434
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:53,011
These watertight boxes are called caissons.

435
00:20:53,011 --> 00:20:55,611
15 such caissons were installed in total.

436
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:57,493
On 16th September 2013,

437
00:20:57,493 --> 00:21:00,244
the actual process of straightening the Concordia began.

438
00:21:00,244 --> 00:21:02,064
It took 19 hours to do this.

439
00:21:02,064 --> 00:21:04,390
You can see how this was done.

440
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,908
By using pulling machines, steel structures, and caissons.

441
00:21:07,908 --> 00:21:10,556
The next step was to make the ship float on water.

442
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:12,887
For this, more boxes were used.

443
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:14,485
Caissons were installed on the other side as well

444
00:21:14,485 --> 00:21:16,784
after that water was drained out from the caissons

445
00:21:16,784 --> 00:21:19,031
which caused the caissons to float.

446
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:21,092
And as the caissons started floating

447
00:21:21,092 --> 00:21:23,400
the entire ship started floating with them.

448
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,523
"A sound usually used to warn,

449
00:21:25,523 --> 00:21:27,983
bled out to shout success."

450
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:37,741
500 divers, technicians, engineers, and 
biologists were involved in this process.

451
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:40,355
19 months had passed since the accident

452
00:21:40,355 --> 00:21:42,699
and the cost of rescuing this ship alone

453
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:45,231
was $799 million.

454
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:51,180
To take this ship to the port another ship was used to tow it.

455
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,452
This was done in July 2014.

456
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,814
Till then the total cost of this operation

457
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:02,149
had reached $1.2 billion.

458
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:05,144
But the company still had more such expenses to bear.

459
00:22:05,144 --> 00:22:11,128
It took a lot of effort and money 
to scrap metal from this broken ship.

460
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:13,514
More than 350 people worked on this

461
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:16,508
and this process ended in July 2017.

462
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:18,180
But after rescuing people,

463
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,934
a steady stream of legal cases had begun.

464
00:22:20,934 --> 00:22:27,010
Finally, this company returned the price of each surviving passenger's ticket,

465
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,220
and paid an additional â‚¬11,000 as compensation.

466
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,105
This is around â‚¹1 million per passenger.

467
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:36,049
Apart from this, the families of the deceased passengers

468
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:38,439
were paid an undisclosed amount.

469
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:42,462
The total cost of this disaster for this company

470
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,067
was $2 billion.

471
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:46,549
But you must be wondering,

472
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:48,943
what happened to the captain of the ship?

473
00:22:48,943 --> 00:22:51,833
The guy who was the sole reason behind this incident,

474
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,129
lied to his passengers,

475
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:56,045
and didn't give them timely information,

476
00:22:56,045 --> 00:22:57,615
and when the ship started sinking

477
00:22:57,615 --> 00:23:00,059
he abandoned the ship first and ran away.

478
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,754
Even after the incident,

479
00:23:01,754 --> 00:23:03,852
Captain Schettino's habit of lying didn't go away.

480
00:23:03,852 --> 00:23:05,484
When the case was being tried in court,

481
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,091
he told the court that

482
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:09,658
when the ship was at an angle of 60Â°-70Â°

483
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:12,689
his foot slipped and he fell into a lifeboat.

484
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:15,604
And he, apparently, fell in a peculiar way that

485
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:16,605
he was shipped off.

486
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:19,200
Obviously, no one found this argument believable.

487
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,798
The judge did not believe this at all.

488
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:26,464
In 2017, Captain Schettino was charged with manslaughter

489
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,618
and he was sentenced to 16 years in jail.

490
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:32,838
Moving forward, some more interesting 
facts about Schettino were revealed.

491
00:23:32,838 --> 00:23:36,113
Mario Palombo, whom I had 
talked about at the beginning of the video,

492
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:37,329
who was the senior captain,

493
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:40,869
in 2003, Schettino worked under him.

494
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:45,425
Palombo revealed that Schettino had always been a liar.

495
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:49,330
He said that in many cases instead of admitting his mistakes,

496
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,675
Schettino preferred to lie.

497
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:53,566
That night, it was a matter of chance that

498
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:56,478
there was another ship's captain was onboard the Concordia,

499
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,867
Roberto Bosio.

500
00:23:57,867 --> 00:23:59,829
He was the captain of the Costa Serena

501
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:01,507
but that night he was on Concordia.

502
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:02,957
But unlike Schettino,

503
00:24:02,957 --> 00:24:04,381
he didn't flee the ship.

504
00:24:04,381 --> 00:24:06,864
He kept helping people till the end.

505
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:09,985
And in fact, even before Schettino's official announcement,

506
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:13,275
he had already started evacuating the people.

507
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:14,843
Later, he said,

508
00:24:14,843 --> 00:24:18,033
"Only a disgraceful man would have 
left all those passengers on board.

509
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:21,173
It was the most horrible experience of my life,

510
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:24,071
a tragedy, a heartache that I will always carry with me forever.

511
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,307
Don't call me a hero.

512
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:26,764
I just did my duty.

513
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:28,345
A captain's duty.

514
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:31,530
Actually, this should be the duty of all humans."

515
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,439
Along with the captain, 5 people were arrested.

516
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,423
Especially the high-ranking officers on the ship that night.

517
00:24:37,423 --> 00:24:41,039
Each of them was sentenced to 2 years.

518
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,691
Because the biggest mistake was made by Captain Schettino.

519
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,903
Today, 11 years after this incident,

520
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:49,466
Schettino is serving his sentence in jail.

521
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:52,867
And if you learn anything from this story, it is this.

522
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,840
Never give the captaincy of your ship

523
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,277
to a lying coward

524
00:24:57,277 --> 00:24:59,167
who doesn't know how to admit his mistakes.

525
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:01,456
Leaders who never admit to their mistakes
