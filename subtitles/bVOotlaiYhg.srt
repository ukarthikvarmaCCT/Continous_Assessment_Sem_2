video

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,719
we're going to be looking at the

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,600
differences

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,559
between british english and indian

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:37,360
english

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,680
i grew up in bedfordshire in england but

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,200
i live in cambridgeshire

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,239
and i speak with a modern rp accent

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,399
sometimes with a bit of estuary as well

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,920
and yeah i actually speak with a similar

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,039
accent to lucy's

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,120
um but during the course of this video

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,160
i'm sure you'll be able to hear the

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,120
differences there because i actually

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,239
grew up in london

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,640
and i also have hints of multicultural

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,600
london english

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
and shortened down to emily in my in my

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,879
in my accent too

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,960
and um just to let you know i'm of tamil

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,920
ethnicity

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,680
and we just wanted to also mention you

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,200
know india is such a

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,240
diverse country and the population is

36
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,960
huge there's over one billion people

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,920
living in india

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,200
and just to put that in perspective if

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,119
you kind of compare india to europe

40
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,759
um just the number of nations in europe

41
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,759
and the languages that they speak

42
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,560
you will notice some differences in in

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,200
the indian

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,080
english that you use um so we'd love to

45
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,400
hear

46
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,799
um whether you use any words slightly

47
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,159
differently and we'd love to hear your

48
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,680
thoughts on that in the comments section

49
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,119
yes definitely this is all about

50
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,200
learning and sharing so please do

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,280

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,280
you speak and the words that you use

what i'd love to do is um give you a

54
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,399
taste of what one form of the indian

55
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,600
accent sounds like in when we're

56
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,960
discussing these words so yes

57
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,479
please do so if you give some of the

58
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,000
examples

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,520
yeah i'd love to do that that'd be

60
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,360
really cool cool another important thing

61
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,000
to note

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,960
is that ambu has created a pdf for this

63
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,600
lesson

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,000
with all of the vocabulary differences

65
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,840
and some extra quizzes and interesting

66
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,799

description box to download that for

69
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,320
both

70
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,520
videos okay so the first one is

71
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,280
this one it's a vegetable yeah

72
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,200
i would call this okra we would call it

73
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,680
ladyfingers that's so funny because

74
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,879
ladyfingers

75
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,520
is actually the name of a spongy biscuit

76
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,239
oh really

77
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,400
yes it's kind of the bottom layer of a

78
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,360
tiramisu

79
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,040
sometimes do you like do you like the

80
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,440
taste of lady fingers in touring the

81
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,920
soup

82
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
i mean the vegetable yeah yeah i love it

83
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,200
um

84
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,879
honestly i think it's quite a boring

85
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,879
biscuit yeah

86
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,800
um i think that's really funny i mean

87
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,239
you can see why it's called that can't

88
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:42,640
you

89
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,040
but i've um grown up eating okra lady

90
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,879
fingers and it's got a very slimy

91
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,000
texture to it

92
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,080
but yeah it's using a lot of our dishes

93
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,519
yeah it's not something

94
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,400
that we cook with a lot here but we

95
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,239
absolutely love curries

96
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,800
um i think we've actually named the

97
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,640
chicken tikka masala as our national

98
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,120
dish

99
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,840
it was voted as the british national

100
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,120
dish really that's how much we love it

101
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,159
yeah so the next word we've got for you

102
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,680
is this one

103
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,159
brinjal you call it brinjal brinjal

104
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,680
that's so funny i wonder where that

105
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,879
comes from

106
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,440
we call this aubergine but this is quite

107
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,640
a controversial world

108
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,680
yes that too yes

109
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,000
no this is quite a controversial word

110
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,200
because in american english they call it

111
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,400
eggplant and that's it because eggplant

112
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,599
eggplant eggplant

113
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,760
because the flower bud looks like an egg

114
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,120
have you ever oh i didn't i've never

115
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,159
seen it no no

116
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,920
is that one okay we call it aubergine

117
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,480
brinjal

118
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,319
and brinjal i'm going to start calling

119
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,680
it brinjal i just like calling it

120
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,560
eggplant

121
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,439
eggplant i love the accent all right the

122
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,400
next one

123
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,200
is this it's the ingredient that makes

124
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
up a lot of curries and

125
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,239
i eat it for breakfast a lot um we call

126
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:02,640
it

127
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
yoghurt in indian english it's often

128
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,000
called curd

129
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,439
which is really interesting because kurd

130
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,280
actually has a different meaning i guess

131
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,599
in british english when we imagine curd

132
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,319
yeah do we imagine different consistency

133
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,720
yeah isn't curd like the creamy part of

134
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,120
milk

135
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
exactly yeah in indian english you would

136
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,160
often hear phrases like

137
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
could you add some curd to my dish or

138
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,440
i'm just going to pop out and buy some

139
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,320
curd

140
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,520
and not pop out because i guess pop out

141
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,479
is

142
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,320
saying i'm going to go to the shops and

143
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,240
buy some curd interesting

144
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,680
but like a dessert yogurt so

145
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,440
strawberry-flavored yogurt you wouldn't

146
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,720
say a pot of curd

147
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,560
no i don't think he would know okay yeah

148
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,720
interesting the next one we've got is a

149
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,160
really interesting one because i've

150
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,240
grown up hearing it all the time and

151
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,919
it's often been a source of

152
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,600
argument in the household this one is

153
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,800
luck or lack okay yeah

154
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,320
so we don't have a picture for this one

155
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,960
because i need to guess what it is

156
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,440
lark luck like a lark but it's not it's

157
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,160
not spelled with a

158
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,280
r it's spelled l a k h okay

159
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,479
something to do with luck nope something

160
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,479
to do with the bird

161
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,479
it kind of sounds like it right so one

162
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,680
lakh is

163
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,479
a unit in the indian numbering system it

164
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,720
actually represents a hundred thousand

165
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,479
in conversation you might hear someone

166
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,160
say i bought that house

167
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,560
for 10 lakhs so that would be a million

168
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,639
pounds yeah exactly because 10 times 100

169
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,840
000 is 1 million right i just think also

170
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,199
it's amazing the way you can switch

171
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,400
between those two acts

172
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,240
thank you so does that is that maybe

173
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,960
because

174
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,000
rupees are a smaller value

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,840
so you're more likely to have something

176
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,199
perhaps because we would

177
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,360
a hundred thousand pounds a lot

178
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,320
absolutely

179
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,000
yeah that could be that could be a

180
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,520
viable um

181
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,199
reason i think there might be a

182
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,720
difference in the numbering systems as

183
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,039
well

184
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,360
across across the different nations so

185
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,080
that will

186
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,680
influence how we think about numbers

187
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
and then the term that we attribute to a

188
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,280
particular sum of

189
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,919
money or a particular number amazing

190
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,759
because i just would have no idea

191
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,840
if someone yeah told me ten luck in my

192
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,600
household when we're talking about

193
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,319
numbers

194
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,600
um my parents always use blacks

195
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,639
and my siblings and i we use a hundred

196
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,240
thousand or a million

197
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,240
and we often have miscommunication when

198
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,759
we're when we're talking about numbers

199
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,440
it leads to a lot of confusion in the

200
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,639
household

201
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,520
even within your own household yeah all

202
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,960
right this next one

203
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
i wonder if you can tell what it is from

204
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,080
the picture

205
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,919
in british english we would refer to

206
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,080
this as marriage

207
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,520
now you would often hear this being

208
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,600
referred to as an alliance

209
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,080
um sounds really formal doesn't it

210
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,440
forming in an artist yes

211
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,400
um but yeah that's often a term that

212
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,080
would you also use marriage as well yeah

213
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,800
for sure

214
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,680
um but in terms of an example sentence

215
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
uh someone could say

216
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,479
that these two people are seeking an

217
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,080
alliance or they're looking for an

218
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,039
alliance

219
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,240
that's so funny because i would think

220
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,080
that would be a business person

221
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,880
looking to join forces with someone else

222
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,120
when actually it describes an emotional

223
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,520
connection and an official one as well

224
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,720
let us know if

225
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,319
marriage is often referred to in a

226
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,840
different way

227
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,520
from the part of india that you're from

228
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,039
so uh the next one

229
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,199
is you know when it's a rainy day and

230
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,120
you just want to catch that bus you're

231
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,000
going to be waiting at

232
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,720
a bus how would you say it a bus stop

233
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,599
bus stop

234
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,240
in indian english you often hear it as

235
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,960
bus

236
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,400
stand or a bus halt it makes sense

237
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,280
yeah holt is kind of a more formal word

238
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,680
yeah

239
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,479
like a more old-fashioned word for stop

240
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:42,960
in

241
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,879
british english and then a stand well

242
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,319
you stand there don't you

243
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,639
so yeah and i guess they're maybe

244
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,800
referring to the actual stand of the

245
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,080
the pole of the bus signs on the top

246
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,400
right the signage if i heard bus stand

247
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,240
i'd know exactly what is meant by it

248
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,800
absolutely

249
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,960
but we definitely tend to say bus stop

250
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,160
yeah okay

251
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,560
this next one is the word we use to

252
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,520
address

253
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,479
a man in a position of authority for

254
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,000
example a teacher

255
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,520
or your boss i mean in british english

256
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,240
we would just say first name terms for

257
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,039
boss

258
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,680
or mr and then their surname for a

259
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,319
teacher

260
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,199
i remember mr purdum was my favorite

261
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,800
teacher at school so i would

262
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,360
just call him mr purdum or mr yeah

263
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,160
that's absolutely right

264
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
in london i've you know grown up calling

265
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,440
my teachers mr

266
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,240
mr smith for example in india you would

267
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,839
refer to your male teacher as

268
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,320
sir and that's quite common place and

269
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,000
your boss as sir as well

270
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,560
um so with the accent it sounds

271
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,519
something like this

272
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,560
sar so you would hear an indian person

273
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,399
saying saar can you please help me with

274
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,120
the homework please

275
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,640
sorry i was just so in love with what

276
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,720
you were saying i really

277
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,600
really like the accent it is just so

278
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,040
gentle isn't it like

279
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,120
it's almost like caressing the r sound

280
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,480
we do use the word sir

281
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
we do don't we but i would say for a

282
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,240
boss it's too formal that's always

283
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,000
showing too much inequality i would

284
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,720
think

285
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,920
um but in some schools it depends on the

286
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,120
school's regulations

287
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
maybe some private schools places like

288
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
that would insist on a more formal code

289
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,959
yeah that's true but i never had to call

290
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,800
my teachers sir at school

291
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
um what about female teachers females um

292
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
so we so in british english we would say

293
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
madden wouldn't in a really formal

294
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,040
setting i'm just wondering whether sir

295
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,080
madam is used in india because in an

296
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,560
email you would say dear sir madam

297
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,240
in indian english we would refer to a

298
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,680
male teacher as

299
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,640
sir how do you guys refer to your female

300
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,200
teachers at school or your female boss

301
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,560
yeah that would be really interesting to

302
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,880
know because we say miss or mrs

303
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
depending if they're depending on if

304
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,080
they're married or not

305
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,399
yeah i'd like to know that the next one

306
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,480
is all about how you refer to members of

307
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,120
our family

308
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,160
so lucy if i was to say that i met up

309
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,440
with my brother

310
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,000
yesterday what how would you understand

311
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
that that you met up with your male

312
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,079
sibling

313
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,640
my male sibling who is my immediate my

314
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,240
immediate sibling right yes has the same

315
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,519
parents

316
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,320
in indian english brother could also

317
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,800
mean

318
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,519
my male cousin interesting so you do you

319
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,600
use the word cousin still

320
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,040
no so this is why when we speak to

321
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,880
a person who's speaking with british

322
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,360
english we would have to clarify that

323
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,519
and say cousin brother

324
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,399
even though it means cousin you would

325
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,200
often hear

326
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
in indian english someone referring to

327
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,279
their cousin as their cousin brother

328
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,040
interesting well we would just say

329
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,399
cousin

330
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,440
yeah or cousin sister if it was a female

331
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,920
okay yeah yeah it's just the same for us

332
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,040
cousin

333
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,959
okay the next one is this

334
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,079
in british english we say boot or car

335
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:52,880
boot

336
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,000
yeah in indian english we say dickie

337
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,880
so could you put the luggage in the diki

338
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,680
or could you

339
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,839
could you lend me a hand and put the

340
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,839
luggage in there dicky please

341
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,680
awesome and we've also seen a couple of

342
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,880
other spellings for it like

343
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,680
digi as well i guess it just depends on

344
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
the pronunciation i guess so as we

345
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,240
mentioned earlier lots of different

346
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,760
indian accents so i guess that's what

347
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,200
influences the spelling there

348
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,760
yeah and um again this is another word

349
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,600
that is also different in american

350
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,079
english

351
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,000
they call it a trunk they do don't they

352
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,760
i've always imagined an elephant

353
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,720
trunk when i write drunk so they don't

354
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,640
want to put any luggage up there yeah

355
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,240
oh god that's not the first trick ever

356
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,760
so the next one that i wanted to

357
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,920
introduce you to is how we use the word

358
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,560
current

359
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,600
in our day-to-day life okay if i said

360
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
current what would you understand that

361
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,760
tyson

362
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,320
current is in in the moment that is a

363
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,920
good homophone isn't it um

364
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,959
yes the current for it it is

365
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,720
in the current moment in the current

366
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,519
moment lucy and i are filming

367
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,800
but this version of current is used in

368
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,839
day-to-day life

369
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,600
for something else do you want to take

370
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,959
and take a guess

371
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,040
current as in like an ocean current or

372
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,480
electricity current

373
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,519
yes so we use the word current to

374
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,000
replace

375
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,240
electricity i could advise you be

376
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,519
careful of the current lucy

377
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,120
when you are plugging in the plug into

378
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,959
the the socket be careful of the

379
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,800
electricity yes perfect

380
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
awesome i never knew that the next one

381
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,399
is a word used to describe

382
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,920
an illness yeah in british english we

383
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,399
say

384
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,040
diabetes and in indian english you could

385
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,200
hear this being referred to as

386
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,279
sugar and this is commonly used in the

387
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,519
state of tamil nadu

388
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,160
interesting and is this because diabetes

389
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,399
or some forms of diabetes are brought on

390
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:40,720
by

391
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,120
excess consumption absolutely absolutely

392
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,320
very interesting and how do you

393
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,279
pronounce it again

394
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,480
so i would pronounce this as sugar so um

395
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,639
do not eat too many sweets because you

396
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,240
could develop sugar

397
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
interesting the next one we've got on

398
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,279
the screen in

399
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,440
indian english it could be referred to

400
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,560
as the washroom

401
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,880
but it could also be referred to as the

402
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
toilet too

403
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,320
but what about british english well we

404
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,639
also say toilet um i know that's

405
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,399
something that in american english they

406
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,079
find a bit disgusting because it's too

407
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,079
specific to the actual toilet

408
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,360
but we say the toilet or the loo that's

409
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,000
slang

410
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,160
i always say the lou i think i heard you

411
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,040
call it

412
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,639
yeah yes i don't think washroom is that

413
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,240
common but that's not to say it's never

414
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,680
used in british english

415
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,399
that's right yeah the next one is this

416
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,120
one

417
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,959
in british english we call it crisps

418
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,440
i know that's quite a hard sound that's

419
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,199
sound crisps

420
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,959
what's what do you call it in indian

421
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,880
english chips it's commonly referred to

422
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,079
as chips chips

423
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,800
and what about fried potatoes that are

424
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,360
served

425
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,279
warm ah also chips

426
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,560
yeah i guess everything's yeah so the

427
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,920
next one we've got here

428
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,600
is referred to as capsicum

429
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
now how would you refer to it we would

430
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,959
call this peppers or

431
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,959
red pepper green pepper yellow pepper

432
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,720
but then surely that gets confusing the

433
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,079
kind of the pepper that you put on

434
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,720
your fish and chips yes but then the

435
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,920
pepper we put on

436
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,120
like as a seasoning is an uncountable

437
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,600
noun

438
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,000
so i'd say can i have some pepper okay

439
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,800
that would be the

440
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,560
the spice or it's not necessarily a

441
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,000
spice the seasoning

442
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,120
if i ask for a pepper i'm asking for a

443
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,360
capsicum that is a fantastic tip

444
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
so that's the end of the first part of

445
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
