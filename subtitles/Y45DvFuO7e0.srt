1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,828
Every year, over
200,000 children

2
00:00:02,853 --> 00:00:04,820
are born without
the ability to smile,

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,090
and even worse,
breathe properly.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,404
99% of people
are born like this,

5
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:12,762
with a full ability to breathe
through their nasal airway passage.

6
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:15,021
However, the
other 1% look like this,

7
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:16,558
with a cleft lip or palate

8
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,193
which makes
life terribly difficult

9
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,602
for these children
as they grow up.

10
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,326
In poorer areas, there is no
way for many of these people

11
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,225
to get healthcare,
meaning thousands of them

12
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,039
grow up without ever having the
opportunity to receive surgery,

13
00:00:27,064 --> 00:00:29,756
which results in bullying
and social isolation.

14
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:31,500
But, there is
one organization

15
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:34,968
that is making a big difference in
communities all around the world.

16
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:35,952
Meet Kathy.

17
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,623
40 years ago,
my husband and I

18
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:40,632
were asked to
go to the Philippines.

19
00:00:40,657 --> 00:00:43,639
We landed in
sites one after the next,

20
00:00:43,664 --> 00:00:48,648
and we saw 300 children
with cleft lip and palates.

21
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,258
We just didn't
know what to do

22
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,593
We said, let's do
what we can,

23
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,219
and we
were able to do 40.

24
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,823
The rest,
we had to turn away

25
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:56,582
So, we said
to ourselves,

26
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:58,725
okay, well, we
should go back.

27
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,143
We should
at least finish.

28
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,972
This was the
start of Operation Smile

29
00:01:01,997 --> 00:01:03,379
and in
40 years,

30
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:05,886
they've been able to
achieve over 400,000

31
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:09,042
successful surgeries
for patients in 36 countries

32
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:10,195
all around the world.

33
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,946
However, in Mexico,
the number of

34
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,990
cleft cases are
quickly increasing and

35
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,950
becoming difficult
to maintain alone.

36
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,619
They desperately
need our help.

37
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,953
So, Darren
and Dan flew to

38
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,289
Puebla, Mexico,
a city with rich

39
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,800
Latin history and culture.

40
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:25,864
On their arrival, Dan got the rare
opportunity to showcase

41
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:28,448
this incredible city from above
by being invited

42
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:30,507
to ring the cathedral
bell at first light.

43
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,356
They were
welcomed by Mauricio.

44
00:01:51,286 --> 00:01:53,543
I started with
Operation Smile 11 years ago.

45
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:54,405
One of the reasons

46
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,932
why I wanted to
dedicate my life into nonprofits

47
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:58,036
is because in Mexico,

48
00:01:58,061 --> 00:01:59,622
there's a huge gap
between people

49
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:02,114
that can actually have
access to any surgery.

50
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:04,707
I met a
young lady,

51
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:07,262
and when she came to one of our
surgical programs,

52
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:08,622
she had a bruised eye.

53
00:02:08,786 --> 00:02:10,106
They threw
stones at her

54
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:11,381
because of the way she spoke.

55
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,382
It just broke my heart.

56
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,759
This is one of
the consequences of a cleft

57
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,690
I always say
that behind the patient,

58
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:17,457
there's a story,

59
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:19,264
and behind the story,
you have a human.

60
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,332
And I decided
to dedicate my life

61
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:22,892
to the cleft
cause in Mexico

62
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:26,121
We met a young child,
and he is one of the sweetest kids

63
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,814
I've ever
met in my entire life

64
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,130
But he has a terrible
disfigurement on his face.

65
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,069
And this
child is so sweet

66
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:33,997
and so loving,

67
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,240
but it breaks my heart knowing
the bullying that

68
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,534
he is going to face as
he grows up.

69
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,286
One of these
patients is Emmanuel.

70
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,414
17 months ago, he was born
with a bilateral cleft palate.

71
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,790
He is the
son of Jerónimo,

72
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,167
a single father
who lives in

73
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,668
the rural
mountains of Chiapas.

74
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,878
The cost
of health care has

75
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,847
proven to be
extremely expensive for him,

76
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:54,424
as he barely makes enough
money to support his son.

77
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,678
Meaning that his only hope
is to travel by bus for 17 hours

78
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,971
to Puebla for the only

79
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,931
chance of being
selected for a surgery.

80
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,833
And if not selected, it may be
the last chance Jerónimo

81
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:06,769
has to get this
opportunity for his son.

82
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,722
If you look out at any one

83
00:03:08,747 --> 00:03:11,191
of these programs,
what we see are masses.

84
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,527
It's not like
10 children, 2 children.

85
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,654
It's masses of
kids and families.

86
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,114
We screen
these families.

87
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,866
You know,
we look in their face.

88
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,747
But if you
look down,

89
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:23,369
you see no
shoes on their feet.

90
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,288
They will do
anything for their child.

91
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,248
I can only
imagine the pain

92
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,750
for a parent
when they have

93
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,003
a child that desperately needs a
surgery and they cannot afford

94
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,591
to provide it for
them themselves.

95
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,441
And when
we saw just how difficult

96
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,716
this was for these families,

97
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,176
we knew
we had to help.

98
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,844
So we decided
to pay for

99
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,262
over 100 surgeries.

100
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,515
The next day after the screening
process was complete, it was time

101
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,850
for the patient selection.

102
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,988
Jerónimo was extremely
anxious because

103
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:50,355
he wasn't sure if his
son would be selected

104
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,316
Today is a very
emotional day for me.

105
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,269
Behind me, we
have the patients

106
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:56,878
and we're going to do
the surgical announcement.

107
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,821
They are about just to be told

108
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,864
that they're
going to be having

109
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,366
a life change forever.

110
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:11,886
97 patients had
already been selected

111
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:13,878
and Jerónimo
started to lose hope.

112
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,544
It was time
for patient number 99.

113
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,266
He did it.

114
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,017
Just look at
the relief on his face.

115
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:34,347
Seeing the hope in these parents'
faces when they bring these children

116
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:36,150
to this clinic,
knowing that they're

117
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,568
finally going
to get the medical

118
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:41,823
care that they need is truly an
experience that moves the heart.

119
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,366
Emmanuel's surgery
would take the whole day

120
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,849
So while the
doctors operated,

121
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:46,452
Dan and Darren
went to explore the city.

122
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:48,800
We were walking
through the park

123
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:50,039
and we just
found a Mariachi band.

124
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:53,001
And it's always
been a dream of Darren's

125
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,661
to join a Mariachi band.

126
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:57,105
So hopefully I can make his
dream come true.

127
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,646
Sorry!

128
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,318
My friend over there,

129
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,552
he wants to join the band.

130
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:03,239
Okay.

131
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,304
I got you a hat.

132
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,233
I think we have
to shut this down.

133
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:18,114
This is terrible.

134
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:24,424
That was one of the
greatest experiences of my life.

135
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:26,692
That shows you how
boring Darren's life is.

136
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:34,256
Emmanuel's surgery
is now complete.

137
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:35,660
And this
will be the first time

138
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:37,808
Jerónimo will
ever see his son smile.

139
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,505
One of my
favorite moments in

140
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,998
the surgical
program is when

141
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:42,508
the kid comes out of surgery.

142
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,843
Because this
is the first time

143
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,794
that the parents are going to
see the kids with the surgery.

144
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:49,505
It's just such
an emotional moment.

145
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,951
Because you change the life,
not only of the patient,

146
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,646
but the family and the society.

147
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,042
Our patients
are going to have

148
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,591
the opportunity to
actually have a normal life.

149
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:04,113
A healed cleft
means that all

150
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,323
of these children
will grow up

151
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,033
not having to worry
about being bullied.

152
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,848
And on top
of these extraordinary surgeries

153
00:06:08,873 --> 00:06:12,413
Operation Smile also provides
all of their patients with free speech

154
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,693
and vocal therapy.

155
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:16,599
Meaning that they will learn
how to speak clearly and fluently.

156
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,714
But we had one
more surprise left.

157
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:24,111
Kathy told us about a young nursing
student, Fernanda, who was treated

158
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:26,563
by Operation Smile
17 years ago.

159
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:28,378
I knew I wanted
to study nursing

160
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:30,947
because I wanted
to help kids like me.

161
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:32,339
When you go home

162
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,597
You tell your family, that they
don’t have to pay for you anymore.

163
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,464
We’re gonna give
you a full scholarship

164
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:39,987
And we’ll pay for you
to finish your nursing school

165
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:42,465
I think you’re going
to be an excellent nurse.

166
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:47,177
- Thank you.
- Thank you vey much.

167
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:52,276
Dan, come over here.

168
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,644
Alright, look
at this man.

169
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:55,332
If you don't subscribe,

170
00:06:55,357 --> 00:06:57,066
he will literally cry right now.

171
00:06:58,286 --> 00:06:59,621
Don't worry, they subscribed,
so you don't have to.

172
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:00,723
Yeah.

173
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:02,886
Just end it like that.

174
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:05,760
And one more thing.

175
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,244
Operation Smile
is amazing

176
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:10,054
and they're doing incredible
work all around the world.

177
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,288
We want to
