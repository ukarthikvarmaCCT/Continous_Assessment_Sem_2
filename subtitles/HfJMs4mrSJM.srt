1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,696
- Today, we will be testing

2
00:00:01,696 --> 00:00:03,480
the world's greatest experiments,

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,230
like lava versus ice.

4
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:07,707
What?

5
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:08,840
Safe versus lava.

6
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,648
The safe is on fire.
Clock versus rock.

7
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:19,246
Kite versus Maverick.

8
00:00:19,246 --> 00:00:21,246
Be a Maverick.

9
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:24,430
Lava versus ice cream.

10
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,521
All right, I'm about to be a Maverick

11
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:27,347
and move some molting hot lava.

12
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:28,771
This could end really bad.

13
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:29,604
- All right. Come straight this way.

14
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:32,295
Now come on.

15
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:33,128
- Boom.

16
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:34,003
- Oh my God.
- I just move

17
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:35,324
molting hot lava.

18
00:00:35,324 --> 00:00:36,157
- Be careful, that's

19
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:37,796
- Now we're gonna pour
this lava that I move.

20
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:41,658
- Oh, that was really cool.

21
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:43,613
- Wow. Wow.

22
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:46,879
See that?
- Oh.

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,565
Why is the ice cream on fire?

24
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:50,139
- Lava versus Legos.

25
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:52,261
We're gonna see if this
impenetrable fortress.

26
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,561
can withstand lava.

27
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:54,463
- Ah, that's hot.

28
00:00:54,463 --> 00:00:56,010
- Will Smith would approve.

29
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,676
- Ah.
- Know what else is hot?

30
00:00:57,676 --> 00:00:58,902
- What?
- Parent merch.

31
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:00,296
- Loganpaul.com/shop

32
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:02,429
Ouch.

33
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,619
- Oh, wow. That was hot.

34
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:04,887
- Oh, dude.

35
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:06,204
- Oh, our fortress. No.

36
00:01:06,204 --> 00:01:07,531
- Oh my God. That's hot.

37
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:09,276
- Oh, my goodness. Fire stays right there.

38
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:10,598
- And she's on fire.

39
00:01:10,598 --> 00:01:12,246
- Trumpet versus chili.

40
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:15,438
Play me a song.

41
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:17,068
No. I need something more chill.

42
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,459
My Maverick hoodie enjoyed.

43
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:23,092
- Doctor versus apples.

44
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:28,758
All right. Well, a hundred
apples keep the doctor away.

45
00:01:28,758 --> 00:01:31,416
- Oh, wait, hold on.
Just for good measures.

46
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,999
Hit.
- Ah.

47
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:35,790
- UMG versus me.

48
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,398
- Hey, did you get the
horses for that video?

49
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:40,315
- Yeah, the horses are in the .

50
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:42,675
Yo, do you remember? .

51
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:44,463
You've been staring at
the sun for a while.

52
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:46,756
You must have the eye of the .

53
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:48,527
- Chris versus mirror.

54
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:50,119
- Ah, beautiful.

55
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:51,988
Now I can look at myself all day.

56
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:55,732
I guess I'm ugly.

57
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:57,293
- Lava versus microwave.

58
00:01:57,293 --> 00:01:59,651
The hot pocket's cold. It needs some heat.

59
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:05,592
Think we might have
overcooked the hot pocket.

60
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:06,592
- Oh, it should be fine.

61
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:07,425
- My hot pocket.

62
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:08,559
- Lava versus phone.

63
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,392
Cool. Cool.

64
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:10,355
Don't call this phone again.

65
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:13,431
Burn it.

66
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:15,448
- Oh, fuck .

67
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:16,281
Table.

68
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:17,338
- Now we don't have to
worry about the FBI.

69
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,316
We're good.

70
00:02:18,316 --> 00:02:19,805
- Oh, man. We lost him.

71
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:22,014
- Miracle whip versus miracle whip.

72
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:23,404
Are you sure this is gonna work?

73
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:24,860
- Trust me. I'm a doctor.

74
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:27,334
How are you feeling?

75
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:28,167
- It still doesn't work.

76
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:29,697
- All right. Well, let me try my miracle

77
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:31,066
whip.

78
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,536
- Oh, wow. It works.

79
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:36,044
But now I have cancer.

80
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:37,175
- Those are the side effects.

81
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:38,941
- Chandler versus poop.

82
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:39,907
The toilet's clogged.

83
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:43,658
I need a plunger.

84
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:47,576
The plunger is gone.

85
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:48,715
- Lava versus steak.

86
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:50,370
How would you like your steak done?

87
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,203
- Well done.

88
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:53,086
- Like, well, well-done?

89
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:54,102
- Yeah, pretty well-done.

90
00:02:54,102 --> 00:02:55,502
- Bring the lava.

91
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:56,335
- Lava?

92
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:04,133
- Here you go, Chan-chan.

93
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,827
- Lava versus toilet.

94
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:07,186
So what's gonna happen to the toilet?

95
00:03:10,328 --> 00:03:11,161
- Right through it.

96
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:13,031
- Old man, standing outside our store

97
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,039
versus Chandler.

98
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,267
- Is that your wife?

99
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:22,489
- Can a stop sign stop lava?

100
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:23,635
- He's pouring it.

101
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:24,879
- I told it was gonna happen.

102
00:03:26,772 --> 00:03:28,714
- It's a is out of
there. Get back in there.

103
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:29,547
- That's hot.

104
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:30,380
- That's too hot.

105
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,213
- That's hot.

106
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:32,691
- All right. So, if you're
ever driving down the road,

107
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:34,870
you see lava, grab a stop
sign, use it as a shield.

108
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,703
You're welcome.

109
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:36,818
- Wow. That's real smart.

110
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:38,751
- Baseball bat versus coconut.

111
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:48,127
Are you okay?

112
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,171
- I did not expect it.

113
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:51,624
- Coconut shards in my neck

114
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:52,513
- Can you confirm,

115
00:03:52,513 --> 00:03:54,413
let's not use coconuts.
- Oh. Oh my God.

116
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:56,309
Why? I'm a Maverick, we do it different.

117
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:57,142
- Okay.

118
00:03:57,142 --> 00:03:58,792
- Safe versus lava.

119
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:01,210
A Maverick would get the code right.

120
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,181
- You know what a Maverick will do though?

121
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:04,097
- What?

122
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:05,014
- Use lava.

123
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:10,958
- The safe is on fire.

124
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:11,791
- I don't think...

125
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,657
what was in the safe?

126
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:15,312
- More Maverick merch.

127
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:17,942
- Donuts.

128
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:20,125
Oh, this isn't a skit. I'm just hungry.

129
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,742
- Charger versus lava.

130
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:23,974
So in case in Enemy Nation dropped an EMP

131
00:04:23,974 --> 00:04:24,807
and there's no electricity.

132
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,831
I wanna see if I can
charge my phone using lava.

133
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:27,977
Am I gonna get electrocute?

134
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,259
- No. You're good. You're good.

135
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,990
- There's literally no...

136
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,084
- That's what I'm saying.

137
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:34,246
- All right. Now, plug it in.

138
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:37,042
- All right. So look at this.
This phone is not charging.

139
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,042
Let's see if it charges.

140
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:41,882
- Whoa.

141
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,392
- It didn't work. Not charging.

142
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:45,299
Whoa. Don't do that.

143
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:47,051
- Explorers versus Dora.

144
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:48,673
- That was a great expedition boys.

145
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:50,083
- Yeah. We're explorers now.
- Yeah.

146
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,824
- Did you just say explorers?

147
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,651
- Soy, Dora. Which one of
you is the main explorer?

148
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:55,484
- That'd be me.

149
00:04:57,834 --> 00:04:59,942
I'm a Maverick. Get off of me.

150
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:01,400
- Lava versus glass.

151
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,936
Now we're gonna try to
pour some shots of lava.

152
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,258
Oh, God. That's so hot.

153
00:05:05,258 --> 00:05:07,887
I got you. Chandler, I will protect you.

154
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:12,326
- Oh, fuck. That was cute.

155
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:13,545
- Yeah.

156
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:15,199
Can I down my shot?

157
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,555
- The glass kind of cracked.

158
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:18,226
- Chandler versus challenges.

159
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:22,187
Last person to speak wins
$50,000. Starting now.

160
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:24,677
- What? What'd he say?

161
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:26,426
- Lava versus candle.

162
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,088
Do you have a lighter Jake?
- I do not, man.

163
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:29,162
- Do you have a lighter?
- No.

164
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:29,995
- Do you?
- Nah.

165
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,169
Just give it to me.

166
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:33,002
- Okay.

167
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:36,535
- Chris, do your thing.

168
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:39,936
Oh.

169
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:41,596
- Where y'all going?
- Away.

170
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:45,229
- Guys, now we have a nice, fresh scent.

171
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:47,684
- PS4 versus Xbox One.

172
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:49,784
So being a Maverick
and doing it different,

173
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,371
and my car battery died.

174
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:53,200
So I'm gonna keep
innovating like a Maverick

175
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,089
and charge my car battery with a console.

176
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,859
- Come on. It's not rocket size.

177
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:59,259
- All right, Jake. Is it starting?

178
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,391
- No.
- Okay.

179
00:06:00,391 --> 00:06:03,869
All right. Let's see if
a PlayStation 4 work.

180
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:06,523
Is it starting?

181
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:07,883
- Hey.
- Oh, it works.

182
00:06:07,883 --> 00:06:09,282
They don't call PlayStation,

183
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:11,494
the console of the Maverick for nothing.

184
00:06:11,494 --> 00:06:12,956
- Lava versus ice.

185
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,712
- Chris it's just, hold it.

186
00:06:14,712 --> 00:06:15,682
Yeah.

187
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:16,515
It's starting to get

188
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:18,305
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my goodness.

189
00:06:18,305 --> 00:06:19,388
- What? Whoa.

190
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,165
Take it.
- All right.

191
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:25,929
- Idiots versus safe.

192
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:27,732
Pour the lava right here.

193
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,039
- Oh, it's moving.
- What?

194
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,273
- Uh-oh.
- I got nothing else, chief.

195
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:34,604
I'm out of lava.

196
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:35,785
- Attempt number one. Didn't quite work.

197
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:36,894
My wallet still stuck.

198
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:38,192
We're going for round two.

199
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:39,540
- We're gonna try the lock this...

200
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,373
Oh.

201
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:43,692
And who would've thought the
exact same thing happened.

202
00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:45,254
- I guess you're not getting
through your wallet, man.

203
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:47,351
- But how, I have a credit
card that lets me spend

204
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:48,275
as much money as I want.

205
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,108
I need it.
- What?

206
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:55,698
- It's still locked. I
still can't pay you guys.

207
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:56,531
Give it to-

208
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:59,698
- Oh.

209
00:07:01,763 --> 00:07:04,082
- Oh, that's empty.

210
00:07:04,082 --> 00:07:05,482
- Where is the money you are promising?

211
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:06,497
That's my wallet.

212
00:07:06,497 --> 00:07:09,174
So, guys now here. Look, gather around.

213
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:11,129
- Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

214
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,414
- Chad, get him, get him, get him.

215
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:17,414
♪ Mr.beast six thousand, oh ♪

216
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:21,202
♪ Mr.beast six thousand,
yeah, you know his name ♪

217
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:24,020
♪ He changed it once or twice,
but I think it's here to stay ♪

218
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:27,899
- If you ever wanna melt something

219
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,115
and you need to get it really
hot or you wanna do casting,

220
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:31,944
like our logo right here,
we put up on our wall,

221
00:07:31,944 --> 00:07:33,210
go to PMCsupplies.

222
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,181
They helped us out. They
got a ton of cool stuff.

223
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:37,081
And without them, this video
wouldn't have been possible.
