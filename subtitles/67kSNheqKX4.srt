103
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,210
bunking off like missing something

104
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,580
listening to music in your car

105
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,310
late night that's such a random guess

106
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,020
but if it's right then

107
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,630

127
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,009
Americans call swirlies where when

128
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,509
you're in school and someone flushes you

129
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,069
down the toilet all right like I wash my

130
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:11,490
hair

131
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,870

133
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:16,110
myself I'm gonna give myself a head bath

134
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,460
I think it's a cleanse

135
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,069
head back there's like the baptism it

136
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,810
cleanses your sins away so I think it's

137
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,969
a clam is it just like slang for getting

138
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:26,280
a like a head massage like it's so

139
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,930
relaxing that it's like beating your

140
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,199
head the meaning of head butt is washing

141
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,620
hair oh well that's what I said but I

142
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,259
thought it was too simple taking things

143
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,509
literally is probably the way to go so

144
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:41,789
all my invisible assistants here have

145
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:43,710
calculated the scores and we have a

146
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,930
winner and the winner of this challenge

147
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,750
is me all of you guys did really badly

148
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,479
I'm sorry I'm gonna take the award by

149
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,610
myself but did I lose them

150
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,099
because I think I changed things around

151
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,669
so you can never really lose if you're

152
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,099
an innovator I did not do well a bit

153
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,259
