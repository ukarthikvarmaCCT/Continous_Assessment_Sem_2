00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,929
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,929 --> 00:00:03,758
All of us have an aim in life.

3
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:06,121
If you're a college student,

4
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:08,374
you have assignments you need to complete.

5
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:10,290
If your exams are approaching,

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,876
you will promise yourself that you'll do your best to prepare for the exams,

7
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:15,542
so that you can top the exam.

8
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:17,674
If you are looking for a job,

9
00:00:17,674 --> 00:00:20,096
you want to prepare for the job.

10
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:24,121
*Why don't you do it?*

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,743
*We're waiting for you to do it.*

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,000
It takes no time for us to decide

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,683
what we want to achieve,

14
00:00:31,683 --> 00:00:33,822
but then we don't really do what we ought to.

15
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:36,555
There's an inherent feeling that tells you

16
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:38,544
that you can do it tomorrow. 

17
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:42,049
and that it's okay if you relax for a while on Instagram, 

18
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:44,960
scroll through the web, or watch comedy videos on YouTube.

19
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:48,812
While we put off things for tomorrow, we end up wasting time today.

20
00:00:48,812 --> 00:00:49,860
And tomorrow never arrives.

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,885
There's an English word for it.

22
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:56,731
Why do humans procrastinate?

23
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:59,951
In today's video, let's try to understand it from a scientific perspective

24
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:03,400
the psychology behind procrastination

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,891
and find the real solution to it.

26
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:08,670
"Today, we'll talk about laziness."

27
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,403
"I've always been lazy, my parents are trying to change me, but they're also lazy."

28
00:01:12,403 --> 00:01:16,321
"Such people have to strong desire to rest."

29
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,437
"Nothing will happen in the end."

30
00:01:17,437 --> 00:01:19,478
"You will fail in your comfort zone."

31
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:21,142
"Tomorrow I'll be doing what I was supposed to do 2 days ago."

32
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:24,004
"What goes on in the heads of procrastinators,
why we are the way we are?"

33
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:26,388
"Rich people don't sleep 8 hours a day."

34
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:29,591
"They leave everything up to God,
they simply eat and sleep."

35
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,191
Friends, in this video, I won't be giving you a motivational lecture,

36
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:39,313
because I believe that motivation is a short-lived phenomenon.

37
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,587
If you feel motivated after watching a video,

38
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:44,609
and start working powered with that motivation

39
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:46,901
you will work well for the next few hours,

40
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:49,978
at most, you will be motivated for the next 2-3 days,

41
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:52,717
but then the motivation would come crashing down,

42
00:01:52,717 --> 00:01:54,060
and you stop working.

43
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,403
Here, we'd use science to go to the root cause of procrastination.

44
00:01:58,403 --> 00:02:01,742
Dr Piers Steel is one of the leading researchers in the world,

45
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:03,906
on the science of motivation and procrastination.

46
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:07,386
He has been studying this science for over 10 years.

47
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:10,162
He believes that procrastination isn't a problem which

48
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:12,351
is seen exclusively in this era.

49
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:13,922
It has existed for ages.

50
00:02:13,922 --> 00:02:17,019
Thousands of years ago, in 1400 BC,

51
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:19,742
Egyptian hieroglyphs have been found,

52
00:02:19,742 --> 00:02:21,314
that talk about it.

53
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:25,310
A University of Toronto Egyptologist translated this

54
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,584
"Friend, stop putting off work

55
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:29,840
and allow us to go home in good time."

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,715
About 600 years after this, in 800 BC,

57
00:02:33,715 --> 00:02:36,531
an ancient Greek poet had said something similar.

58
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,153
In India, centuries ago, Sant Kabir had famously said,

59
00:02:48,153 --> 00:02:49,543
you'd recall this.

60
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:50,705
"Work today instead of putting it off for tomorrow,

61
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:51,862
Work now, instead of putting it off for later,

62
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:53,093
If a catastrophe strikes now,

63
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:54,556
when will you prepare for it."

64
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:57,259
He clearly tells you not to put off work for tomorrow,

65
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:59,015
not even for later in the day,

66
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:01,148
or else, if everything will end in a moment,

67
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,174
you won't be able to finish what you had set out to do.

68
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:06,956
This has been reiterated by many poets and motivational speakers in history.

69
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:09,398
But we have gotten worse.

70
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:10,973
According to Dr Steel,

71
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,280
in the last 40 years,

72
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,070
there has been a 300% to 400% growth in chronic procrastination.

73
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,558
Today, half the population in the world,

74
00:03:18,558 --> 00:03:19,886
procrastinates.

75
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:22,034
They procrastinate frequently.

76
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,509
But why do we do so?

77
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,572
We need to dig deeper.

78
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,857
Think about the things you procrastinate doing.

79
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:31,303
When you have to prepare for an exam

80
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:33,207
or for a job interview,

81
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:34,553
you procrastinate.

82
00:03:34,553 --> 00:03:38,555
But have you ever procrastinated while scrolling on Instagram?

83
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:40,757
Or while watching a comedy video on YouTube?

84
00:03:40,757 --> 00:03:41,764
Nope.

85
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:44,053
We procrastinate if it is an office project.

86
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:45,532
Or for exercising.

87
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:49,432
Or if it is something emotional, we'll procrastinate.

88
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:51,740
"When I need to say something important 

89
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,609
when I have to keep a promise,

90
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,900
when I have to reach out to someone,

91
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,720
when I have to reconnect with someone,

92
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,382
I am always late."

93
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:04,263
Basically, we procrastinate when it is something important.

94
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:07,360
Something that requires a lot of effort.

95
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,746
Physical, mental, or emotional effort.

96
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:13,115
We replace that task with something

97
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:16,577
that is easier and more interesting for us.

98
00:04:16,577 --> 00:04:18,367
Such as browsing on social media.

99
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:19,719
Or watching a film.

100
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:22,486
Here, deadlines play an important role.

101
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:24,916
If there is a deadline for our task,

102
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,790
wherein we need to finish it before the deadline,

103
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,805
we procrastinate until we reach the deadline.

104
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:33,744
Suppose we have to make a presentation and submit it tomorrow,

105
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:39,356
even this morning, you'll feel like procrastinating and scrolling through Instagram.

106
00:04:39,356 --> 00:04:41,733
Only for 5 minutes before you begin the project.

107
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,653
And we're very familiar with how

108
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:46,224
the 5 minutes turn into 1 hour without us finding out.

109
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:49,638
I have talked about this in detail in the video on Social Media.

110
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:51,540
These websites have been designed in a way that

111
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,092
even if you spend a little time on them,

112
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:55,886
it sucks you in,

113
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:57,972
and this little time turns into a long time.

114
00:04:57,972 --> 00:05:01,057
But even if you start working 1 hour later,

115
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:04,258
you'll be hungry and start raiding your fridge,

116
00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:06,560
so that you can get the energy to study.

117
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,116
But after eating, you would want to set the mood to be productive.

118
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:14,281
To do so, you will start watching comedy videos on YouTube.

119
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,286
Another hour wasted in it,

120
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:18,877
and you start feeling tired,

121
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:23,032
so you think that it's better to take a shower, get freshen up before starting work.

122
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:26,288
Hours pass by and day turns into night,

123
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,369
and then an alarm goes off in your mind,

124
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,390
you are left with 12 hours only,
you need to finish it somehow.

125
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,342
When it is time to sleep,

126
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:35,734
you start making the presentation,

127
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:39,402
you stay awake the whole night and work on it till the last minute.

128
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:41,540
Several studies have been conducted on college students

129
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,178
Such as the study by Ellis and Knaus in 1977

130
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,411
or by O'Brien in 2002.

131
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:51,995
According to these, approximately 80% to 90% of college students

132
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:53,774
procrastinate.

133
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:56,409
But in college at least, we're given a deadline

134
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:59,470
so that somehow or the other we complete our work by the end moment,

135
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,627
but what happens when there are no deadlines?

136
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:06,236
Friends, in such cases, the procrastination may continue infinitely.

137
00:06:06,236 --> 00:06:08,404
There is no end to procrastination.

138
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:10,373
Wasting time in college meant that

139
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:12,231
you don't get good marks,

140
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:14,557
or you may not get a good job,

141
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:15,849
these aren't crucial.

142
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:18,804
But procrastinating later in life would mean

143
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:21,392
that your life may be full of regrets.

144
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:25,380
If you had a dream of trying your hand at filmmaking,

145
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,522
to quit your job and become a filmmaker,

146
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:30,982
but you never actually try to make it happen.

147
00:06:30,982 --> 00:06:33,608
You would have heard elders say something like

148
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:37,862
they wanted to become great at something when they were younger,

149
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:40,634
and that they couldn't do it because of circumstances.

150
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,666
They say that they used to have big dreams.

151
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,554
Often, they blame the circumstances.

152
00:06:45,554 --> 00:06:49,161
But they know that they didn't try.

153
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:52,026
They are now stuck with a permanent 'What If' feeling.

154
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:54,872
To procrastinate on fitness and exercising means

155
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,006
you will eventually gain weight

156
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:58,456
nothing major,

157
00:06:58,456 --> 00:07:02,086
if you start eating healthy and start exercising,

158
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:05,084
within a few months or years, you can lose weight once again.

159
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:08,567
But if you continue procrastinating for years,

160
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:10,334
one day it will come as a shock

161
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:11,914
that you have diabetes,

162
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:16,457
or you'd be told that you need to put in a stunt in your heart.

163
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:18,455
Some people don't even get this chance.

164
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:22,068
They get sudden heart strokes and lose their lives.

165
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:26,506
Apart from this, the consequences of procrastinating on emotional stuff are severe.

166
00:07:26,506 --> 00:07:30,431
You might dream of taking your grandparents

167
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:34,529
on an aeroplane one day,

168
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:36,010
but that day may not come.

169
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,109
If you keep procrastinating about this,

170
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:41,606
one day you will find out that they passed away.

171
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:44,493
As a result, you'll be left with heavy regret.

172
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,286
Disappointment over these.

173
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:48,897
It is not only about lifetime regret,

174
00:07:48,897 --> 00:07:51,061
it brings in stress, anxiety, and depression as well.

175
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:54,100
The thing you want to do,
and the thing you are doing,

176
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,784
if there's a huge gap between the two,

177
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:57,891
there will be a mental conflict within you,

178
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:00,303
this can be termed Cognitive Dissonance.

179
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:04,316
In a study conducted in a German university on more than 1,000 people,

180
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:06,423
it was found that due to procrastination,

181
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:10,988
there are high levels of stress, depression, anxiety, fatigue,

182
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:12,939
it impacts everything.

183
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:18,051
Another feeling that accompanies procrastination is guilt.

184
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:22,230
If we aren't happy with procrastination,

185
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,880
why do we do it?

186
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,442
Scientists have come up with 4 theories for it.

187
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:28,473
The first is the Expectancy Theory.

188
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:31,770
Given by Victor Harold Vroom in 1964,

189
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,491
according to this theory, the motivation of a person to do a task

190
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:41,787
depends upon the expectation of the person with the result.

191
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:45,927
The chances of achieving the result of the task are low,

192
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:48,720
the motivation to do the task will also be low.

193
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,894
For example,

194
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:52,371
suppose your school or college tells you

195
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:55,842
that the person who'll get the first rank in the class

196
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:57,737
will get a reward of ₹1 million,

197
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,980
will you get motivated to study hard?

198
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,031
Will you work to get the 1st rank?

199
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:08,332
If you are someone that scores high in your class,

200
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:11,507
and you know that you are always in the top 10,

201
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:15,493
you know that you have a high chance to win this prize money.

202
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:18,049
If so, you will study as diligently as you can,

203
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:20,589
and will start working immediately to get the 1st rank.

204
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:22,228
But if you are someone,

205
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,782
that lags behind in class,

206
00:09:23,782 --> 00:09:26,170
you don't get good marks,

207
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,893
and rank in the bottom,

208
00:09:27,893 --> 00:09:31,754
and you know there are more diligent and intelligent students in class,

209
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:34,798
then you know that you have a low chance of winning the prize money.

210
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:37,914
And so your motivation to study will be low as well.

211
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:40,067
There is a direct relation

212
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:43,239
of the level of your motivation to the expectancy of the result.

213
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,849
Remember this.

214
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:46,539
Now let's talk about the second theory.

215
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:48,398
The second theory is the need theory.

216
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:53,511
Coined in the 1960s, by famous psychologist David McClelland.

217
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:58,845
He says that there are 3 types of needs of people.

218
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,174
Affiliations mean the need for social relationships.

219
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,903
Depending upon your personality

220
00:10:09,903 --> 00:10:14,208
your most vital need depends on you.

221
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:18,379
If you are given a task that matches your psychological needs,

222
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:21,348
you will be more motivated to do it.

223
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:23,076
Let's take another example.

224
00:10:23,076 --> 00:10:30,425
What do you think our politicians need the most?

225
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:31,826
Power.

226
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:33,694
Every one of them wants to rule,

227
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:35,972
this shows their strong desire for power.

228
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:39,432
If they are given a task related to that need,

229
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:41,197
they will rush to complete the task.

230
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:43,345
Their motivation will be through the roof.

231
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:45,435
But on the other hand, if they are tasked

232
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:47,461
with working for the people,

233
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:49,876
since they do not have a strong need for that,

234
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:52,133
they will procrastinate on that task.

235
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:55,058
Similarly, you have to figure out your dominant need.

236
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:57,794
Your psychological needs.

237
00:10:57,794 --> 00:10:59,913
If you have a strong need for power,

238
00:10:59,913 --> 00:11:02,078
you will want to succeed at your job,

239
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,098
in such cases, if you are given a task to get a job promotion,

240
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,966
you will have the highest level of motivation to do that task.

241
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:13,260
Understand your needs and look at your tasks from that perspective.

242
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,607
Another example is if you have a strong need for affiliation,

243
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:20,748
it means that you respect building connections with people,

244
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:23,063
for maintaining relationships with people,

245
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:26,859
their respect and their approval,
are of higher priority,

246
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:31,164
then you'll excel at the tasks related to team work.

247
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:35,077
The third theory is the Cumulative Prospect Theory.

248
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:40,263
This was coined in 1992 by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.

249
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:42,719
This theory talks of mainly 2 things.

250
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,755
First is loss aversion.

251
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:48,681
It means that if at the same magnitude,
you will face a profit or a loss, 

252
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:50,205
it would be significant for you,

253
00:11:50,205 --> 00:11:53,414
and you derive motivation from it.

254
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:55,217
Loss of a particular magnitude,

255
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:56,517
weighs more heavily than

256
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:57,718
a gain of the same magnitude.

257
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,415
The example of exercising that I cited a while back,

258
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:02,836
If I tell you to exercise,

259
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:04,932
so that you are fit and build muscles,

260
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,355
the motivation you get from this will only be a little.

261
00:12:08,355 --> 00:12:11,089
But if I tell you to exercise,

262
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:15,004
because your test results reveal that you will soon become diabetic,

263
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:18,274
and if the doctor says that if you don't exercise,

264
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:20,273
you might suffer a heart attack within the next year,

265
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,778
and that by exercising you can prevent this from happening,

266
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:27,387
your motivation will be much higher than in the last example.

267
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:29,267
Similarly, in another example,

268
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:33,300
if I tell you to do something in order to secure a promotion,

269
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,663
or if I tell you to do something or else you'll be fired from your job,

270
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:40,967
in which case will you be motivated more?

271
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:42,970
Most people think that

272
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,399
it's okay whether they get something extra or not,

273
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,306
they shouldn't suffer any losses.

274
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:49,363
They don't want to lose what they have.

275
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:51,886
The second thing that this theory talks about,

276
00:12:51,886 --> 00:12:54,106
is that when we're talking about gains and losses,

277
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,942
it is all relative.

278
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,827
The reference point is different for different people.

279
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:00,945
If a person living in a slum

280
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:03,542
is working diligently to prepare for a job interview,

281
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:06,107
if he gets the job it will improve his life,

282
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:09,059
On the other hand, another person,
who is the child of a landlord,

283
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,872
living comfortably and not lacking money,

284
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:15,700
is preparing for the same job interview,

285
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,558
and if he gets the job, it wouldn't make much difference to his life,

286
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:23,677
think about it, of these two, who will feel more motivated?

287
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,103
Now let's see the fourth and the last theory.

288
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:28,723
Hyperbolic Discounting Theory.

289
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:32,289
It basically means that the reward that we can get immediately,

290
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,473
we'll want to work for those rewards,

291
00:13:34,473 --> 00:13:38,320
as compared to the rewards that we can get after some time.

292
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,121
There's a Hindi proverb about it too.

293
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,278
₹9 in cash is better than ₹13 as a contingency. 

294
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:44,467
Who can guarantee the future?

295
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:48,228
You need to hold on to the things that you have now.

296
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,415
In contrast to this, you will have heard statements like,

297
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:52,994
'Don't Be Shortsighted.'

298
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:54,368
'Look at the larger picture.'

299
00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:55,644
'Have a vision.'

300
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:56,708
'Think of the future.'

301
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,581
Thinking about the long term is good,

302
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:02,626
but we are more motivated

303
00:14:02,626 --> 00:14:05,801
when we work on something that guarantees instant gratification.

304
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,451
Friends, these four theories,

305
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:11,092
have been combined in 2006

306
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:13,073
to form a meta-theory.

307
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:16,571
By Dr Piers Steel and Dr Cornelius J. König.

308
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:20,710
This combined theory was named the Temporal Motivation Theory.

309
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,340
According to this combined theory,

310
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,335
your motivation to do a task,

311
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:27,554
will not come from watching a motivational video,

312
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:29,823
you will get the motivation to work,

313
00:14:29,823 --> 00:14:32,100
when your personal need,

314
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,297
matches the work and the reward of the work.

315
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:38,780
When you expect that you can actually do the task,

316
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,450
and win the reward.

317
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,858
When the reward you get after completing the task,

318
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:45,403
is higher than your reference line.

319
00:14:45,403 --> 00:14:47,324
When the reward means something to you.

320
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:50,381
And finally, you want the reward as soon as possible without much delay.

321
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:53,035
If all these factors are combined,

322
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:55,356
you will not procrastinate.

323
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:58,384
This can also be represented as a mathematical formula.

324
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,504
If you go a level further from procrastination and motivation,

325
00:15:10,504 --> 00:15:14,660
and want to eliminate the habit of wasting time in your life,

326
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,225
I have built a 2-hour long detailed practical course for it.

327
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:21,393
In it, I have shared tips on time management, productivity,

328
00:15:21,393 --> 00:15:24,950
and overall happiness in life,

329
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,147
which I apply in my life,

330
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:28,743
which enables me to do so much.

331
00:15:28,743 --> 00:15:30,264
Putting up a Shorts video every day,

332
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,127
Regular videos on the main channel,

333
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:33,645
the vlog channel, and travelling.

334
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:36,324
Last month when I told you about this course,

335
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:40,114
about 1,500 people among you have joined it,

336
00:15:40,114 --> 00:15:42,107
and I got such amazing reviews.

337
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,219
Many of you said that this course was life-changing for you.

338
00:15:45,219 --> 00:15:48,561
In this course, you will get day-to-day experiences, live sessions,

339
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:51,243
a community chat group, trainers to explain things,

340
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,996
and a Live Q&A Session with me.

341
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,026
Where you can directly ask me questions.

342
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:59,754
I'm happy to announce that the next class will begin on 13th August.

343
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:02,326
So those of you who haven't joined the course yet,

344
00:16:02,326 --> 00:16:03,741
you can do it now,

345
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:05,656
the link to it is the description below.

346
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:07,696
Not only will there be one-sided lectures

347
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:09,193
but you will also be given regular homework,

348
00:16:09,193 --> 00:16:11,583
so that you can apply these techniques to your life.

349
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,944
the first 1,000 people of you to join,

350
00:16:13,944 --> 00:16:15,271
will get a discount of ₹1,000

351
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:17,094
so don't procrastinate on it

352
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:18,449
and let's get back to the topic.

353
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:22,076
Some scientists have criticised this theory

354
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:24,869
saying that this theory doesn't cover everything.

355
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:27,879
Psychologists Tim Pychyl and J. R. Ferrari, 

356
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:29,692
have been against this theory.

357
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:33,291
They claim that if everything related to motivation is so rational,

358
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:37,786
if we use this formula to calculate the motivation to watch a YouTube video,

359
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:40,240
and the motivation to study,

360
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,167
obviously, the motivation to watch YouTube videos would be higher.

361
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,570
So why do people experience guilt over it?

362
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,457
Why do people feel bad when they are doing something

363
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:50,630
that they are more motivated to do?

364
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,512
These two psychologists argued that

365
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,340
in addition to these factors,

366
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,405
there is another factor contributing to procrastination.

367
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:59,871
The factor of Fear of Failure.

368
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:01,501
We are scared of failing.

369
00:17:01,501 --> 00:17:03,445
That's why we procrastinate.

370
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:05,867
They claimed this in 2012.

371
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:08,232
If we set aside the other factors,

372
00:17:08,232 --> 00:17:11,767
some people are still not motivated to work,

373
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:16,011
because they are scared that they'd fail in the task,

374
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:18,948
so they put aside the task and start doing something else.

375
00:17:18,948 --> 00:17:21,045
So what's the conclusion of all of this?

376
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:23,837
What is the solution to procrastination?

377
00:17:23,837 --> 00:17:25,613
How do we stop procrastination?

378
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:27,973
The solution to it can be found in these theories.

379
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:31,521
The new theories that are seen as a counter

380
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:33,462
are not against the previous theories.

381
00:17:33,462 --> 00:17:36,816
The actual reason behind procrastination can be any of these.

382
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:38,771
Sometimes it is low expectations,

383
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:41,108
or the needs not matching,

384
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:43,425
or even the fear of failure.

385
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:46,862
Friends, the thing is that once you understand these causes,

386
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:51,521
and you use it to identify the reason you procrastinate,

387
00:17:51,521 --> 00:17:54,682
the reason why you put off working on things you shouldn't.

388
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:57,987
Then you can curate a solution for yourself.

389
00:17:57,987 --> 00:18:02,013
First of all, empty your thoughts, and take a pen and paper.

390
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:03,630
And ask yourself.

391
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,329
Why are you procrastinating?

392
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,879
Only when you write down the cause,

393
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:12,042
you will be able to find the solution to it,

394
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,915
identifying the problem,

395
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:15,876
is half the solution.

396
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:18,012
If you are procrastinating at work,

397
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:22,474
thinking that your task is insignificant,

398
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:24,129
and your lack of motivation,

399
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:25,799
then recall loss aversion.

400
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:29,810
Remind yourself that not doing the task may lead to you being fired.

401
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,814
And then think about the consequences of being jobless.

402
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:36,378
If you lack motivation because

403
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:40,919
even after studying hard, you know that you cannot get to the top ranks,

404
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,031
then go do something where you are confident

405
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:46,824
that you can perform well in that field of study

406
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:49,117
or something that you like a lot

407
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:51,542
and where you can get good results.

408
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,949
If you are preparing for a major exam,

409
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:56,178
and the reward seems very far-fetched.

410
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,369
Or if you'll get the reward only after 2 years,

411
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:02,826
then you need to divide the process into smaller steps.

412
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:05,961
After each step, give yourself a small reward.

413
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:08,930
So that you can get some instant gratification.

414
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,973
If you are scared about taking an important decision,

415
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:14,570
if you are afraid of failing,

416
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,583
remember that not trying is worse than failing.

417
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,459
We are scared of failure,

418
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:22,885
because we have so much ego.

419
00:19:22,885 --> 00:19:26,196
We are scared that if we fail,
what would the others say?

420
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:28,271
If I wanted to be a filmmaker,

421
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:31,426
and went to Mumbai but couldn't become one,

422
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:32,857
what would my friends say?

423
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:35,500
"You went to Mumbai to be a filmmaker

424
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,665
but you couldn't be one.

425
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:39,377
I had warned you against leaving your job,

426
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:40,897
but you didn't listen to me."

427
00:19:40,897 --> 00:19:43,340
Many people are scared of such statements.

428
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,251
For this, we need to understand that

429
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,860
our ego is the most useless thing in life.

430
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,265
If we are absorbed with what others say about us,

431
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:54,419
if we keep building our life based on the expectations of other people,

432
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,493
we will regret it later.

433
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:58,666
I had talked about regrets earlier in this video,

434
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:02,638
about the regrets, people have to deal with later in their lives.

435
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:05,722
Remember, you too might have to face those.

436
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:08,265
In 1995, Gilovich and Medvec,

437
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:10,368
came up with the Temporal Theory of Regret.

438
00:20:10,368 --> 00:20:11,995
According to this theory,

439
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:15,215
actions may produce greater regret in the short term,

440
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,006
but inaction will generate more regret in the long run.

441
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:20,079
If you do something now,

442
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:25,010
you may end up doing something that you will regret in the short term,

443
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,474
but not doing something will give you more regret in the long term.

444
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:31,347
If you quit your job and follow your dream,

445
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:32,359
and then fail,

446
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,299
you will regret it less than

447
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,769
if you had never left your job,

448
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,578
the last obstacle between procrastination and you,

449
00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:44,442
are the distractions.

450
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:46,284
Social media, your phone,

451
00:20:46,284 --> 00:20:48,627
this is the last thing I am talking about,

452
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:52,721
because if the other reasons and obstacles to motivation I told you about

453
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:54,484
is clear to you,

454
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:57,914
you will hardly if ever, be distracted by the distractions.

455
00:20:57,914 --> 00:21:01,338
But if you are still distracted by things like social media,

456
00:21:01,338 --> 00:21:03,223
you should watch this video.

457
00:21:03,223 --> 00:21:07,427
In this, I have talked about how you can deal with social media addiction scientifically.

458
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:09,066
Thank you very much!
