1
00:00:01,265 --> 00:00:02,365
Friends, this is the

2
00:00:02,365 --> 00:00:04,387
First Class in Emirates.

3
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:19,705
Friends, our tickets have been
upgraded to the First Class.

4
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:21,021
The lounges are up ahead,

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,542
and there's even a gym here.

6
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:23,897
A gym in the airport!

7
00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:24,981
This one?

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,169
I thought it was that one.

9
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:27,981
Fast Lane.

10
00:00:29,558 --> 00:00:31,267
Is this your fast lane pass?

11
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:33,091
Fast Lane pass ready!

12
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:41,214
Our gate is at C

13
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:44,507
they told us it'd take half an hour
to reach there by walking.

14
00:00:44,507 --> 00:00:46,553
This airport is so huge that

15
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:48,312
you can walk for half an hour in it

16
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:49,814
all within the same building.

17
00:00:49,814 --> 00:00:51,916
This is the poster of Spirit of Dubai.

18
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,107
But this woman in the painting

19
00:00:54,107 --> 00:00:55,942
seems to be carrying the Indian flag.

20
00:00:55,942 --> 00:00:57,655
Quite an international painting.

21
00:00:57,655 --> 00:00:58,757
People of all kinds.

22
00:00:58,757 --> 00:01:01,957
And even some Mongolian army.

23
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:04,285
And we're at their First Class Lounge.

24
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:05,940
And the Business Class Lounge
is on the other side.

25
00:01:07,737 --> 00:01:11,100
So actually, we were rejected from
the First Class Lounge,

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,608
because they said that the upgrades,

27
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:16,581
do not include access to the Lounge.

28
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,692
Even though our seats got upgraded,

29
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:20,657
the upgrade doesn't allow us to go to the Lounge. 

30
00:01:21,097 --> 00:01:23,528
So we're not fully in First Class.

31
00:01:23,803 --> 00:01:25,516
We're actually half a class.

32
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:26,953
*Such an insult.*

33
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:30,632
There's a golden palm tree at the airport.

34
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,080
Look at those gold bars.

35
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:43,375
No, you're doing it to the Business Class,

36
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,879
you need to do it to the...

37
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:49,902
This is a Boeing 777 plane,

38
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,347
Airbus A380 is better than this.

39
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:53,890
Because that has 2 floors.

40
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:55,749
This is the same.

41
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:58,213
I'd say that this is the second best.

42
00:01:58,213 --> 00:01:59,376
What's our seat?

43
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:07,245
Wow, there's so much space!

44
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:09,602
I don't see any place to
store the bags above us.

45
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,157
Wow.

46
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,808
They've even provided us slippers.

47
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:20,722
It literally feels like a room, you know?

48
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:22,917
Like you booked a hotel room or something.

49
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:25,552
They've kept flowers there.

50
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:26,578
Oh, yeah?

51
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:28,945
Once you close this, and that one,

52
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,210
we'll kind of have our own little cave.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,123
There are so many mirrors here.

54
00:02:50,123 --> 00:02:53,354
The one that you can see here,
is the TV.

55
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:54,967
The real mirror is here,

56
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,450
in case you need to put on make-up.

57
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,910
There's a mirror at the side,
behind the lamp.

58
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,676
There's a mirror at the bar,

59
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:03,573
so that you can check out the drinks stored here.

60
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:06,696
There's a mirror at the back too.

61
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,068
The seat is less of a seat

62
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:11,014
and more of a mirror maze.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,899
And we've taken off.

64
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:20,755
Most of the seats in the
First Class are empty.

65
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:22,451
If I zoom in a lot,

66
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,434
I can see the Burj Khalifa.

67
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:25,761
See, there it is.

68
00:03:25,761 --> 00:03:28,382
Let me reduce the brightness a bit.

69
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:30,374
They have an accurate map here.

70
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:33,830
Look at how fast the plane is flying.

71
00:03:34,142 --> 00:03:36,000
The seat belt sign has been turned off,

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,927
let me take out the tripod

73
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:42,453
so that I can show you everything properly.

74
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:43,956
By pushing this button,

75
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:45,595
this door closes.

76
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:47,544
Now that the doors have closed,

77
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:51,046
this has turned into a room of sorts.

78
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:52,613
No one can peek in from the outside,

79
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:54,377
because the doors are quite tall.

80
00:03:54,377 --> 00:03:57,999
And there's a barrier between me and Juli as well.

81
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,095
This one.

82
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:03,208
By raising this one,
this will become a proper room.

83
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:10,621
See you.

84
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:12,633
Do you see how high these are?

85
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:14,039
From both sides.

86
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,000
The only thing missing is a roof on top.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,769
But there's no roof,

88
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,553
It's just empty space above us.

89
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:22,577
Above this height,

90
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:24,315
and above this height here.

91
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:25,875
So if I stand up,

92
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,413
I can easily peek in.

93
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:31,733
Even so, as I told you,
there's a lot of privacy.

94
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,748
Let me open this one,

95
00:04:33,748 --> 00:04:35,998
Because there's some nice light here.

96
00:04:35,998 --> 00:04:37,159
Pull Here To Open.

97
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,184
Since this isn't allowing me to pull,

98
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:39,627
we'll have to push the button.

99
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,770
And now let's take a look at the menu.

100
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,576
The menu here is so good.

101
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,562
There're so many dishes for you.

102
00:04:45,562 --> 00:04:47,510
And such posh dishes.

103
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,029
Like, see this one.

104
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:51,355
Honey Roasted Pumpkin with Thyme.

105
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:54,000
Pan Fried King Oyster Mushroom.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,491
I will order this dish.

107
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:57,519
And don't be misled with the word 'Oyster',

108
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,538
this is a vegan dish.

109
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:01,796
Oyster Mushroom is a type of mushroom.

110
00:05:01,796 --> 00:05:03,221
Not oyster.

111
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,561
Award-winning triple cream blue cheese from Germany.

112
00:05:07,561 --> 00:05:08,897
Well, that is fancy.

113
00:05:08,897 --> 00:05:11,014
Premium aged Dutch gouda.

114
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:13,375
Handmade red...

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,364
How do you pronounce that?

116
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:23,033
Juli has already made her bed here.

117
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:26,766
Actually, they've even provided mattresses here.

118
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:29,651
So you can take out the mattress,

119
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:32,800
before you lie down,

120
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,500
and there are pillows obviously.

121
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,975
And a blanket as well.

122
00:05:36,342 --> 00:05:38,798
You can see how spacious this is
when you look from above.

123
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:42,047
Look how much space I have to spread out. 

124
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:44,720
My feet are still not reaching the end.

125
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,030
There's so much extra space in here.

126
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,090
So do you wanna work on something?

127
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,618
Or write down any ideas?

128
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,541
Just press that thing there.

129
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,775
What thing?

130
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,230
This board.

131
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,466
-This?
-Yeah.

132
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:58,628
-This one?
-Yeah.

133
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh.

134
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,613
Wow.

135
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:08,427
They gave you a whole notebook.

136
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:10,145
With an Emirates plane.

137
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:14,519
-I'm gonna work.
-Work on the next video ideas?

138
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:17,470
We've closed both doors here.

139
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,768
Juli is going to sleep,

140
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:20,886
and no one will come to disturb us,

141
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:23,240
so I think this is the best time

142
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,246
do the most exciting thing.

143
00:06:26,246 --> 00:06:27,590
What's the most exciting thing?

144
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,988
The various buttons that we have here,

145
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:32,042
and the different secret compartments,

146
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:33,369
let's explore those.

147
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:35,903
First of all, here.

148
00:06:35,903 --> 00:06:37,719
This opens and closes the door.

149
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,867
With this, the table tray comes out,

150
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,078
And this makes the bed.

151
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:44,923
So let's turn this seat into a bed.

152
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:53,556
Wow!

153
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:03,125
Look at the width of this bed.

154
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,530
I have big hands,

155
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,418
I span 15 cm approximately,

156
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:09,913
so I think the bed is 45cm-50cm wide.

157
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:12,131
The blanket is here,

158
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,147
there's the mattress,

159
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,412
Juli has already laid down her mattress.

160
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:18,266
Apart from this, there's a small iPad here,

161
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:20,630
this controls the TV screen.

162
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,126
And there's a compartment here.

163
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:24,863
You can store your phone here.

164
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:27,189
Right above it, are these buttons,

165
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:29,822
that moves this barrier.

166
00:07:29,822 --> 00:07:31,106
What is this thing?

167
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:33,040
This looks like a fan of sorts.

168
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:34,701
I don't know which button turns this on.

169
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,126
And with the buttons here,

170
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:38,740
these lights can be turned on and off.

171
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,580
This button controls the brightness of the lights.

172
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:45,193
You can control the brightness as well.

173
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,827
There are so many settings here.

174
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:48,712
Press.

175
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:52,196
What happened?
What did this open?

176
00:07:52,196 --> 00:07:54,078
Oh, I got it, this basically

177
00:07:54,078 --> 00:07:56,260
is pressed to bring out this iPad,

178
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,992
and this button locks it.

179
00:07:57,992 --> 00:07:59,314
There are two more buttons.

180
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:00,939
Let's press them and see what happens.

181
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,122
Oh wow, it's ascending in style.

182
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:09,485
This drinks area moves up a bit by pressing this.

183
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:11,628
And pressing it again, send it back.

184
00:08:11,628 --> 00:08:12,141
Oh.

185
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,988
What's this thing?

186
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:17,658
Wow.

187
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,373
So big.

188
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:21,202
This is so huge.

189
00:08:53,476 --> 00:08:55,240
That was some quality sleep here.

190
00:08:56,432 --> 00:08:58,231
Since this bed is so spacious,

191
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:00,843
Sleeping normally, on your back,

192
00:09:00,843 --> 00:09:03,329
though it is possible in business class,

193
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:05,154
but you can't move from one side to the other.

194
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:07,140
You have to sleep straight on your back.

195
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,689
But there's so much space here,

196
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:10,382
you can sleep on your sides,

197
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:12,175
and even fold your legs and sleep.

198
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:13,206
You can do it all.

199
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:14,655
It is so spacious.

200
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:18,355
And the mattress that they've provided,

201
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:19,991
this is so comfortable.

202
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:21,680
Food's about to come.

203
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,060
Let's see how the food will be.

204
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,434
I'm watching the movie

205
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:25,741
Bunty and Babli 2.

206
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:27,004
I haven't watched it before.

207
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:29,152
Even the screen's so big.

208
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,390
This is their Mango Avacado Salad.

209
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,469
And this is the first course.

210
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,240
Friends, the main course has arrived.

211
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,969
This main dish looks like a meat dish,

212
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,919
but these are oyster mushrooms.

213
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:07,191
A seasonal salad with it,

214
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,036
and the pumpkin side dish.

215
00:10:09,036 --> 00:10:13,208
And a delicious feast is ready here.

216
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:21,366
Friends, can you see this?

217
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,055
This is unbelievably good.

218
00:10:26,402 --> 00:10:28,256
After experiencing luxury at this level,

219
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:29,914
the only point of concern is that

220
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:33,646
whenever we travel next,

221
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:36,629
how will any experience match up to this?

222
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:38,495
We'll be disappointed.

223
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:42,000
So after I made the video on cold drinks,

224
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,340
you might wonder what I drink
since I don't drink cold drinks, 

225
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,745
other than drinking water.

226
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:49,263
I've ordered a virgin mojito here. 

227
00:10:49,263 --> 00:10:51,959
A virgin mojito contains water and lime juice,

228
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,206
and sugar.

229
00:10:53,206 --> 00:10:55,141
If you reduce the amount of sugar in it,

230
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:58,000
to relatively, there's nothing harmful in it.

231
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:01,257
Like this one has little to no sugar.

232
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:03,000
Very little sugar.

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,815
If you want to drink this,

234
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:06,209
keep in mind that normally,

235
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:08,027
virgin mojito contains a lot of sugar,

236
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:10,454
but if you drink it with only a little sugar,

237
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:14,767
Normally they make it with soft drink.

238
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:17,536
Pour some soft drink,
then lime juice, and mint.

239
00:11:17,536 --> 00:11:20,195
This one hardly has any, if any,

240
00:11:20,195 --> 00:11:21,801
sugar or soft drink,

241
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:24,284
so it's more like sparkling water,

242
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,073
with lime juice and mint.

243
00:11:26,073 --> 00:11:28,020
And it's extremely refreshing.

244
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:31,193
Even the bread basket was special here.

245
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:34,052
When I took out a bread from here,
it turned out to be garlic bread.

246
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:36,572
See the garlic stuffing in it.

247
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,581
Another big difference,

248
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,779
are the headphones you get.

249
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:44,575
Look at these, they look so high quality.

250
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:50,850
And everyone gets a snack basket.

251
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,276
And it has everything.

252
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:55,823
It has some nuts, some trail mix,

253
00:11:55,823 --> 00:11:57,461
gummy bears.

254
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:59,824
Chocolate, of which I already ate a piece.

255
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:02,399
And some vegetable chips.

256
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,840
Let's see what's going on here.

257
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:06,817
Oh, they booked the VIP package.

258
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:07,901
What is that?

259
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,459
Let's stick to work.

260
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:12,584
There's a hilarious scene in the movie.

261
00:12:12,584 --> 00:12:15,550
When the Bunty-Babli song plays.

262
00:12:15,898 --> 00:12:18,304
So they say Masha'Allah in the song,

263
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:22,447
and the subtitles write it as Hallelujah.

264
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:23,954
Wait, you'll see now.

265
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:34,093
It's interesting to read the subtitles.

266
00:12:34,093 --> 00:12:36,072
To see how things have been translated,

267
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:38,669
sometimes the translations are really weird.

268
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:41,420
There are some things that I've still not understood,

269
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,975
What are they actually?

270
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:44,681
There are always some undecipherable things.

271
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,459
Like this one over here.

272
00:12:46,826 --> 00:12:48,677
It seems like a speaker.

273
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,594
But what's the purpose of having a speaker?

274
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:53,607
For announcements?

275
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:54,902
Yeah.

276
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,990
If you look at the quality of the things

277
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,953
in comparison to the normal seats
or business class seats,

278
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:03,188
they're of high quality.

279
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:04,684
They're a fabric layer here,

280
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,057
this isn't just plastic.

281
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:07,586
It's real gold.

282
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,925
This is real gold?

283
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:10,903
I don't think so.

284
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,522
That would be too much.

285
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:15,429
Another interesting thing here,

286
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:16,903
this is a light,

287
00:13:16,903 --> 00:13:17,951
that's normal,

288
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,605
But this is the AC vent.

289
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:21,082
I've finally figured out how to turn it on.

290
00:13:21,082 --> 00:13:22,620
It turns on like this,

291
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,566
and blows so much air,

292
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:26,455
you can literally dry your hair.

293
00:13:27,152 --> 00:13:29,008
If you look at the bottom here,

294
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,883
there's a charger here,

295
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:33,868
you can close this.

296
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:36,219
Another USB charger here.

297
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:38,587
And a belt that you can pull out.

298
00:13:38,587 --> 00:13:41,052
I think the purpose of this belt is different.

299
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:44,086
Because there's another belt lower than the first.

300
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:47,569
And I think both belts can be attached there,

301
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:49,968
and keep the bags secure.

302
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:51,712
in case the bags are moving about.

303
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:53,697
Talking about the corner spaces,

304
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:55,830
there's a corner space here,

305
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,627
what have they put there?

306
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,753
This is a small compartment.

307
00:13:59,753 --> 00:14:01,592
I might just be an empty space.

308
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,926
And the magazines and headphones were placed here.

309
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:08,217
These two doors,
that's actually one door,

310
00:14:08,217 --> 00:14:10,526
the blinds point down.

311
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:13,092
We can look down from the inside,

312
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:16,409
but someone outside at eye level,
won't be able to look inside.

313
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:20,045
This is the first seat where you can
fold your legs and sit.

314
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:24,811
Whenever I watch a film,

315
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:26,666
I regret it because

316
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,600
On this flight of 5-6 hours,

317
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,918
I feel like watching a movie here is a waste of time.

318
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:33,448
That I'm missing out on a chance to enjoy.

319
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:36,689
Each minute spent on this seat,

320
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:39,086
should be fully enjoyed,

321
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,884
not wasted by watching a movie.

322
00:14:40,884 --> 00:14:42,766
That's what I'm feeling repeatedly.

323
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:48,003
This is another unique angle here.

324
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:51,932
I'm showing you the seat from all angles

325
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,720
so that you get the best idea.
