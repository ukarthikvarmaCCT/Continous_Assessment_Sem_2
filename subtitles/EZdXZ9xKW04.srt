1
00:00:00,293 --> 00:00:02,340
Is this Bhabhi's conspiracy?

2
00:00:02,365 --> 00:00:05,055
Does Bhabhi wants him to leave the channel?

3
00:00:05,416 --> 00:00:07,843
Was Bhabhi always plotting?

4
00:00:08,787 --> 00:00:10,300
Was this Bhabhi's plan?

5
00:00:10,746 --> 00:00:13,646
Was this her conscious plan?

6
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:27,643
Yesterday, Gaurav Taneja aka Flying
Beast was arrested, by the Noida Police.

7
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,577
He was arrested on the basis of these
two sections visible on your screen.

8
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:35,865
Will discuss whether this
arrest was right or wrong.

9
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:37,797
What this tells us,

10
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:43,433
we'll talk about it and decode
whether the arrest was fine or not.

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,840
But before that, let's understand
a few things. What is Vlogging?

12
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:50,319
Show our life by holding camera?

13
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:52,521
Why does one do vlogging?

14
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:54,758
If something interesting
is happening in your life,

15
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,621
then you give a chance to
the people in your life to peek.

16
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:03,154
You must have seen that we are more
interested in the life of others than our own.

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,966
When we give this glimpse to others,

18
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:07,988
then it is a source of entertainment for them,

19
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:11,667
and for those bloggers, there is a
chance to get fame and create an influence.

20
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:14,587
a chance to create an influence.

21
00:01:15,064 --> 00:01:17,977
Nowadays it also becomes
a huge career option.

22
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:23,903
Many times we also create such influence
which benefits socially, also do great things.

23
00:01:24,588 --> 00:01:26,435
I will also talk about
those great things,

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,590
must watch this
video till the end.

25
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:33,273
Before this video, I asked all
of you in a community post that

26
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:36,372
what do you get to learn from vloggers?

27
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:37,389
Got interesting reactions.

28
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,958
I would highly recommend commenting
through this post and read the comments.

29
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,159
If you have any interesting
observation then you must also comment.

30
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:47,925
I would love to react
to this on my Instagram.

31
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,775
Earn money by telling the
personal matter outside.

32
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:53,534
How to show off your big house?

33
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,767
Tell me, I am poor.

34
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:57,388
Teach to speak 'Guys' loudly.

35
00:01:58,063 --> 00:02:00,063
How to auction the privacy
of the house in public?

36
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:00,854
To go to jail.

37
00:02:02,304 --> 00:02:04,444
Flying the dog by tying it to a balloon.

38
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:08,130
They teach that the car can be rented.

39
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,556
'Ghanta'.

40
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:15,992
Is it wrong to earn money by
vlogging like this from YouTube?

41
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:17,502
I don't think this is wrong.

42
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:21,111
So many people who are in various positions

43
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:23,989
they earn so much money
through corruption, through cheating,

44
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:26,059
earn a lot of money
through manipulation,

45
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:27,868
then a person by working hard,

46
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,887
Means that when you are a small
vlogger, you don't have a team

47
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:33,335
you edit yourself and big
vloggers also edit themselves.

48
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:38,686
So I don't think there is any mistake if you
are entertaining someone by working so hard.

49
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,540
The mistake is when you set the wrong
example in your vlog due to wrong influence

50
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,487
encouraging people
to do wrong actions.

51
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,433
It is wrong to show fake
lifestyle in the name of content.

52
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:59,900
Making people feel zealousy, and
being absolutely fake and overly sweet

53
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:04,489
showing so many good things
that I think it's not possible.

54
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:08,625
Sometimes people go
fake, I think he is wrong.

55
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,539
And making mistakes one after the other and
not learning anything from that mistake,

56
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:13,615
not acknowledging and admitting mistake

57
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:18,334
and not telling audience that I've made a
mistake, and making many mistakes in a row.

58
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:19,751
What's not wrong?

59
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:23,459
It is not wrong when your mistake
has happened for the first time,

60
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:27,560
or the situation becomes
such that that thing looks wrong.

61
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:31,759
It is not wrong when you do a lot of such
things which are not discussed in the media,

62
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:35,145
but when you make a mistake
or someone misguides you

63
00:03:35,322 --> 00:03:36,822
and there are thousands of
discussions about that thing.

64
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:43,047
When you are socially aware, channel your
influence towards social initiatives too,

65
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,342
that is not wrong.

66
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:47,389
Teach people something
with your content.

67
00:03:47,414 --> 00:03:49,130
Something similar
happened with Flying Beast.

68
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,667
Such an incident
has happened to him,

69
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:54,633
which must have happened for
the first time in his vlogging career.

70
00:03:54,881 --> 00:04:02,634
So Ritu Bhabhi thought that I will
make Flying Beast's birthday in the metro.

71
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:08,087
She gave invitation to all 7 million
people to come to Sector 51 Noida.

72
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:10,406
Tomorrow is Gaurav's birthday.

73
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:12,932
And I have planned
such a wonderful surprise.

74
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,519
I have booked the entire metro for him.

75
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:19,167
Will make his birthday
there with all of you.

76
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:22,551
This is a surprise and don't
put any story by tagging him.

77
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:24,792
 You all come and we'll have a lot of fun.

78
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:28,242
Tomorrow1:30 pm, Sector 51 Noida.

79
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,313
I'm sure all these 7 million
people are not only from Noida

80
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:34,907
but also from Delhi, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad,
Faridabad and may be from some other state also.

81
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:38,041
How will these people let such an
opportunity pass, that too on Saturday?

82
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:40,756
A crowd gathered there.

83
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,683
There the traffic stopped,

84
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,727
whether it was an ambulance, whether someone
had an emergency, going to office or school

85
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,343
whether someone was going for
any emergency, they all stopped there.

86
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,307
were restrained, which was
not intentional, unintentional.

87
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,405
but they were restrained and
that's why this section is applicable.

88
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:03,558
You must be aware about the Covid situation
for which this section is applicable,

89
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,066
 but it has also been violeted.

90
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:09,622
Whether it happened
intentionally or unintentionally,

91
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:14,572
here Flying Beast is wrong, Ritu
Rathi is wrong or not, let's discuss.

92
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:17,789
Let's talk first, why
would she have done this?

93
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:22,400
The first reason that might
have come to your mind as well.

94
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,785
Is this Bhabhi's conspiracy?
-No!

95
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,733
Does Bhabhi wants him to leave the channel?
-No!

96
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:30,919
Was Bhabhi always plotting?
-No!

97
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:32,740
Was this Bhabhi's plan?
-No!

98
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:36,129
Was this her conscious plan?

99
00:05:36,307 --> 00:05:40,767
No, if it was Ekta Kapoor's
serial then it would have happened

100
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:42,244
but obviously there's nothing like that.

101
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:49,400
I think Ritu Bhabhi did this because she
genuinely wanted to give back something.

102
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,247
or may be wanted to make
his 36th birthday memorable.

103
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:58,605
so she did that, out of pure
genuinity and innocent emotion.

104
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:01,276
But what I expect from Ritu

105
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:04,252
is being more mature because
obviously she's captain, she's educated,

106
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,185
she know's about law.

107
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:07,819
I hope she know. So, this is tricky!

108
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:12,249
And I'll judge this thing on
5 grounds in a little while.

109
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,603
But before that let's talk about what other
reasons can be that Ritu Bhabhi did this.

110
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:19,633
First, obviously she wanted
to make his birthday special.

111
00:06:19,741 --> 00:06:20,695
I think she was misguided!

112
00:06:20,824 --> 00:06:23,937
Obviously Ritu bhabhi
would have reached out,

113
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:28,436
to people, agencies, management
agencies that how we can do this.

114
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:31,711
May be that idea was a misguidance!

115
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:35,299
She must have been misguided
that this can be managed.

116
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:37,280
There should be something different.

117
00:06:37,305 --> 00:06:42,995
You know, Gaurav and Ritu
never did any kind of controversies.

118
00:06:43,332 --> 00:06:47,092
There are many vloggers who
get views by doing controversy.

119
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,980
I react to controversy
because it is my content.

120
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:52,577
because I want to give perspective,
what is right what is wrong,

121
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:53,789
who is manipulating
you and who is not.

122
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:56,113
But this is not the content
of Ritu and Gaurav.

123
00:06:56,138 --> 00:06:58,807
There are many people whose content
is not like this, yet those people do.

124
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:00,481
But Gaurav never did that.

125
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,388
He has make this vlogging
channel purely on the basis of merit.

126
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:06,295
 I don't think it was a publicity stunt.

127
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:09,914
The psychology of vloggers
is to do something different,

128
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:12,931
and to make it different, it happened!

129
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:18,747
And whoever has this misguidance,
we should pay attention to it.

130
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:22,048
I will talk about that too but the third
reason, that why she would have done this.

131
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:24,490
I don't think it was a publicity stunt.

132
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,206
Psychology of vloggers is to do something
different and make it big, it may be.

133
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:33,656
As a vlogger, psychology challenges you,

134
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:37,550
stuck on this particular number
of what to do something different,

135
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:40,100
stuck on this subscriber base
and now how to go ahead,

136
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,077
 how to do something big and something new.

137
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:45,296
How should we return the
love back to the audience.

138
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:48,712
I think all this problem has
happened because of it.

139
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:51,194
Now let's talk whether he
should have been arrested or not.

140
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:54,471
I would like to discuss
this thing on five grounds.

141
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:55,764
First - Awareness.

142
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,932
Did they know about these sections?

143
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:00,527
Section 144, Covid situation.

144
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:01,753
I believe so.

145
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:05,068
Gaurav is IIT graduated
and both are captains.

146
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:08,860
Now Gaurav is also studying
Law, so I should believe.

147
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:09,672
There was awareness.

148
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,828
Now coming to the context.

149
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:14,001
Get carried away by emotions
She got carried away in emotions.

150
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:17,844
I'm making tea, after
that I'm going to get ready.

151
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:20,855
See you at 1:30. Bye!

152
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,909
Third - Intent!

153
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,555
Was it her intention that
people should suffer?

154
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:30,404
Was it their intention that we don't care
about law and order, as some people are saying.

155
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,087
I don't think so.

156
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,146
But, yes there intent was to do something big.

157
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:38,947
I'm 100% sure about it. Atleast,
from whatever perspective.

158
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:41,124
But to do something
big, that was their intent.

159
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:42,328
Fourth - Pattern.

160
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:44,201
 Is it their pattern to do all this? No!

161
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,842
As we discussed, there was no pattern.

162
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:49,147
But there is one thing, even though
Gaurav and Ritu did not have a pattern,

163
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:55,434
but all our political parties do.

164
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,059
Whatever the situation was, they did it.

165
00:08:57,723 --> 00:09:00,883
They've done it in much bigger numbers.

166
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:06,599
But if someone else does all
this and they are not punished,

167
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:08,822
then does it make you
right? I don't think so.

168
00:09:09,246 --> 00:09:13,093
If someone else is making a mistake,
do you get a license to make a mistake?

169
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,483
I don't think so!

170
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,329
I don't think so.

171
00:09:16,393 --> 00:09:18,393
So even on this basis I
wouldn't give them any point.

172
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:21,604
Even if their pattern is not
there, but there is a mistake.

173
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:24,221
Last but not he least is Responsibilty.

174
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:26,469
Was this a responsible act? No!

175
00:09:26,644 --> 00:09:28,590
This was not a responsible act at
all.  Because if we talk about health,

176
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:32,007
talk about covid, talk about
safety, talk about law and order,

177
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:34,437
then it was absolutely
wrong and irresponsible act.

178
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:36,805
Hello!

179
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:39,260
Hello!

180
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:43,610
Because with great powers,
comes great responsibility.

181
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:47,205
If this is the first mistake,
then it can be forgiven.

182
00:09:47,528 --> 00:09:50,587
But this mistake has to be
acknowledged, has to be discussed,

183
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:52,471
so that other mistakes don't happen.

184
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:55,637
Because as part of my
content, I always talk about

185
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:58,627
where creator gone wrong, in our
'Where creator gone wrong series'.

186
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:03,104
So, thisb  time this creator has
gone wrong, specially Bhabhi.

187
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:05,963
Specially when you talk
about 241, Wrongful Restraint!

188
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:08,689
How many ambulances would be there,
how many people would be in emergency,

189
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:11,104
when those people are
upset then there is a mistake.

190
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:14,257
I think there were many such risks in
this case which should have been forsee.

191
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:15,978
Anyone who is misguiding,

192
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:18,390
 Shouldn't have been agreed to him so soon.

193
00:10:18,415 --> 00:10:23,836
But, whether Ritu Bhabhi and Flying
Beast should have been arrested or not,

194
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:29,268
then they were arrested, it was right,
but they got bail, that was also right.

195
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,923
But my question is how many more people
who should have been arrested in this.

196
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:38,652
This is the whole process of approval,
when Bhabhi booked a metro coach,

197
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:41,580
under whom does the metro come?

198
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:46,076
The approval which is given is given on
whose basis, whose approval is involved,

199
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,344
what is its escalation
process, when approval is given

200
00:10:48,531 --> 00:10:52,471
then who interprets its repurcations.

201
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:57,632
Should the police be notified or not and by whom?

202
00:10:57,785 --> 00:10:59,840
Should the agency be arrested?

203
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,253
Should any government official be
fined, on the one who gave the approval?

204
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,596
Is this the result of inefficiency?

205
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:08,600
Is this the result
of negligence?

206
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:11,665
Is this matter only the result of the negligence of
Ritu and Gaurav or of many other administrations?

207
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,372
Is our administration useless?

208
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:16,496
These are many questions
that need to be asked.

209
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:22,099
And it also has to be asked that what
happens when these political rallies happen?

210
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,981
But at the same point of time, I
don't want to give creators excuse

211
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:29,635
If it happens, we can
do it too. No, you can't.

212
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,979
If a person is doing wrong
things then you cannot.

213
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:33,518
If someone else is selling tobacco,

214
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:37,115
then it's fine, their
principles are different.

215
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,717
But it doesn't give you the
liense to do the same mistake.

216
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:42,762
And what is happening, it is
not necessary that it is right.

217
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:46,496
And accepting what has been happening, because
it is happening like this, is also wrong.

218
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:52,145
So, that's why we shouldn't accept
and just take this as an excuse.

219
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:53,638
The reason is simple, guys

220
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:56,057
There is collective irresponsibilty.

221
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:57,721
There should be a collective penalty,

222
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:04,757
on all those departments which are involved
in this, everyone should be punished.

223
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:07,081
Media shouldn't just focus on one person,

224
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:10,917
it should focus on entire process
and the chain of events  linked to that.

225
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:12,748
That would be my submission, guys!

226
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:18,088
