1
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,200
'In a shanty in Mumbai, amidst
different middle class families..'

2
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,320
'..serving others day and night,
sitting beneath the stairs..'

3
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,760
'..the orphaned young man
who was successful in life..'

4
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,120
'This story is about
that innocent Bhola.'

5
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,720
Where has Bhola gone? He is
not to be seen since morning.

6
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,360
I too am searching for Bhola. God
knows where he has gone. - Bhola.

7
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,880
Renu, are you too
searching for Bhola?

8
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,320
Yes, Aunt Leela.

9
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,240
Father has been yelling for
the newspaper since morning.

10
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,280
He says, "I won't drink tea
until I get the newspaper."

11
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,120
What trouble is this! Oh, my God.

12
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,720
Bhola. Bhola.

13
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,520
Where has Bhola gone? It's
time for me to go to tuitions.

14
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,080
He still hasn't
got the shirt ironed.

15
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,560
He has gone to get it.
He will get it soon.

16
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,080
God knows when he will come.

17
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,440
You are harassing me for a shirt.

18
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,520
Bhola has come. Bhola has come.

19
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
Aunt. Aunt.

20
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,520
Bhola, you have come.
You got late today.

21
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,080
You left for the market so early.

22
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,240
What to do, Aunt?

23
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,640
Nowadays, market has
become a haggling shop.

24
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,800
It was so crowded. Here is
your grocery. - Give me.

25
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,080
It has chillies
worth Rs.2. And turmeric.

26
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,440
Okay.
- I am in a hurry.

27
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,320
Fine. Go quickly.
- Okay, Aunt.

28
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,720
"I won't eat fish. I
won't eat fish." - Bhola.

29
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,480
Brother, here is your ink.
- Okay.

30
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,080
And here are blank papers.

31
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,680
Bhola, well done. I will
write on these blank papers.

32
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,720
I will write beautiful
scripts and Gemini, B. R. Chopra..

33
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,520
..Vahini, I will
sell it to everybody.

34
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,640
And very soon, I will
become a famous writer. Bhola.

35
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,200
Brother, if I ever
become a producer..

36
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,080
..I will surely buy your story.

37
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,680
But I will first hear it.
- I will surely narrate it.

38
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,320
Sister, here is your
favourite rice. It's old rice.

39
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,480
Bhola, you are so nice.
So good. Bhola.

40
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,080
I will leave now.
- Okay.

41
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,600
Move.
- Okay.

42
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,800
Uncle, you are coughing.
Here is your medicine. Have it.

43
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,200
Bhola.
- Yes.

44
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,840
When is 'Ekadashi' (11th day
of the month)? - I don't know.

45
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,640
When you don't get to eat,
that day is 'Ekadashi'.

46
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,800
For me, 'Ekadashi' comes
three-four times a week.

47
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,400
Shut up. Tell me.
When is 'Ekadashi'?

48
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,640
According to the calendar,
it's tomorrow.

49
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,160
Tomorrow?
- Yes.

50
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
Aunt, your grocery.
It has everything.

51
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,320
Even fresh spices.

52
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,400
He is yelling so much.

53
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,280
If he is late for music tuition,
then nobody will hang him.

54
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,320
Where is my shirt?
Where is my shirt?

55
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,480
He is yelling the way Om
Prakash yelled in the movie 'Gopi'.

56
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,640
Sister, why are you yelling?

57
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
You always give examples of movies.

58
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,720
Be clear. So that even I
can understand something.

59
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,880
Bhola.
- He has come.

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,200
Bhola.
- Yes. - Where is my ironed shirt?

61
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,240
Here is your ironed shirt.

62
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,160
Great.

63
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,360
Great. He thinks that his musical
talent is hidden in his shirt.

64
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,000
The way in 'Bahut Din
Hue' the villain's life..

65
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,320
..dwelled in the parrot.

66
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Sister, again movies..
- Yes. Fine. Let it be. - Fine.

67
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,240
"Ramala, where are you going?"

68
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,120
Bhola. What's the arrival
time of Punjab Mail (train)?

69
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,640
Punjab Mail..

70
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Uncle, who is coming from Punjab?

71
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,440
My daughter, Gauri,
is coming from Agra.

72
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,200
What's the arrival time? - At times,
it's on time. At times, it's late.

73
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,360
But arrival time is 12.20.
- Sure?

74
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,240
You can confirm from the station.

75
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,560
The train from Delhi will
arrive on platform number three.

76
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,080
Bhola, what's
today's college time table?

77
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,200
What do I know? Ask him.

78
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,520
What will he know? He
just knows hotel menus.

79
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,880
Yes. What's the time table?

80
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,800
Physics in the
morning and then Practical.

81
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,760
And in the evening 'Kati
Patang' at the theatre.

82
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,080
"Love.."

83
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,200
Do we go to watch movies everyday?

84
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,520
Who said everyday?

85
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,480
You people watch movies
only seven times a week.

86
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,640
Seven times.
- Move.

87
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,280
Yes. As if you study everyday.

88
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,160
Ms. Renu. Look, what I got for you.

89
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,080
Detective book.

90
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,080
I was searching for
this book since long.

91
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,240
It's good that you brought it.

92
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,400
Renu, I have already read
all these books. - Is that so?

93
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,320
Shall I tell you the story?
- No.

94
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,640
Listen to me. Listen
to me. Listen to me.

95
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,600
There is a fight between
the detective and the hero.

96
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,160
Fight. Detective runs ahead.
The hero follows him.

97
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,360
And they both reach
a 20-storey building.

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't tell me. I
won't enjoy reading it.

99
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,520
Now, listen. After
reaching the building..

100
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,080
..the detective stands up.

101
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,080
He puts his hand in his pocket.

102
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,240
The hero thinks maybe he is
taking out his cigarette packet.

103
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,720
But no. He pulls out a gun
and not the cigarette packet.

104
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,480
Say pistol. Pistol.

105
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,720
Yes. Pistol.

106
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,240
And then he fires at the hero.

107
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,480
Does my hero die? Tell me quickly.

108
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
What happened to my hero?
Does he die? - No, no.

109
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,480
Ms. Renu, all the movies
made here and novels written..

110
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,160
Yes. - Does the hero
die in any of it? - No.

111
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,160
His enemies die. The hero had
emptied the bullets beforehand.

112
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,200
My hero doesn't die. I am fine.

113
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,720
Now, hear the climax.
- Yes.

114
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,080
It's the biggest suspense.

115
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,520
In the swimming pool with a
buffalo.. the hero has a fight.

116
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,080
Don't tell me. I
won't enjoy reading it.

117
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,080
Don't tell me.
- Here is your grocery.

118
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,360
Why did you bring onion?

119
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,640
Because it was cheap. Your
father likes fried onions.

120
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,600
Make it for him.
- Bhola. I want to shave my beard.

121
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,160
Which saloon should I go to?

122
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,440
Is it credit or cash?
- Today, credit.

123
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,160
It's Monday today. All
the shops are close.

124
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,720
I asked a fool.

125
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,720
Bhola, did you bring my cigarette?

126
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Cigarette? Sir.. sir, the
shopkeeper has closed your account.

127
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,400
Then you should have
brought it on your account.

128
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,800
I don't have an account, sir.

129
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,320
What can I do? I want
to use the bathroom.

130
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,280
I have got cigarette for that.

131
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,080
Give it to me. - But it's on
that fatso brother's account.

132
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,800
It's okay. It's okay.
Thanks a ton. Greetings.

133
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,400
"Do come to my village once."

134
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,680
"And when will you be
receptive to my love?"

135
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,640
Bhola. Bhola. Did
you bring my newspaper?

136
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,320
Sorry, Uncle. I forgot to
give you your newspaper.

137
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,480
Fine. Give this
yesterday's newspaper to Dindayal.

138
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,680
He will thank you. You
can have that thanks.

139
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,520
I should take his thanks. Fine.

140
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,000
This is great. Dindayal
pays for the newspaper.

141
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,720
And Makhan Lal reads it.
My work is over.

142
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,880
Let's go to college.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,200
How come my pot is behind?

144
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,360
Ask your pot.

145
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,200
Great. Does my pot have wings
that it will fly on its own.

146
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,640
What do we know?

147
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,480
We just know that we
came here two hours ago.

148
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
You came here two hours ago.

149
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,400
And I came in this
shanty ten years ago.

150
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,120
Bear it in mind. Don't forget it.

151
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,520
Great. You are ordering us
the way Shashikala ordered..

152
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,320
..in 'Sirf Paisa Ya Pyar.'

153
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,600
What commotion is this?
Always quarrels.

154
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,800
Come. Come, Prince.
Only you were amiss.

155
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,160
Come down.

156
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,000
Let me tell you that
you can't bully us.

157
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,200
Do I bully you all? - Of course.
What else are you doing?

158
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,360
Get lost.
- Shut up.

159
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,720
Shut up.
- I say keep quiet.

160
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,080
Quiet.
- You keep quiet.

161
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,640
Keep quiet.
- He is coming.

162
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,800
No matter who is coming.
What do we care?

163
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,120
Lorry is here. Sher Singh is coming.

164
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,360
Sher Singh.
- Oh, my God.

165
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,880
Come.

166
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,280
A short while ago,
there was a commotion.

167
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,480
And now, it's so quiet.

168
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,160
Sher Singh is coming.

169
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,120
Sher Singh. He is Sher
Singh and not Dara Singh.

170
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,120
Sher Singh, hello.
- Hello.

171
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:35,080
Lord, with your blessing,
everything is fine. Thank you.

172
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:43,080
Bhola, all of them
are fools. Lazy people.

173
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
None of them are useful.
Useless, all of them.

174
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,760
Sher Singh.
- Yes.

175
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,680
Nobody is useless in the world.

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,400
Some people whose
help we don't take..

177
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,560
..and who are related to us..
they are useless for us.

178
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,600
Now, take my example.
Do you give me any work?

179
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,240
No. - No, right. Doesn't
that make me useless for you?

180
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,440
Bhola. Why has God
given me two hands? - Why?

181
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,880
To do my own work.
Haven't you heard?

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,680
Hands are everything.

183
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,720
Mister.
- Yes.

184
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,440
Is there no work in the
world which you can't do?

185
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,680
Mr. Bhola.
- Yes.

186
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,120
There is no work
which a devotee can't do.

187
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,520
Then do one thing.
- Tell me.

188
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,000
The hen which hatches from an egg..

189
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,800
..put the hen back into the egg.
- What?

190
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,360
Yes.
- Hey.

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,200
Loafer.

192
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,200
This is the food made with love.
- Food?

193
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,360
Yes. Until you don't
call me loafer, I can't eat.

194
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,720
I can't sleep.

195
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:51,080
Bhola, don't you ever feel
bad when I call you loafer?

196
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,400
No, Brother.

197
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,280
Even a police officer calls
his child as thief, ruffian.

198
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,200
So, does the child really
become a thief or a ruffian?

199
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,440
Enough. Enough.

200
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,560
Now, you take a break.
And leave. Let me work.

201
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,080
Fine, Brother. You too calm down.

202
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,680
And eat something.

203
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,520
But don't eat too much.
Otherwise, you might fall sick.

204
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,280
Loafer.

205
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,480
Loafer.

206
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,320
What's the matter?

207
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,640
I think he is not
going to college today.

208
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,000
Because he has still not eaten.

209
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,080
What is he eating nowadays?

210
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,800
Fatso, Bhola doesn't
eat meagre meals like us.

211
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,080
He has rich meals day and night.

212
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,520
No. When Bhola goes
with his plate and says..

213
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,600
.."Bhola has come, Bhola
has come", he gets food.

214
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,440
Bhola has come. Bhola has come.

215
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,880
The lunch is still not ready.
It will take some time.

216
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,840
Aunt, I will be late for my college.

217
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,640
So, what should I do?
Always cook for you?

218
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,280
Not always, Aunt. At times.

219
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,800
You are hungry and still
you are acting smugly.

220
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,640
If you are so hungry,
then eat grass.

221
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,640
Aunt, I remembered
you wanted kerosene.

222
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,000
Take out the container. I
will bring it in the evening.

223
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,200
If not you, then will
I bring the kerosene.

224
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,200
Bhola has come. Bhola has come.

225
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,560
Bhola has come.

226
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,280
Everyday you are here. You
are not talking anything new.

227
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,240
Mr. Anand, aunt must have
understood what I meant.

228
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,720
She must have understood.

229
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,240
Why don't you clearly say
that I have come to beg?

230
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,480
Mr. Anand.

231
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,680
Why don't you beg and say
"Give me something to eat?"

232
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,160
I am hungry. You act proud.
And you beg.

233
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,800
What did you say? Say it again.

234
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,880
If you say that again,
then I will not spare you.

235
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,000
Nobody does a favour to Bhola..

236
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,200
..by giving him meals.

237
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,760
He serves everybody diligently.

238
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,120
He studies in college.
He passes with good marks.

239
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,400
He receives scholarship.

240
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,080
He is not indebted to anybody.
But we are indebted to him.

241
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,760
You should learn from him.

242
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,120
Anand's mother. Bhola has come.

243
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,520
Why do you scold Anand?

244
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,800
Anand says it jokingly.
He is not serious.

245
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,480
That is fine, Bhola.
But he is insensible.

246
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,680
Don't say that, Uncle.

247
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,800
What mistake has Anand committed?

248
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,000
Even if he has committed a mistake..

249
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,200
..still it's the fault of his age.

250
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,680
Gradually, he will become sensible.

251
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,080
Here, Bhola.

252
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,080
Did you hear Bhola?
- I hear him everyday.

253
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,080
Everybody scolds him.

254
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,080
And this poor guy praises them.

255
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,640
You are right.

256
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,800
Bhola, eat.

257
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,520
Mother.
- Sister. Sister.

258
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,560
Gauri. My child. You have come.

259
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,080
I was craving to see you.

260
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,560
Sister, I brought
Gauri safe and sound.

261
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,520
Thank You, God.
- Brother-in-law. - Yes.

262
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,200
Why didn't you take the
change from the cab driver?

263
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,120
No.
- It doesn't look good.

264
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,000
Don't talk to anybody. And
don't go to anybody's house.

265
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,720
Why, Mother?
- Dear, we don't live in a bungalow.

266
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,160
We live in a shanty.

267
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,200
And you have to be
careful in a shanty.

268
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,520
Here, different people
say different things.

269
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,000
Dear, if people came
to know about you..

270
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,400
..then it will be
difficult to get you married.

271
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,360
Brother-in-law, I am fed
up of travelling in a train.

272
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
What happened? - When it departed,
it was a mail train.

273
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,240
And upon reaching here, it
became a commodities train.

274
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,080
Even I have travelled in a train.

275
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,360
Sister, I have kept a
cap in the cab. Bring that.

276
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,320
Got it? Got it? You go inside.
I will just come.

277
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,160
What's your name?

278
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,280
Why are you laughing? Go inside.

279
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,720
Hello, Dindayal.

280
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,440
Hello. Come. Sit.

281
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,720
I have heard that
your daughter has come.

282
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,240
Yes. Today, I have
come to you for an advice.

283
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,560
Tell me. - I have to think
about Gauri's marriage too.

284
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,080
Did you talk to anybody?

285
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,240
Makhan Lal.
- The one who reads the newspaper.

286
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,520
Yes. How about his son Jeevan?

287
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,680
The boy is good. But
I think he smokes.

288
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,760
Dindayal, nowadays,
it's a trend to smoke.

289
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,720
I have heard he has
cleared his B.A. (Arts course).

290
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
And he has a government job.

291
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,000
Yes. Whether he
receives a raise or not..

292
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,120
..but the expenses do increase.

293
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,600
I think Makhan Lal
will surely listen to you.

294
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,320
Will you come with me?

295
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,160
Definitely. I am a retired
old man. I should do something.

296
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,880
Let's go. Why delay a good cause?

297
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,800
Makhan Lal, your son
Jeevan and his daughter Gauri..

298
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,080
..both form a good pair.

299
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,480
If you give consent
for this alliance..

300
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,280
..I will consider
it my good fortune.

301
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,000
When he told me
about this alliance..

302
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,880
..I thought why to delay
the good cause, let's go.

303
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,320
Makhan Lal.

304
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,120
Do you accept this alliance?

305
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,280
Alliance? What alliance?

306
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,120
Father. Father, they are
talking about the marriage alliance.

307
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,720
Marriage? Whose marriage?

308
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,560
Oh, my God.

309
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,800
Look, father
understands only newspapers.

310
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,160
So, do one thing.

311
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,680
Get brother Jeevan
and Gauri married.

312
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,480
And print this
news in the newspaper.

313
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,640
Father will read and understand it.

314
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,520
Oh, my God. I can't read the
newspaper calmly in this house.

315
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,680
Look, you people don't mind father.

316
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,080
We will come to
see the girl someday.

317
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,080
Renu.
- Brother has come.

318
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,240
Is tea ready?

319
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,200
Brother, they have come to
talk about your marriage.

320
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,760
Hello.
- Hello. Hello. - Hello, dear.

321
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,080
Did you have tea?
- No problem. Fine. Fine.

322
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,280
He is my brother.

323
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,840
Look. I don't like to praise myself.

324
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,560
But there is no vice in me. I
don't smoke cigarette or cigar.

325
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,360
I don't drink beer or whiskey.
And I don't accept bribe.

326
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,760
Not at all. - I have one weakness.
I do lie often.

327
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,640
Great, Jeevan. You
seem to be a jolly man.

328
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,120
Another special thing.
- What?

329
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,280
I always respect elders.
- That's too good.

330
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,280
Now, I am going to smoke.

331
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,080
Now, we will leave.
- Greetings.

332
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,240
Greetings.

333
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,360
What is this?
- What?

334
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,080
Renu, how does the girl
look like? Is she pretty?

335
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,000
Like Sharmila in 'Aradhana'?

336
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,400
We have still not seen her.

337
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,720
They have hidden her as if
somebody might cast an evil eye.

338
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,360
How can they hide her?

339
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,280
She will come for the engagement,
won't she?

340
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,800
It's getting late. Call the bride.
- Yes. Call her.

341
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,080
Yes. Call her.

342
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,400
The good deed should
begin at the auspicious time.

343
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,560
"Auspicious.."

344
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,240
Oh, my God. The heroine in a
Marathi film looked just like her.

345
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,760
Your name?
- Gauri. Gauri.

346
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Who asked you? Go do your work.

347
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,480
Like your mother, do you too
know how to prepare sweets?

348
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,400
Hey. Hey.
- What?

349
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,800
I have seen this girl somewhere.

350
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,080
Where? She has come from
Agra yesterday. - Exactly.

351
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,560
I had gone to Agra to
meet Govinda's nephew..

352
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,400
He is in a mental asylum.

353
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,200
Yes. I saw this girl there.
In the mental asylum.

354
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,480
I see. So, you go to
mental asylum to see girls.

355
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,520
No. I..

356
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,640
Fine. Let it be. We will
talk about this later.

357
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,320
But did you see this
girl in the mental asylum?

358
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,080
Yes. I am sure.

359
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,800
Are you sure she is
that same insane girl?

360
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,080
Yes. I am sure. She
is that insane girl.

361
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,080
I saw an insane girl
in 'Waaris' movie.

362
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,640
Hema Malini acted so well.
- Acted so well.

363
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,680
But this is not acting.
She is really mad.

364
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,880
I see. That's why
you had hidden Gauri.

365
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,440
Is it true that Gauri
was in the mental asylum?

366
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,160
Tell me. Why are you quiet?
Why are you quiet?

367
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,480
Dear, this is true.

368
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,000
Did you hear that, Brother Jeevan?

369
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,280
Now, why are you sitting? Get up.

370
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,640
Dear. Dear.

371
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,080
Jeevan, have patience.
Listen to what he has to say.

372
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,000
Listen to me. Listen to me, dear.

373
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,360
Leave. Why didn't
you tell me before?

374
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,640
Dear, there was no need to tell you.

375
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,400
Now, she is well. Now,
she is not mad, dear.

376
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,720
What's the guarantee
that she is not mad?

377
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,640
Renu, what's the guarantee
that you won't go crazy tomorrow?

378
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,520
Shut up.
- Bhola. Keep quiet.

379
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,680
This engagement won't take place.

380
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,000
Come on, Brother Jeevan. Get up.

381
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,600
Jeevan. Jeevan.

382
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,240
Why are you all quiet?
Explain to him.

383
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,080
You explain to him.

384
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,080
Great. The girl is mad.

385
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,680
And you are saying
to explain to the guy.

386
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,880
Let me talk. Marriage lasts for
the whole life. I am a stranger.

387
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,160
I don't have the right
to interfere. Am I right?

388
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,200
Yes. Let's go.
- Come on.

389
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,560
Jeevan, you are an
educated guy. You are sensible.

390
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,120
You know what is
right and what is wrong.

391
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,440
If there is a vice, then
you should rectify it.

392
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,280
You shouldn't throw it out.

393
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,000
Is it right to hide
your daughter's vice..

394
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
..and conduct the marriage quickly?

395
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,720
Why are you arguing?
Come to the point.

396
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,560
Give Rs.15000 in cash. Only then
will this marriage take place.

397
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,480
Rs.15000.
- Yes.

398
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,760
Dowry.
- Don't call it dowry.

399
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,720
By calling it dowry, it
will become a business.

400
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,680
Call it a gift.

401
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,640
Jeevan, it's wrong to
turn back on your words.

402
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,080
Rs.15000 is not an ordinary amount.

403
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,120
Jeevan, Rs.15000 has
three zeroes in it.

404
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,280
I don't know all that.

405
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,240
You don't even know that
Rs.15000 has three zeroes.

406
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,680
You keep quiet. You keep quiet.

407
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,520
Jeevan, I can only give you
Rs.5,000. Not more than that.

408
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,560
We want Rs.15000.
And that too in a day.

409
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,000
Dear, even if I sell
everything I have..

410
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,160
..I will be able to
give only Rs.6000-Rs.7000.

411
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,800
Do say yes. Do say yes, dear.

412
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,080
And accept this engagement.

413
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,800
Not Rs.6000-Rs.7000.
I want Rs.15000.

414
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,880
Father, is the deal over? It's
okay if you have to give more.

415
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,520
You will get rid of me.

416
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,680
Gauri.

417
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,720
If you don't want to marry,
then leave.

418
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,280
Forget Rs.15000. You
won't even get 15 paisa.

419
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,480
Leave.

420
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,240
Mad. She is mad. She
is definitely mad.

421
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,160
Yes, I am mad.
Nobody should marry me.

422
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,760
Leave. Leave. I say leave.

423
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,160
Father.

424
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,320
Father, let's go.
- What happened?

425
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,480
Is the engagement over?

426
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,720
Oh, my God. Come.
- Let's go.

427
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,840
Gauri. Gauri. My dear.

428
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,880
Gauri.

429
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,560
"Oh, moon."

430
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,880
"Oh, moon."

431
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,400
"Who stole your and my slumber?"

432
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,800
"We stayed awake the whole night."

433
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,760
"You and I."

434
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,680
"We stayed awake the whole night."

435
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,120
"You and I."

436
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,280
"Oh, moon."

437
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,480
"Oh, moon."

438
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,120
"Who stole your and my slumber?"

439
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,440
"We stayed awake the whole night."

440
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,360
"You and I."

441
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,400
"We stayed awake the whole night."

442
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,760
"You and I."

443
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,120
"Your and my story is the same."

444
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:15,120
"Nobody understood us."

445
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,160
"Our story is the same."

446
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,760
"Nobody understood us."

447
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,800
"Our companion is this darkness."

448
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,080
"We stayed awake the whole night."

449
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,680
"You and I."

450
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,680
"Oh, moon."

451
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,120
"Oh, moon."

452
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,440
"Who stole your and my slumber?"

453
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,080
"We stayed awake the whole night."

454
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,880
"You and I."

455
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,480
"The whole world is asleep,
lost in dreams."

456
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,400
"Nobody asks for you and me."

457
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,600
"The whole world is asleep,
lost in dreams."

458
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,200
"Nobody asks for you and me."

459
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:51,120
"Come, let's talk
and spend the night."

460
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,320
"We stayed awake the whole night."

461
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,120
"You and I."

462
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,760
"Oh, moon."

463
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,160
"Oh, moon."

464
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,520
"Who stole your and my slumber?"

465
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,080
"We stayed awake the whole night."

466
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,680
"You and I."

467
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,640
"We stayed awake the whole night."

468
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,200
"You and I."

469
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,600
Uncle. I am leaving for college.

470
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,800
Fine.

471
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,880
Bhola, quickly bring a cab for me.

472
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,440
Cab? Fine. I will just get it.

473
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
Listen. Won't you
take your umbrella?

474
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,160
No. Today, I don't
need the umbrella.

475
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,600
I will go in a cab today.

476
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,520
Shall I leave?
- Don't you feel ashamed?

477
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,680
What should I get for you today?

478
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,800
Rose, jasmine, powder or snow?

479
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,320
Your cheeks are so red.

480
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,200
Oh, my God. The cab is here.

481
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,360
What are you doing here?

482
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,080
I didn't see anything.
I didn't see anything.

483
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,400
Leave. I will come.
- Yes.

484
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,400
Hey. Bye.

485
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,200
Uncle, I will leave.

486
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,680
I forgot to give
medicine to grandpa.

487
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,160
Come, Grandpa.

488
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,720
They give this poor guy
one meal in seven days.

489
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,360
And in a day, they give
him seven chores to do.

490
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,160
He serves this coughing
grandpa day and night.

491
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,240
Go to college quickly.

492
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,560
Otherwise, somebody
will call you again. Go.

493
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,480
Run. - Okay, uncle. - Bhola.
Did you eat well?

494
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,640
Aunt, what work do you have?

495
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,200
Bhola is so intelligent.

496
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,600
He understands everything
without having to explain to him.

497
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,200
Bhola, I have given wheat
for grinding. Go and bring it.

498
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,240
Bhola is getting late.
He has to go to college.

499
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,120
He can go anywhere he wants to.
I am not stopping him.

500
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,640
Everybody gives him chores
to do. I am not the only one.

501
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,800
Did you hear that, Bhola?

502
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,240
Uncle, you listen to her. I
will get the flour from the shop.

503
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,000
I know everything. I am not kind.

504
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,480
I don't let Bhola study.

505
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,640
When did I say that?

506
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,760
If you didn't, then say it now.

507
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,160
You have retired. What
other work do you have?

508
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,800
Instead of speaking ill
of others, worship God.

509
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,240
Your old age will be reformed.

510
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,880
Leela, keep quiet. What old age?

511
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,280
Who are you calling old?
He is still healthy.

512
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,160
He does all his work.

513
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,600
Then why does he
interfere in others' matters?

514
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,800
Always nosing around.

515
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,680
Why do you interfere in
others' matters? Come inside.

516
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,320
Do come.

517
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,600
Bhola will bring the flour
and he is having a problem.

518
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,560
What a man!

519
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,560
Aunt.
- You have come.

520
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,080
You dropped it, fool.

521
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,800
Now, I will never give
you any chore to do.

522
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,080
I give you work and
the lawyer feels bad.

523
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,360
He interferes in others' matter.

524
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,720
Great. What a strange man. Great.

525
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,280
Aunt, your container.
- Fool, get lost.

526
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,400
Uncle, what commotion was this?

527
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,000
Before there is any other problem..

528
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,240
..quickly go to college.

529
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,640
Here are your books. Go. Go.

530
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,720
Vivek. It's time to go
to college. Hurry up.

531
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,880
Yes. Coming.

532
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,200
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Bhola.

533
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,800
Daddy, today, this
ever-late man has come on time.

534
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,280
Otherwise everyday he is late.

535
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,880
No, sir. Nowadays, the clock in the
college ticks fast. - Is that so?

536
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,000
Why don't you say that
after doing the chores..

537
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,200
..of the people in that shanty,
you come to college.

538
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,080
Bhola, if you did other's
chores then what about your studies?

539
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,880
What about your
desire to stand first?

540
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,080
Look, Bhola. Do one thing.

541
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
I will get a rented flat for you.

542
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
Stay there. Study
well and come first.

543
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,520
Sir, you have helped me
enough by giving me these books.

544
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,800
I am burdened by your favours.

545
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,000
Sir, if I leave that shanty
then the people living there..

546
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,400
..will face problems.

547
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,160
Daddy, it's useless to tell him.

548
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,480
He won't even go to live in heaven,
leaving that shanty.

549
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,200
Sir, you don't worry.

550
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,480
In spite of living in that shanty,
I will try to come first.

551
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,080
Bhola, when you are so
confident about yourself..

552
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,240
..then what else do I need?

553
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,320
This mad girl is washing vessels.

554
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,160
Whether she is mad or not,
this girl is very sharp.

555
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,680
Shut up.

556
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,240
Her hair style
shows she is Cleopatra.

557
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,360
Cleopatra is staring at us.

558
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,240
So what? You do your work.

559
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,400
Is that so?
- Yes.

560
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,360
"Mad girl left the house."

561
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,120
"Like a flower."

562
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,400
"Mad girl.."

563
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,080
Who are you calling mad? Who is mad?

564
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,360
Look at this. We felt
like singing, so, we sang.

565
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,880
Why were you singing looking at me?

566
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,680
If not you, then would they
have looked at me and sang?

567
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,560
Song of a mad girl for a mad girl.

568
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,400
Mad? I am mad?

569
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,320
What are you doing?

570
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,720
Have you gone insane? Run.

571
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,160
Oh, my God.

572
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,160
She has gone..

573
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,600
Bhola, run.

574
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,800
Fool. What are you doing?
- Leave.

575
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,160
Leave. Come inside.
Come. I say come inside.

576
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,400
Mad.

577
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,200
She is completely crazy.

578
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,480
Sit here quietly.

579
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,080
I was quietly doing my work.

580
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,320
They started
singing when they saw me.

581
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,080
And you started
throwing the vessels at them.

582
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,800
Won't I feel bad
if they call me mad?

583
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,360
Fine. Come. Come.

584
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,640
If anybody else
teases me, then remember.

585
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,800
I will break your head.

586
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,600
You don't listen to me.

587
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,560
If you venture out again,
I will break your legs.

588
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,720
Get in. Come on.

589
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,880
Because of you, we are
slandered in the shanty.

590
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,760
If you do anything,
I won't spare you.

591
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,280
Stay here quietly. Unlucky.

592
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,360
Bhola has come. Bhola has come.

593
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,400
What are you doing?

594
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,080
Mother, Bhola has come.
- So what?

595
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,480
Say that we gave him food yesterday.

596
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,360
Does it mean he
won't feel hungry today?

597
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,480
So, what can we do? Our turn
will come after four days.

598
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,520
But everyday, you
order him to do your work.

599
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,680
Again she has started arguing.

600
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,720
It was better if she had
stayed in the mental asylum.

601
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,360
Here.

602
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,200
No. My appetite is full.

603
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,640
Not one or two, ten people come.

604
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,680
They eat and then leave.
They don't even look back.

605
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,600
So what?

606
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,880
I am worried about your marriage.

607
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,440
I will somehow get married.

608
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,200
I am worried and you are joking.

609
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,480
God knows what
fate you have brought.

610
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,400
God knows when
this wailing will end.

611
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,720
He is crying. And you are
irritating me with your yells.

612
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,600
I am singing. And you are
saying I am yelling. - Of course.

613
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,760
It's said that children go to
sleep upon hearing songs. - Yes.

614
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,280
But hearing your song, even
the old people will wake up.

615
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,800
So hoarse.

616
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,240
Listen, Jaya. You are my wife.

617
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,320
Even my hoarse voice
should sound sweet to you.

618
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,280
It's a wife's duty
to praise her husband.

619
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,480
Enough. Stop this speech.

620
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,520
Today's women treat
people as a doctor.

621
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,560
And like a minister,
she rules the country.

622
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,280
I know. I know.

623
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,440
Jaya, do one thing.

624
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,800
Give the wailing child to him.

625
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,120
Give that wailing problem to him.

626
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,760
Bhola, stop studying.
- Why?

627
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
Keep the book aside
and look after the child.

628
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,520
Put him to sleep. - I have
got my English test tomorrow.

629
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,360
I was reciting Shakespeare.

630
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,120
Great. You are remembering the dead.

631
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
And you are forgetting the
one who is alive. - But..

632
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,480
Nothing doing. Put him to sleep.
- But..

633
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,760
Want to hear Shakespeare? Listen.

634
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,120
Friends, Romans, countrymen.

635
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,760
Lend me your ears. I
have come to bury Caesar.

636
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,560
Not to praise him. Liked it? No.

637
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,880
I will recite
something else. Another idea.

638
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,680
"Friends, Romans, countrymen."

639
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,080
"A child is crying."

640
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,240
"Friends, Romans, countrymen."

641
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,520
"A child is crying."

642
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,640
"Lend me your ears. I
have come to bury Caesar."

643
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,760
"I have come to bury Caesar.
Not to praise him."

644
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,080
"Friends, Romans, countrymen."

645
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,200
"A child is crying."

646
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,200
Liked it? No. You
don't like Shakespeare.

647
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,360
Want to hear Kalidas?

648
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,680
Want to hear Kalidas? No.
Then what to do?

649
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,880
What to do?

650
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,760
"Oh, moon."

651
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,800
"Oh, moon."

652
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,160
"Who stole your and my slumber?"

653
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,360
"We stayed awake the whole night."

654
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,200
"You and I."

655
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,000
"We stayed awake the whole night."

656
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,400
"You and I."

657
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,640
"I will smile and entertain you."

658
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:47,160
"But who shall I show my tears to?"

659
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:53,160
"I will smile and entertain you."

660
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:59,400
"But who shall I show my tears to?"

661
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:06,080
"I have spent all my life alone."

662
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,200
"We stayed awake the whole night."

663
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,600
"You and I."

664
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,320
"Oh, moon."

665
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,360
"Oh, moon."

666
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:24,680
"Who stole your and my slumber?"

667
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,080
"We stayed awake the whole night."

668
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,800
"You and I."

669
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,440
"We stayed awake the whole night."

670
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,120
"You and I."

671
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,480
"Your and my story is the same."

672
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,880
"Nobody understood us."

673
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:15,080
"Your and my story is the same."

674
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,240
"Nobody understood us."

675
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:27,720
"Your and my
companion is this darkness."

676
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,000
"We stayed awake the whole night."

677
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,720
"You and I."

678
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,200
"Oh, moon."

679
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,200
"Oh, moon."

680
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,480
"Who stole your and my slumber?"

681
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,720
"We stayed awake the whole night."

682
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,480
"You and I."

683
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,160
"We stayed awake the whole night."

684
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,320
"You and I."

685
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,880
Listen, Bhola..
- Yes.

686
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,600
He is very innocent.
- Yes.

687
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,160
But he is very clever.

688
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,720
He will finish his
education and settle down. - Yes.

689
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,560
How is Bhola for our Gauri?

690
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,120
Not bad, Gauri's mother.
But what if he refuses?

691
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,680
He doesn't have the right to refuse.

692
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,160
Everyday, he comes to
our door hungry and says..

693
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,320
"Aunt, Bhola has come,
Bhola has come."

694
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,440
We give him food to eat.
And he will refuse us?

695
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,760
Let him dare to say no.

696
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,280
Fine. But keep quiet now.
His exams are approaching.

697
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,320
If he passes B.A., then
we will talk about it.

698
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,440
But now, don't let anybody know.
- Fine.

699
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,600
Okay?
- Have tea.

700
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,480
Brother.
- Yes.

701
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,080
Brother.
- Yes.

702
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,640
This is unfair, this is injustice,
this is deceit.

703
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,800
If you are hungry, then eat hot
food. Why are you being angry?

704
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,560
I am not hungry. This is deceit.

705
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,880
Plans are being made
to push me in the well.

706
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,880
Well? Don't worry. I
will pull you out.

707
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,560
Not me, you will pull out my body.

708
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,720
What do you mean?

709
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,520
That mad girl..
- Gauri.

710
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,520
They want me to marry her.
- How is that possible?

711
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,080
Yes, Brother. I heard
her parents talking.

712
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,640
They don't have the
right to talk about you.

713
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,120
Refuse them.

714
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,080
How, Brother?

715
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,240
They are richer than me.

716
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,080
Everyday, I implore to them saying..

717
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,880
"Bhola has come, Bhola has come."

718
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,080
How can I refuse them?

719
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,760
Even if I tell them something,
will they listen to me?

720
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,600
No. Never. Because they feed me.

721
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,280
They want to give meagre meals..

722
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,160
..and let you have her mad daughter.

723
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,280
I won't let this happen. I
will teach them a lesson.

724
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,360
I will..
- No, Brother. Don't abuse them.

725
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,120
It's not right to
quarrel with them for me.

726
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,000
The ailment which is incurable..

727
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,320
..you should silently endure it.

728
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,600
Bhola.
- Yes, Brother.

729
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,080
But I have found a
solution for that. - What?

730
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,080
They want to deceive me.
Before that, I will deceive them.

731
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,080
What will you do? - I.. I will
start loving that crazy girl.

732
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,520
And I will say that this
girl is not a stranger for me.

733
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,560
I have loved her a long time ago.

734
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,320
We are old acquaintance.

735
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,240
Bhola.
- Yes, Brother.

736
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:04,080
Instead of being dejected,
its better to expect dejection.

737
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,000
So that the
dejection doesn't hurt him.

738
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,160
It doesn't hurt him.

739
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,280
Great, Bhola. Great. You
have taken the right decision.

740
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,800
The outcome too will be good.

741
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,120
Don't worry. God willing, that
girl too will get well. Just watch.

742
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,800
Brother, do you think I am
doing the right thing? - Yes.

743
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,320
So, shall I start loving
that mad girl? - Yes. Go ahead.

744
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,800
Yes. Go ahead. What do you care?

745
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,600
You will just watch the show.
And I will face the music.

746
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,440
Don't worry. Bhola's
love will be eternal.

747
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,320
Bhola's love will be eternal.
Bhola's love will be eternal.

748
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,880
Bhola will be in the hospital.

749
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,400
How to love her?
Very difficult question.

750
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,080
Take the help of the book.

751
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,120
Lovers are beaten. Oh, my God.

752
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,880
Another book..

753
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,120
Heartaches. Before loving. No.

754
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,240
What to do? I will
have to love Gauri.

755
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,120
How to talk to her?
How to call her outside?

756
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,320
Idea. I will tease her
and she will come outside.

757
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,520
"Mad girl has left the house."

758
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,520
"Like a flower."

759
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,200
"Biting her finger,
she has gone wild.."

760
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,600
"Mad girl."

761
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,560
What did you say?
- Nothing. Nothing.

762
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:44,600
No. No. No.

763
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,400
Listen. Listen. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Listen.

764
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,360
What did you say?
- Nothing.

765
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,520
Why did you sing that song?

766
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,600
Just like that. I am
telling the truth.

767
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,520
I didn't sing that
song to tease you.

768
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,400
I sang that song to call you out.

769
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,560
Now, say.
- Why are you scared of me?

770
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,800
What are you doing?
Look, the well is here.

771
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,080
If I fell down then I will die.

772
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,880
Bhola will be down.
And bubbles will come up.

773
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,680
Brother.

774
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,000
Why do you get
scared when you see me?

775
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,160
The way a mouse is
afraid of the cat.

776
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,640
Don't you pity me?

777
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,520
Yes. Nowadays, I pity you a bit.
Earlier, I was really scared.

778
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,600
But now, my fear is reducing.

779
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,400
And my heart says to talk to you.

780
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,200
Gauri, why are you quiet?

781
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,280
If I say something,
people say that I am mad.

782
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,480
Then you keep quiet.

783
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,240
When I keep quiet, still
people say that I am mad.

784
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,480
Then say something. Talk.

785
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,080
Otherwise, nothing will happen.

786
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,800
You talk and I will talk.
- What should I say?

787
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,640
Anything. About your life,
about your childhood.

788
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,320
What do I say about my life?

789
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,000
I can only say that it
would have been better..

790
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,800
..if I had not been born.

791
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,760
No. You shouldn't say that.

792
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,840
Gauri, if I ask you something,
will you feel bad?

793
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,160
No, Bhola. Why will I feel
bad if you say something good?

794
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,080
Nobody talks properly to me.

795
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,080
But you talk sweetly.

796
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,640
But that day, I
mean with Mr. Jeevan..

797
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,560
..on the engagement day,
your ferocious form..

798
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,440
Throwing vessels.

799
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,640
If somebody calls a girl
mad and asks for Rs.15000..

800
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,240
..in front of
everybody humiliates her..

801
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,760
..then forget me,
any girl will do this.

802
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,480
Gauri, you throw vessels on others.

803
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,400
So, they call you mad.

804
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,080
They call you mad, so,
you throw vessels at them.

805
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,200
There is a problem.
There is only one solution.

806
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,080
Not to get angry. And
think about harmony.

807
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,160
I mean like other girls,
behave politely.

808
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,360
What do I know how
other girls behave?

809
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,680
I was in the mental
asylum for ten years.

810
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,800
What do I know how
the outside world is?

811
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,080
I just know that now I am not mad.

812
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,880
People living here are mad.

813
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,640
Somebody is crazy for music,
somebody for movies.

814
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,000
Somebody is crazy for clothes..

815
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,240
..somebody for jewellery.

816
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,720
And everybody is crazy for money.

817
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,280
They all might be mad.

818
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,440
That doesn't mean that they
can call me mad all the time.

819
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:27,520
Gauri. Gauri, don't cry. I
can't see anybody crying.

820
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,120
I too can't endure this injustice.

821
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,560
Till date, nobody consoled me.

822
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,000
Bhola, you will talk
to me considering me..

823
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,320
..to be a nice girl, won't you?

824
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,200
Will I? I will have to do it.
I will have to talk a lot.

825
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,080
Otherwise, how will my plan succeed?

826
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,080
Plan? What plan?
- Nothing. Nothing.

827
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,240
What is this, Bhola?

828
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,080
Just now you were saying
that we will talk a lot.

829
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,120
And now, you have
become so quiet. Why?

830
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,080
Gauri, there is a problem.

831
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,520
A lot of families
live in this shanty.

832
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,480
How will we talk alone?

833
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,480
Why? You call me and I will come.
- But how?

834
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,600
How did you call me just now?
- By singing.

835
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,520
So sing.
- Okay.

836
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,760
"Mad girl."

837
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,800
I told you to call me and
you are calling the mad girl.

838
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,080
Sorry. But which other song to sing?

839
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:22,120
"My songs are calling you."

840
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,360
"My songs."

841
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,400
"My beloved."

842
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,880
Did you hear this song?
- Yes.

843
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,080
We will sing this song.
- Okay.

844
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,440
The work is done.

845
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,160
I will sing this song when I
want to talk to you. And you come.

846
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,280
If you sing melodiously,
I will definitely come.

847
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,880
Gauri.

848
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,280
Your mother is calling you?
- Yes.

849
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,560
Mother.

850
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,480
Gauri. Where have you gone?

851
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,080
Gauri. Gauri.

852
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,240
Move.

853
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,400
Aunt, Gauri is not here.
Greetings, Aunt. How are you?

854
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,560
Are you fine?

855
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,480
Why are you being worried
about me all of a sudden?

856
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,160
Aunt, you look so thin.
Are you not well?

857
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,000
What nonsense!

858
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,080
I am not talking nonsense. I
am swaying the wraparound.

859
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,800
What. - No, no. I am washing..
no, drying the wraparound.

860
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,080
Do you have to talk for that?

861
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,800
Yes, Aunt. If we talk, we exhale.
It dries the wraparound.

862
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,400
Sari. Sari.

863
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,160
Why are you harping about sari?

864
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,880
Aunt, I was saying that a sari
can be made with this wraparound.

865
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,000
Why are you dancing?

866
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,560
Because you are making me dance.

867
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,720
Gauri. God knows where she has gone.

868
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,160
So many times I told her
not to leave the house.

869
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,480
Still she doesn't heed me.

870
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,080
Aunt, she didn't come here.
- Then where did she go?

871
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,480
She must be inside. She must
be inside. Inside. Inside.

872
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,240
I checked inside. She is not there.

873
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,400
You checked inside.
So, have I hidden her?

874
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,280
Is she hidden here?
Go and check inside.

875
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,240
Fine. I will check inside.
- Go.

876
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,200
Saved.

877
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,800
Bhola has come. Bhola has come.

878
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,080
Bhola, you want food?

879
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,200
Don't you know that
it's 'Ekadashi' today?

880
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,800
It's our fast. I have not cooked.

881
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,160
Fine.

882
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,480
Brother.
- Come.

883
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,640
Brother.
- Yes.

884
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,320
You didn't drive the lorry today.

885
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,800
Look, Bhola. In a week, one day
is an off for me and the lorry.

886
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,520
That's why you are exercising.

887
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,360
Brother, I have heard of water
proof and shock proof watch.

888
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,440
But this is the first time that I
am seeing an exercise proof watch.

889
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,520
Loafer.

890
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,720
Bhola, I had a nice friend.

891
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,800
Friend? Like me?
- Yes.

892
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,120
But he died.
- And I am alive.

893
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,320
Bhola, I like three
things in the world.

894
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,520
My mother.
- Mother?

895
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,200
My mom. Second is my
friend's memento. This watch.

896
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,080
And third one?
- Third is my mind.

897
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:13,320
Bhola, I am a Sardar (Sikh).
My mind is as I am.

898
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,160
Brother, shall I clean your room?

899
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,480
Why? Your sister-in-law
won't come to stay here.

900
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,080
I have come alone.
And I will die alone.

901
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,320
Why do you talk of dying?

902
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,160
First, eat, live and then dye.

903
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,480
I remembered. Brother,
did you have your lunch?

904
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,640
Can't you see?

905
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,720
I have still not taken a bath. I
have not prayed. How can I eat?

906
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,080
You are right. Brother, I
asked whether you had your meal.

907
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,080
But you didn't ask me.

908
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,360
Bhola, did you eat?

909
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,160
Bhola has come. Bhola has come.

910
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,000
You have still not eaten.

911
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,120
Have a banana.

912
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,640
No, Brother. I won't take it.

913
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,240
I will take it only when
somebody gives it to me.

914
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,280
Fine. Fine. I will give it to you.

915
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,800
Here.

916
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,080
You are feeding me for free?

917
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,480
No. I am giving it to you lovingly.
Fruits are sweet.

918
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,880
I don't want sweet fruits.
I want hard earned fruits.

919
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,880
First, give me some
work and then reward.

920
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,400
I remembered. Go bring
the round thing. - What?

921
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,560
The tyre.

922
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,480
So, say that. Here.

923
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,360
Now, what?
- Keep this tyre back there.

924
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,480
Keep it.

925
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,440
You said to give you some work.

926
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,280
You would have done the work.
Here is your fruit.

927
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,880
All of it?
- Yes.

928
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,640
And you?
- God is there for me.

929
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,280
That is fine. But.. -Look.

930
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,080
Leave. If I get angry,
I will slap you.

931
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,240
Greetings.
- Who is it?

932
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,400
Nobody.

933
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,560
Naughty.

934
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,080
Renu.

935
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,280
Banana.
- It's not pumpkin.

936
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,240
Such delicious fruits. I was
wondering what to prepare for lunch.

937
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,400
I will eat bananas. You
have come at the right time.

938
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,560
Renu, listen to me.

939
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,120
Father. Father.
- Renu. Renu.

940
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,360
Father, look. Bhola
has got this for me.

941
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,800
You too eat. Here. Brother.

942
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,640
Brother, such delicious fruits.

943
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,640
If you eat two, you don't have to
eat anything else for breakfast.

944
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,000
Give me four. So that I
don't have to eat lunch too.

945
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,080
Two benefits.
My appetite will be full.

946
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,720
And I won't have to
eat food cooked by you.

947
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:34,880
Here.

948
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,360
Bhola, you are so nice.

949
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,560
These fruits are sweet
like your conversations.

950
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,280
Bhola, do one thing.
- I understood.

951
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,520
I will wash the plate and I
will drink water and go to sleep.

952
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,760
Bhola. Did you read
today's newspaper?

953
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:05,520
Did you hear? In our
city 4424 people starve.

954
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,560
Its wrong, Uncle.
Not 4424. In fact 4425.

955
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,200
Today I too will starve.

956
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I had kept the watch here.
Where did it go?

957
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,160
Where are the silver glasses?
I kept it here.

958
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,120
Brother. Brother.
- Why are you yelling?

959
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,000
Two silver glasses have vanished.

960
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,640
Has there ever been
robbery in this house?

961
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,120
Why are you staring at me?
Two silver glasses.

962
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,560
Oh, God. Why are you yelling?

963
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,560
Its only two glasses. Search
properly. You will find them.

964
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,240
How? Not one, but two glasses.
Silver glasses.

965
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,640
Father. Father. Robbery.

966
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,280
Two silver glasses got
robbed in broad daylight.

967
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,160
Really, dear?
- Yes, Father.

968
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,760
The world is really bad.
- Two glasses.

969
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,520
But dear, which newspaper
has this news appeared in?

970
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,720
I didn't see it in this.
- Oh, my God.

971
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,720
My silver glasses. Where
should I go? Who shall I ask?

972
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,760
Sher Singh. Sher Singh, two
silver glasses got stolen.

973
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,520
Look, robbery was
committed in our house today.

974
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,000
Tomorrow, it could be your house.

975
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,520
Even my watch has been stolen.

976
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,320
Stolen? Then why are you quiet?

977
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,800
Why are you yelling? The
thief is from this shanty.

978
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,320
Then why are you pointing at me?

979
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,320
Will I steal in my house?
- I will nab the thief.

980
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,320
When? Two silver glasses.

981
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,720
Its silver glasses. Do you
know how expensive silver is..

982
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,800
Keep quiet. Harping about
silver glasses. Go inside.

983
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,200
Bhola. Bhola.

984
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,000
Today, you had copied
all the English notes..

985
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,160
..in the classroom, hadn't you?

986
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,640
Copy it for me too.

987
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,400
You don't get up. Get up.

988
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,080
Bhola has vanished.

989
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,880
I don't understand.

990
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,240
No film company accepts my story.

991
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,040
I send it today, and tomorrow,
I get it back.

992
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,880
No problem.

993
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,720
Tomorrow, I will send all my
stories to foreign country.

994
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,000
MGM. Columbia. Paramount.

995
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,720
Sir.
- Paramount has come.

996
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,320
No, sir. Postman.
- Postman.

997
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:29,000
Coming. Postman.
Again a return script.

998
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,000
Look, postman. I am
afraid of only you.

999
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,000
Because you always
bring my scripts back.

1000
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,000
But sir, this time I didn't
bring your story back. - Then?

1001
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,760
I have got a money order for you.
- Money order?

1002
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,360
Yes. Look, Rs.60.
- Wow.

1003
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,000
And in the next month, your story..

1004
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,480
..will be printed in film magazine.

1005
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,000
What are you saying?
- Yes, sir.

1006
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,160
Really?
- Yes.

1007
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,000
Yes. I had written to the
publisher saying if you don't..

1008
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,200
..print this story then I
will send many stories to you.

1009
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,720
Now, they will print it out of fear.

1010
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,720
Yes, sir. Sign here.

1011
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,080
I will have to sign?
- Yes.

1012
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,760
I have never signed. I will sign.

1013
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,080
Hold this.

1014
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,240
Sumitra.
- Sir.

1015
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,360
Leave.
- Sir, take your money.

1016
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,120
It's 60.
- Yes, sir. - Fine? - Yes.

1017
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,280
Sumitra.

1018
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,720
Sumitra.
- What happened?

1019
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,800
Why are you laughing?

1020
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,000
Sumitra, my story is going
to be printed in the magazine.

1021
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,000
Look, 60.. No, I have
received a money order of Rs.50.

1022
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,280
Can't you see that I
am grinding the spices?

1023
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,440
Keep it on the table.

1024
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,880
Chatterjee. Bring the
ink and blank paper.

1025
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,720
And go on writing,
writing and writing.

1026
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,400
Sister-in-law, I
have brought grocery.

1027
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,240
Bhola, I am working.
Keep it on the table.

1028
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,640
Where's Rs.50?

1029
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,000
Just now, Bhola brought the grocery.

1030
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,000
Bhola. Bhola, you
brought the grocery..

1031
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,560
..and kept it on the table, right?

1032
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,880
Yes, Sister-in-law.
What's the matter?

1033
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,760
Rs.50 were kept on
the table. Where is it?

1034
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,880
Sister-in-law, I don't know.

1035
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,760
If you won't know,
then who else will know?

1036
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,880
Besides you, nobody
else comes to our house.

1037
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,040
Brother, I swear. I don't
know who took the money.

1038
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,720
How did it vanish?

1039
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,200
There was a
robbery in our house too.

1040
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,520
Somebody stole my nose ring.

1041
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,640
Everybody is being
robbed in the shanty.

1042
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,440
My two silver glasses got robbed.

1043
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,160
And Anand's gold chain too.

1044
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,720
Oh, my God. That's really bad.

1045
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,800
It means the thief
is not an outsider.

1046
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,720
Yes. But he doesn't
come in our grasp.

1047
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,240
We all knew. But we didn't say.

1048
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,280
But now, we won't keep quiet.

1049
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,800
You came in the house. And
silver glasses disappeared.

1050
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,440
Not one, but two.

1051
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,120
You had come to eat and
you took the gold chain.

1052
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,520
It's futile to sit quiet.

1053
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,720
Will somebody do something?
- Yes.

1054
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,000
Bhola, what are they all saying?

1055
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,240
Uncle, I don't know.

1056
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,000
Where are you going?

1057
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,520
Uncle, you are the eldest here.

1058
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,360
You ask him. Renu's silver glasses.

1059
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,520
Aunt's nose ring.
Anand's gold chain.

1060
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,080
And her Rs.50 kept on the table.

1061
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,080
Where did it all go?
Where did it all go?

1062
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,000
Yes. You forgot brother's watch.

1063
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,280
Great. Even after hearing
everything, he walked away.

1064
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,080
You tell me what does this mean?

1065
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,800
It's futile to talk. He
will answer to only beatings.

1066
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,600
You people search his belonging.

1067
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,400
Maybe he hid things there.
I will frisk him.

1068
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,400
Jeevan. Jeevan, listen to me.

1069
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,000
Shut up. Take out
whatever you have. Come on.

1070
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,560
Mohan, listen to me. - You
frisk him. Listen to me. - Come on.

1071
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,880
Listen to me.
- Found it. Money. - Oh, my God.

1072
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 50. Remember.

1073
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,080
A thief can't hide for long.
Someday, he gets caught.

1074
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,880
Tell me. How did you get this money?

1075
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,120
Just now, you said
that you didn't steal.

1076
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:31,320
Earlier you were blabbering.
Now, what happened?

1077
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,480
Speak up.

1078
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,160
I am telling the truth.
I am not a thief.

1079
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,480
How did you get Rs.50 then?

1080
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,720
It's my hard earned money.

1081
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,320
What did you do? How did you
earn this? Tell me. Speak up.

1082
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,200
I.. No, no.

1083
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,200
Look. How he is staring like an owl.

1084
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,240
He won't speak like this.
Only beatings will do the trick.

1085
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,160
Am I right?
- Don't beat me.

1086
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,280
I kept the money in my
pocket so that I don't lose it.

1087
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:03,400
Chanting God's name and stealing.

1088
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,560
By keeping the money in the pocket,
will it belong to you?

1089
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:09,000
I see. Now, I know where
you disappeared at night.

1090
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,080
So, he didn't sleep here at night.

1091
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,800
He sells the goods
he steals at night.

1092
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,440
And in the morning, he
quietly comes and sleeps.

1093
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,360
No, no. It's not true.

1094
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,720
I earned it to pay
my examination fees.

1095
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,080
Look at his face.

1096
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,080
Sister-in-law, give me my money.
- What money?

1097
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,560
It's my hard earned money.

1098
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,600
No. It's the money you robbed.

1099
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,560
Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.
- Beat him. Beat him.

1100
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,200
No. No. No.
- Stop. Stop.

1101
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,720
Don't beat him. We will take him
to the police station. Come on.

1102
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,400
What commotion is going on?

1103
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:49,080
Brother. Brother.. I am not a thief.

1104
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,640
Who says that you are a thief?
You can't be a thief, Bhola.

1105
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,000
Everybody in the shanty
knows that he is the thief.

1106
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,080
Your saying is of no avail.

1107
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,720
Shut up. Talking nonsense.

1108
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,000
If fools call a swan a crow..

1109
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,880
..then will it become a crow?

1110
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Is he your relative?
- What?

1111
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,000
Only beatings will
reform him. Beat him.

1112
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:14,280
Stop. If anybody raises hands
on Bhola, I won't spare him.

1113
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,480
Leave.

1114
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:19,280
Why should we leave? - You
won't leave? I will deal with you.

1115
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,640
Bhola, don't worry.

1116
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,800
If anybody says
anything to you, just call me.

1117
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,840
I will not spare them. Got it?

1118
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,680
Uncle.

1119
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,800
Uncle.

1120
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,000
Why are you looking at me like this?

1121
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,240
Like others, you too
think that I am a thief?

1122
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,880
I am telling the truth, Uncle.
I am not a thief.

1123
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
The money found in my
pocket was my hard earned money.

1124
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,560
Believe me, Uncle.

1125
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,080
Bhola, you think I will
believe your justification.

1126
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,400
You didn't steal the money?
- Uncle.

1127
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,000
When everybody said that nose-ring,
silver glasses..

1128
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,160
..and other things was
robbed then what did you say?

1129
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,240
Uncle, I said that you
forget to include brother's watch.

1130
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,760
Exactly, Bhola.

1131
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,000
If you had committed the robbery..

1132
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,200
..then you would have never
reminded them of the watch.

1133
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,560
Such innocent words would
never been uttered by a sinner.

1134
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,560
Bhola, never.

1135
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,360
Father, I don't care for others.

1136
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,560
But you don't think I am a thief,
this is enough for me.

1137
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,880
I couldn't tell
everybody how I earned Rs.50.

1138
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,760
But I won't hide anything from you.

1139
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,320
I will tell you everything.

1140
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,880
"I don't know your name."

1141
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,320
"You don't know my name."

1142
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,880
"How can I give my
heart to a stranger?"

1143
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,880
"How can I give my
heart to a stranger?"

1144
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,640
"Yes, no. Yes, no. I don't know."

1145
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:43,640
"I don't know your name."

1146
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:16,640
"On a moonlit night, we will meet."

1147
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,120
"We will talk about us."

1148
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,200
"If I know you
then I might say yes."

1149
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,400
"I don't know."

1150
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:32,160
"I don't know your name."

1151
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,160
"You don't know my name."

1152
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,080
"How can I give my
heart to a stranger?"

1153
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:44,160
"How can I give my
heart to a stranger?"

1154
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,800
"Yes, no. Yes, no. I don't know."

1155
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,760
"I don't know your name."

1156
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,560
"Who knows that
after holding my hand.."

1157
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,520
"You will leave me,
breaking my heart."

1158
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,520
"You will break my
heart and hurt me."

1159
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,120
"Who knows that
after holding my hand.."

1160
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:56,000
"You will leave me,
breaking my heart."

1161
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,400
"You will break my
heart and hurt me."

1162
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:06,720
"I don't believe in your love."

1163
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,480
"I don't know your name."

1164
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,440
"You don't know my name."

1165
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,200
"How can I give my
heart to a stranger?"

1166
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,800
"Yes, no. Yes, no. I don't know."

1167
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,800
"I don't know your name."

1168
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
"You don't know my name."

1169
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,560
Stop..
- No one will move.

1170
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,280
You all are arrested.

1171
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:45,200
To pay my exam fees, I
would work at that dirty hotel.

1172
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,560
I would get Rs.5 daily.

1173
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,720
But I didn't know.

1174
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,120
That not only the
destination has to be sacred..

1175
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,000
In fact, the way to
reach that destination..

1176
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,480
..should be sacred too.

1177
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,560
I received the punishment of my sin.

1178
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,360
I had to spend one night
at the police station.

1179
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:04,280
But on the second day,
when the police came to know..

1180
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,360
..that I have no
relation with that group.

1181
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,760
..they released me.

1182
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,240
Father, now you only tell me.

1183
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,720
How would I have said all
these things in front of them?

1184
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,520
Anyway, they already
see me with hatred.

1185
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,440
If they came know..

1186
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,480
..that I have spent one
night at the police station..

1187
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,160
..they would have kicked
my out of this locality.

1188
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,600
Then where would I have gone?

1189
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,400
Bhola, forget the old
things like a dreadful dream.

1190
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,360
Even I'll forget everything.

1191
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:35,000
Oh, yes, Bhola. You need
Rs.50 for fees. Right? - Yes.

1192
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:36,880
Take it from me tomorrow.

1193
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,160
Oh, Father.

1194
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,320
Go. Go, my dear, go.

1195
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:50,400
"Come on, my songs are calling you."

1196
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:55,720
"My songs. Oh, my beloved."

1197
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,600
"Oh, my beloved."

1198
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:04,080
"Come on, my songs are calling you."

1199
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,720
Who is it?
- Gauri.

1200
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,120
Why did you call me here?

1201
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,080
Please sit.
- No. I won't sit.

1202
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,360
All right. Shall we talk something?

1203
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,040
Ms. Gauri, I am feeling scared.

1204
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,440
And you?
- No.

1205
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,160
It's useless to sit
silently this way.

1206
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,440
Oh, yes. But what
should I say after all?

1207
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,560
Anything.
- Anything?

1208
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,880
Yes.

1209
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,480
So, tell me how is life?

1210
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,080
Are you all right?

1211
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,560
Are these any talks?

1212
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,720
Then is this mourning?

1213
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,800
Bhola, listen, until
you won't speak to me..

1214
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,000
..I won't go.

1215
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,880
Now, what should I say?

1216
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:53,120
Oh, yes. You know Mogul
King Akbar, right? - Yes.

1217
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,720
What yes? Say that he is there.

1218
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,080
Hey, dear, he was there.

1219
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,640
At his time, Mogul
Kingdom progressed a lot.

1220
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
He was very successful in
bringing good thoughts..

1221
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,200
..and a change in the
hearts of the people.

1222
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,720
Do you know that?

1223
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,440
This is wrong.
- This is wrong?

1224
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,200
Hey, all this is written in History.

1225
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,640
If you want then you can read it.

1226
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,480
No, Bhola, I am not telling that.

1227
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,480
I am saying it's wrong
that you call me so formally.

1228
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,040
Then? What should I call you?

1229
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,200
Casually. Even I'll
call you casually.

1230
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,360
You also call me casually.

1231
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,600
All right. If you wish,
I'll call you casually.

1232
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,080
You.. no.. Gauri,
don't you feel sleepy?

1233
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,320
How will I?

1234
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,200
They called you a thief.

1235
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,000
They scolded and thrashed you.

1236
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,760
Gauri, you worry so much about me?

1237
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,600
The bell rang. I am going.

1238
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,560
Bell? - Yes. You know
our grandfather who coughs.

1239
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,760
If he coughs in the morning,
it's 9 o'clock.

1240
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,200
If he coughs in the evening,
think its 6 o'clock.

1241
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,440
If he coughs at night then
think its 11 o'clock. - Yes.

1242
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,720
He is a clock for me.

1243
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,560
I have to feed medicines to him.
- I am going.

1244
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:56,720
Coming, Grandfather.

1245
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,080
Who is it? Oh.

1246
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,400
Mr. Mohan. You?

1247
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,000
What's that?

1248
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,480
This shirt belongs to Mr. Jeevan.

1249
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,880
It's not good to steal, Mr. Mohan.

1250
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,200
Speak softly, Bhola.
Someone might hear.

1251
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,320
Not even a beggar
does such filthy things.

1252
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,280
But I am doing it since long.
- What are you blabbering?

1253
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,000
Its better that I saw
you committing the robbery.

1254
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,160
What if someone else had seen you?

1255
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,000
I didn't just watch.
I have heard too.

1256
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,560
You wretched thief.

1257
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,000
You have committed all the
thefts of this locality.

1258
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,800
To defame me, you came
from Agra till here.

1259
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,080
That too by Punjab mail.

1260
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,200
It's good, Bhola,
that you caught him.

1261
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:14,520
Otherwise, today, I had
been humiliated a lot.

1262
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,000
Please do one more favour, Bhola.

1263
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,880
Never reveal this
rogue's secret to anyone.

1264
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,280
And if necessary, then say..

1265
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,000
You have committed the robbery.

1266
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,000
What are you saying, Mother?

1267
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,560
I can take as many
allegations like a fool.

1268
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,480
But the burden of a
thief's allegation..

1269
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,640
I can't bear to take it at all.

1270
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:39,000
My dear, not me but a mother..

1271
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,640
..is pleading to her son.

1272
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,720
You don't know, Bhola.

1273
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,600
What can't a son do for his mother?
- Mother.

1274
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,000
You call me mother, right?
- Yes.

1275
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,800
Then take this. Before
anyone comes to know..

1276
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,560
..go and throw these shirts
back there. - Mother. Mother.

1277
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,080
Wicked man. You
cheated the one who fed you.

1278
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,640
Look everyone, look.

1279
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,000
Today, my brother Mohan has
caught this thief red-handed.

1280
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,720
My brother Mohan has caught him.

1281
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,360
Come on, speak up.
What will you say now?

1282
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,240
I am not a thief. I
didn't commit the robbery.

1283
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,880
Mother.
- Hey, you thief.

1284
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,080
What is this new matter?

1285
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,000
Yes, yes. These are new shirts.

1286
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,560
Bhola have stolen
these shirts from upstairs.

1287
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,000
Hey? These are my brother's shirts.

1288
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,200
This wretched one cheats
the ones who feed him.

1289
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,560
Father..
- Bhola, did you forget?

1290
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,080
Today, wheat is so expensive.

1291
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,440
Vegetables are so costly.

1292
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,360
Even then I feed you so lovingly.

1293
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,000
Tell the truth,
Bhola. What's the matter?

1294
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,240
Father..
- Bhola, I feed you. Right?

1295
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,880
I am your mother. Right?

1296
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,000
Then tell the truth, dear.
- Tell the truth.

1297
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,800
Your mother is asking you.

1298
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,200
Tell me, Bhola. What's the matter?

1299
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,520
I am your mother, Bhola.

1300
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,520
These shirts.. I have
stolen these shirts.

1301
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,720
Bhola, have you really
stolen these shirts? Yes?

1302
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,160
Yes. I picked them up by mistake.

1303
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,480
This means that
silver glass, gold chain..

1304
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,000
..that nose ring, that cash.

1305
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,160
You have stolen everything?

1306
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,520
You forget to mention
about brother's watch.

1307
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,000
Did you see? Your
darling Bhola has been caught..

1308
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,360
..stealing in our house today.

1309
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,400
You were praising
Bhola a lot that day.

1310
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,000
You were threatening everyone.

1311
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,160
What happened now?
- Why are you dumbstruck?

1312
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:32,080
A thief. Hundred percent, a thief.

1313
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Bhola, I can't
believe in my dreams..

1314
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,160
..that you are a thief.

1315
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,720
Tell me, did you
steal or not? Tell me.

1316
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,880
Say that you didn't
commit the robbery.

1317
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,000
Say that you didn't steal..

1318
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,080
Brother, please forgive me.

1319
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,240
I committed a mistake.

1320
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,720
I committed a mistake.

1321
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,000
So, you committed a mistake
- Yes.

1322
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,080
You thief..

1323
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:05,800
Rogue.

1324
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,040
I was so proud of you.

1325
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I would walk with pride.

1326
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,560
And today? Today,
you have humiliated me.

1327
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:22,000
You fool. Shame on you.

1328
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,880
Sher Singh, this is
an incomplete issue.

1329
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,240
I will complete it.

1330
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,320
I will teach him a lesson.

1331
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,360
Forget it, Mr. Manohar Lal.

1332
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,680
What if anything goes wrong?

1333
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,320
Nothing will go wrong.

1334
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,560
I will make everything fine.

1335
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,120
I have controlled it for many days.

1336
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,880
Gauri's mother,
first, you fed him. - Yes.

1337
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,080
You fed him expensive vegetables.

1338
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,520
Even then he stole the shirts.

1339
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,320
You rogue, fool, cheat.

1340
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,160
Hey? Brother-in-law.
Brother-in-law, what are you doing?

1341
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:57,480
Sister. Sister. Please save me.
- Save me, Sister.

1342
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,640
Brother-in-law.
Brother-in-law, what are you doing?

1343
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,200
What are you doing? - So,
Bhola committed the robbery, right?

1344
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,440
You all still didn't understand

1345
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,760
I will explain to everyone.

1346
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,560
Here is all the stolen stuff.

1347
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,800
And my uncle Mohan has
done this great thing.

1348
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,640
Oh, God. Did Mohan
commit this robbery then?

1349
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,480
He stole all the things and
kept them in his suitcase.

1350
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,120
Here. Your silver glass.
- The second glass?

1351
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,240
Here.
- My nose ring? - It's here.

1352
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,200
And my gold chain?
- Here. - Thank you.

1353
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:27,000
Brother Sher Singh.
Brother Sher Singh.

1354
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,880
Brother Sher Singh.
- Yes?

1355
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,400
Your watch.

1356
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,200
Please take it.

1357
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,080
Now, everyone has got
their stuff. Now, go.

1358
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,320
Why are you all standing here?
- Go from here.

1359
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,240
Oh, yes. Come on,
everyone, go to their houses.

1360
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,440
Mother has become very angry.

1361
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,200
It's my brother's shirt.

1362
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,200
Come on, go inside. Go now.

1363
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:50,160
To defame me, this thief
came from Agra to Mumbai.

1364
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,560
Don't consider this
wretched man as my wife's brother.

1365
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,640
Call the police. Hand
him over to the police.

1366
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,320
Brother-in-law, please forgive me.

1367
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,200
So, I should forgive you?
- Father, please forgive Mr. Mohan.

1368
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,080
Brother Bhola, please forgive me.

1369
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,440
I will never commit
robbery in my life again.

1370
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,800
All right. All right,
first, you get out of the house.

1371
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,000
Get out. Come on, go now.

1372
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:44,520
Oh, yes, Brother. Brother,
I just forgot to tell you.

1373
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,200
Today, I ate food at the
Punjabi hotel, Sher-e-Punjab.

1374
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,440
Chana Bhaturas (Grams
and fried flatbread).

1375
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,600
They were very tasty.

1376
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,280
Brother. Brother, please
tell me how they are prepared.

1377
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:59,000
Bhola, you think by talking
about these things, you'll..

1378
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:04,320
No. No. You didn't eat
food from a Punjabi hotel.

1379
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:07,200
You have been
slapped by a Punjabi man.

1380
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,480
I am very ashamed.

1381
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,000
Hey, listen, I can't face you.

1382
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,720
Don't say that, Brother.

1383
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,800
I don't regret being slapped by you.

1384
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,760
I was scared.. What if
our friendship breaks?

1385
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:25,880
Brother, I can bear
the death of a friend.

1386
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,640
But I can't bear the
death of friendship.

1387
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:33,480
Bhola, the elders
say the right thing.

1388
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,720
Work in haste, repent at leisure.

1389
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,000
The punishment for
my mistake is this.

1390
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:44,000
I misunderstood you
because of this watch.

1391
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,600
I am not worth
wearing that wristwatch.

1392
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Here. Here. You wear
this watch on your wrist.

1393
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,440
No, Brother, no.

1394
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,640
You lose it and I get it.

1395
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,640
This is impossible.
- I say, take it. - No, Brother.

1396
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,800
Take it.
- No.

1397
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,000
All right. If this watch
is not on Bhola's wrist..

1398
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,640
..then this watch will be no more.

1399
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,080
Oh, yes.

1400
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,440
Bhola. - Yes? - Do you
remember what I would always say?

1401
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,280
Three things are very
dear to me in this world.

1402
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,720
Yes, Brother.

1403
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,720
Firstly, your mother.
- Yes.

1404
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,800
Secondly, this watch.
- Oh, yes.

1405
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,560
And third one is your intelligence.

1406
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,000
No. No. Not my intelligence.

1407
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,640
Third one is my Bhola.

1408
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,800
Oh, Brother.
- Oh, yes. My pal.

1409
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,800
What is it?

1410
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,000
Come here. Yes.
Wait. Here. Take this.

1411
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,880
What is this?
- A flower braid.

1412
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,440
You always make a hairdo, right?

1413
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:56,000
So, wear this.
- Why? - I want to see it.

1414
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:00,160
Seeing your beauty, even
moon will feel ashamed.

1415
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,080
And you? - When moon will
feel ashamed.. I will faint.

1416
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:08,000
Then I won't wear it.
- No. I was just joking.

1417
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,520
Please wear it.
- All right.

1418
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,880
Bhola.
- Brother Vivek. Please sit.

1419
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,000
I have heard the
people of this locality..

1420
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,520
..alleged you to be a thief
and gave you a lot of respect.

1421
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,200
Yes, but they took that rank back.

1422
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,440
Shall I tell you one thing?

1423
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,480
The people of this
locality don't know your value.

1424
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,080
Only father has guessed you right.

1425
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,560
That's why he brought
books for me to study.

1426
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,240
I can't understand how
to repay his favour.

1427
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,000
You'll get an opportunity soon.

1428
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:38,880
Father wants you to
marry my sister Shanti.

1429
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,280
My marriage with your father.. No,
I mean with your sister.

1430
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,440
No. What are you saying?

1431
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:45,640
I am telling the
right thing, Brother.

1432
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,080
And father will come
here to talk about marriage.

1433
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:50,800
Father? Oh, no. Why is
father going to come here?

1434
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,640
He should have called me there.
I would have come.

1435
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:55,360
You are getting so uneasy
listening about marriage.

1436
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,080
Be patient, Brother.

1437
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,120
All right. It's time
for father to come.

1438
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,480
I am going.
- All the best.

1439
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,560
Happy marriage.

1440
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,480
Till today, I would think..

1441
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,160
Your professor gives you only books.

1442
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,000
But today, I came to
know he is ready..

1443
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,000
..to give you his daughter too.

1444
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,480
How is the girl?

1445
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,640
When will the marriage take place?

1446
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,640
Gauri, didn't you feel
bad listening to this?

1447
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,800
No.
- Not at all? - No, not at all.

1448
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:28,640
A marriage is good news.

1449
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,000
Everyone feels happy.

1450
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,400
Why should anyone feel bad?

1451
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,000
It's fine if everyone feels happy.

1452
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,000
But can Gauri also feel happy?

1453
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:36,880
Why are you asking me this?

1454
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:42,160
Because.. I.. you..
- Hey? Why are you stammering?

1455
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,000
I thought after
listening that I am..

1456
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,000
..getting married
to some other girl..

1457
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,160
..you will get disheartened.

1458
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:55,000
Hey Bhola, when father-in-law
is coming to see son-in-law..

1459
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,000
..should the
son-in-law be in this attire?

1460
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,000
You should get ready.

1461
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,200
Understood?

1462
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,280
Here. Take this.

1463
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,480
You had given it, right?

1464
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,160
Gauri.
- Bye.

1465
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,560
Gauri.

1466
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Bhola. Bhola.

1467
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,400
Oh, sir. Greetings, sir.

1468
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,000
How are you, Bhola?
- I am fine. I am fine, sir.

1469
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,160
Please come. Come.

1470
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,000
Sir, where will you sit? I don't
have an appropriate place for you..

1471
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,240
Thank you. Thank you, Bhola.
- Sir, I.. Oh, no.

1472
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,720
Sir, what should I bring for you?

1473
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:26,880
Chilled tea or hot Cola?

1474
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,080
Thank you, Bhola.

1475
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,800
Bhola, I always ask about you.
- Yes.

1476
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Listen, Bhola, to progress in life..

1477
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,160
..one needs a good environment.
- Yes.

1478
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,520
Vivek must have told
you everything. - Yes.

1479
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,120
I hope you agree to
marry my daughter.

1480
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:43,240
Yes. No, no. Oh, yes.
What are you saying, sir?

1481
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,360
Sir, instead of coming here,
you should have called me.

1482
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,520
I would have come there.

1483
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,080
Sir, she has arrived. Oh, no.

1484
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,720
What happened, Bhola?
- Gauri. Gauri.

1485
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,000
Gauri is throwing the utensils.
Gauri is throwing the utensils.

1486
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,160
But why?
- I don't know. I

1487
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,000
Bhola. Bhola. If you all
talk about my marriage again..

1488
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,720
..I'll bang everyone's head. I will
break all the utensils. - Gauri.

1489
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,800
Bhola, injustice
with me in my own house.

1490
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,160
Who is he?
- My college professor.

1491
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,520
Greetings, sir. Bhola,
he is a professor and I..

1492
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,040
No, I will ask him.

1493
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,200
Sir, you are a professor.

1494
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,400
And I am a mad girl.

1495
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,000
I have been mad
since the last ten years.

1496
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,880
Every kid of this
locality knows that I am mad.

1497
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,200
Still this Bhola is
ready to marry me.

1498
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,720
Now, you tell me, sir.

1499
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,800
Who will be ready to marry me?

1500
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,640
Bhola will get many girls.
But I have only one Bhola.

1501
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,000
Gauri, shut up. What
are you blabbering?

1502
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,880
Hey, you shut up.
Who is talking to you?

1503
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,160
I am talking to professor.

1504
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:32,800
I am talking about my justice.

1505
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Sir, tell me, did I
say something wrong?

1506
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:38,280
Please tell me, sir. No,
dear. You are absolutely right.

1507
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:40,000
I said the right thing.
You have said I am right.

1508
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,160
Then everything is fine.

1509
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,280
Bhola, its fine.
- Sir, thank you.

1510
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,040
Thank you very, very much.

1511
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,280
Bhola.

1512
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,000
Gauri. What did you do?

1513
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,160
I'm sorry, sir.
- Doesn't matter, dear.

1514
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:57,000
Sir, I with Gauri.. No,
Gauri with me..

1515
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,000
Oh, no, sir. Just
the way you love me.

1516
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,720
Like that I and
Gauri love each other.

1517
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,720
You know my brother, sir.

1518
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,160
He said, "Dear, fall
in love instantly."

1519
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,120
So, even I fell in love instantly.

1520
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,400
This is a result of that.

1521
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,640
That poor girl had
come with untied hair.

1522
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,760
All the people of the
locality consider her mad.

1523
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:17,400
But sir, she is very good.
Don't consider her mad.

1524
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,160
No, Bhola, if I
don't understand this..

1525
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,640
I have no right to
be called a professor.

1526
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,000
Listen, Bhola, with such
smartness and beauty..

1527
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,760
..she gave a hint
that she loves you.

1528
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,000
You don't worry about her.

1529
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,360
I don't worry at all.
- I see. - In fact, I am happy.

1530
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:31,520
I bless you both.
- Oh, yes.

1531
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,000
But Bhola, getting
influenced by these things..

1532
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,800
..don't forget that
your exams are near.

1533
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,000
No, no, sir. How can
I ever forget that?

1534
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,000
Anyway, sir, Gauri helps
me a lot in my studies.

1535
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,120
How?
- Sir, whenever I sit to study..

1536
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,000
Whoever comes to harass me..

1537
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,800
..Gauri throws utensils at them.

1538
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,320
And the one who comes to harass me..

1539
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:52,080
..after being hit by the utensils,
runs away, sir.

1540
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,760
Oh. Even I will flee now then.
- Sir. - Yes?

1541
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,600
Don't tell this to
anyone at college.

1542
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,360
Otherwise, my name will be
scribbled on the college walls.

1543
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,760
Don't worry about it, Bhola.

1544
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,280
Gauri, what have you done?

1545
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,160
It's not right to do
this in front of elders.

1546
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:11,000
What have I done?
- You shouted like an insane.

1547
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,640
Why? Am I not insane?

1548
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,520
I can't understand what
sort of mad girl you are.

1549
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,480
If there had been some
other girl in your place..

1550
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,000
She would have sat in
the kitchen and wept.

1551
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,720
And you had been thinking
how to refuse professor.

1552
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,280
And you would have
married his daughter.

1553
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,560
And I would have lost
you for my lifetime.

1554
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:28,000
Bhola, I am not ready to lose you.

1555
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,720
Understood?
- Oh, yes, understood.

1556
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,880
What did you understand?
- Whatever you explained to me..

1557
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,160
What did I explain to you?

1558
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,600
I am feeling shy.
- Oh.

1559
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,640
"Ascetic. Oh, Ascetic.
What will happen in love?"

1560
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:24,080
"Ascetic. Oh, Ascetic.
What will happen in love?"

1561
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:30,440
"Every day will be pleasant."
- "Really?"

1562
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:35,080
"Every night will be pleasant."

1563
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:42,120
"Ascetic. Oh, Ascetic.
What will happen in love?"

1564
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:48,520
"Ascetic. Oh, Ascetic.
What will happen in love?"

1565
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:54,720
"Every day will be pleasant."

1566
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,760
"Every night will be pleasant."

1567
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,000
"The nights will be long."

1568
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:31,080
"Then the galore of dreams."

1569
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:34,080
"The life will pass now."

1570
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:37,480
"Now, by enjoying and smiling.."

1571
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:40,240
"You make this promise to me."

1572
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,760
"That you won't break the promise."

1573
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:49,440
"Ascetic. Oh, Ascetic.
What will happen in love?"

1574
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:56,000
"Ascetic. Oh, Ascetic.
What will happen in love?"

1575
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:01,840
"Every day will be pleasant."

1576
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:06,880
"Every night will be pleasant."

1577
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,040
"The moon and stars are sleeping."

1578
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,200
"These enchanting
sights are sleeping."

1579
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:35,120
"The magic of night spread."

1580
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:38,400
"Except the two of us,
everyone is asleep."

1581
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,720
"How can we feel sleepy?"

1582
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,880
"We both are forlorn lovers."

1583
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:50,440
"Ascetic. Oh, Ascetic.
What will happen in love?"

1584
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:56,880
"Ascetic. Oh, Ascetic.
What will happen in love?"

1585
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:02,560
"Every day will be pleasant."

1586
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:08,000
"Every night will be pleasant."

1587
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:39,040
"There is an anklet of flowers,
a chandelier of stars."

1588
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:45,280
"In the city of love, oh, beloved."

1589
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,320
"If only we had a house..
No, there is no need."

1590
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:51,800
"You will reside in my heart."

1591
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:57,440
"Ascetic. Oh, Ascetic.
What will happen in love?"

1592
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:03,880
"Ascetic. Oh, Ascetic.
What will happen in love?"

1593
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:10,200
"Every day will be pleasant."
- "Really?"

1594
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:15,320
"Every night will be pleasant."

1595
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:23,240
Brother. Brother. Brother.

1596
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,400
Oh, please come, Bhola.

1597
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,800
Drink tea.
- Oh, Brother.

1598
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,640
Why? Why are you dancing today?

1599
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,560
What's the matter? Brother.
- Yes?

1600
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:32,000
You know that girl Gauri.
- Yes.

1601
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:33,160
She is very good.
- Yes.

1602
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:36,640
She is very smart.
- Yes. - She.. she loves me.

1603
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,240
Really?
- I swear.

1604
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,600
Sure? - 100%.
- Sincerely? - Truthfully.

1605
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:46,000
Brother. - Yes? - Brother, first,
my heart was like an empty box.

1606
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:49,200
But now with the talks of love,
it has become houseful.

1607
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:50,880
Then open the box.

1608
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,360
Tell me whatever you
have in your heart.

1609
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,720
Even I feel the same, Brother.

1610
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,880
But what should I do?

1611
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,280
There is one problem.
- What is the problem?

1612
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,800
Whenever Gauri
comes in front of me..

1613
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,480
I can't utter a word.

1614
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,720
I become dumbstruck.

1615
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,720
You just become dumbstruck, right?

1616
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,880
The pen and paper
are not restricted.

1617
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,000
Write down all the
things to her in a letter.

1618
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,160
What did you say? A letter?
- Yes.

1619
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,320
That means a letter?
- Yes.

1620
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,000
That means a note?
- Yes. - That means a love letter?

1621
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:18,000
Oh, yes, yes. Come on, write it
down. - Oh, Brother, you are great.

1622
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,480
Oh, no.

1623
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:21,200
Naughty boy.

1624
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:32,860
"Come on, my songs are calling you."

1625
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:37,940
"My songs.. oh, my beloved."

1626
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:46,260
"Come on, my songs are calling you."

1627
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:53,100
You sang a song to
call me and I have come.

1628
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:56,020
But what's the need to sing now?

1629
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:59,100
Now, there is a
need to talk frankly.

1630
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:06,580
I.. I truly love you.

1631
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:10,580
Did you see? I can't
express the feelings of my heart.

1632
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:13,500
That's why I wrote
everything on this blank paper.

1633
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:16,100
Read this letter in privacy. Okay?

1634
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:18,780
This is my first love letter.

1635
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:24,260
How did you dare to this?
- Oh, my God.

1636
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,100
I have committed a grave mistake.
Please forgive me.

1637
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:27,940
You deceitful man. - No. No. -
You dare to write me a letter.

1638
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:29,100
That too a love letter?
- No. No.

1639
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:31,020
Just wait. I'll reveal your
truth in front of all right now.

1640
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:32,340
No. No.
- Brother. - Ms. Renu.

1641
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:35,260
Brother. - No, Renu. - Brother Deval.
- Wait. - Brother Deval, Father.

1642
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:38,180
What happened, Renu?
- Look at his courage, Brother.

1643
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:40,580
He writes a love letter
and dares to give it to me.

1644
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:42,700
You fool, you dare to give..

1645
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:45,780
..my sister a love
letter in broad daylight?

1646
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:48,700
Listen, Brother Deval, I gave
a love letter to your sister.

1647
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:51,500
This is my mistake. - Oh,
Jaya, just see what he has done.

1648
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:53,340
Please come here.
- What happened?

1649
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:54,780
This Bhola portrays
himself as innocent.

1650
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:57,020
While he writes a love letter.
- What? - A love letter?

1651
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,180
Yes, Mother.

1652
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:04,020
'My beautiful darling,
delicate bud, my moon.'

1653
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:08,580
'When someone falls in love,
eyes are filled with desires.'

1654
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:10,780
'But why fear when you are in love?'

1655
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:13,860
Goodness me. Writing
all the cinema names.

1656
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:15,700
He has written such a
beautiful love letter.

1657
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:17,700
To hell with cinema.
Read ahead. Read ahead.

1658
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:20,260
Give it to me. Are the love
letters read in front of all?

1659
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:21,420
Let me read please.

1660
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,340
This worthless singer has
never written letters to me.

1661
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:26,420
Let it be. It's a bad
thing to write and read too.

1662
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,940
The worst thing is this.

1663
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:31,180
Where the girls stay, someone
who writes love letter stays..

1664
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:32,700
He should be thrown out immediately.

1665
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:33,940
Today, he has written to her.

1666
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:35,500
Tomorrow, he'll
write to my daughter.

1667
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:37,940
Why? - Oh, yes. - Yes.
- Yes. - Why? - Yes?

1668
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:40,500
I'll give you a tight slap.
- A stray dog bites everyone.

1669
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:42,260
Mother, don't call me a dog.

1670
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:43,420
Why shouldn't she?

1671
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:46,020
A dog only wags its tail
at every house for food.

1672
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:48,260
Oh, yes. The dog lies on the way.

1673
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:49,940
You should be thrashed up.

1674
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:52,100
Yes. Whipped by a hunter.

1675
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:53,700
Just like Dilip Kumar whipped Pran..

1676
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:55,420
..in the movie, 'Ram Aur Shyam.'

1677
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:58,420
Why are you looking to that side?

1678
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:01,580
Dindayal or Ramdayal,
no one can save you.

1679
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:03,780
He considers him as his shield.

1680
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:06,700
Because he always
speaks in his favour.

1681
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:13,260
Come. Please come.

1682
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:20,580
Greetings, Mr. Ram, please go.

1683
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:23,860
So, you arrived to speak in
favour of your disciple Bhola.

1684
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:25,700
The one you consider as your son..

1685
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:27,780
..has written a love letter to me.
- Did you hear that?

1686
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:30,580
What innocence your
innocent Bhola has shown.

1687
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:32,260
Will you still love
this innocent guy?

1688
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:33,420
Tell me.

1689
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:35,780
One should surely love a cow.

1690
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:39,700
But if the same cow ruins the
garden and the surrounding..

1691
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:43,340
..then that cow
should be kicked out.

1692
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:45,780
We said it and now,
even he has said it.

1693
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:47,500
Now, throw out this wretched man.

1694
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:50,100
This evil man shouldn't be
allowed to be here for a minute.

1695
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:52,180
Pick up your luggage.

1696
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:55,580
Get lost from here.
- No, no. Hey, no.

1697
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:58,780
Don't give me such a big punishment.

1698
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:00,580
Silent. You wretched rogue.

1699
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,260
Get lost from here.

1700
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:07,100
All right, Mr. Deval. I am going.

1701
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:15,780
I am leaving this
locality like that orphan.

1702
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:19,700
The one who
doesn't know who he has..

1703
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:21,580
..and where he will go?

1704
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:27,020
But before going, I just
want to say this much.

1705
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:31,420
Father, I have not
done anything wrong.

1706
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:32,780
It's enough. Enough, Bhola.

1707
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:34,500
Now, just go from here.

1708
01:36:35,100 --> 01:36:36,580
All right, Father. All right.

1709
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:39,780
Now, even you are asking
me to go away from here.

1710
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:42,100
I will not stay here, Father.

1711
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:43,940
I will not stay.

1712
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:49,700
Do one thing for me. My
brother is not present here.

1713
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:53,260
When he returns, tell him..

1714
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:57,500
His naughty Bhola has
gone away from here.

1715
01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:01,100
He has gone away forever.

1716
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:39,260
The coughing sound has
stopped all of a sudden.

1717
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:00,780
Grandfather has got
rid of cough forever.

1718
01:38:01,420 --> 01:38:02,500
He is no more.

1719
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:03,860
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1720
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:06,020
How long will the dead
body lie in the house?

1721
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:08,340
A dead body. That too unidentified?

1722
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:11,780
Yes, I mean we should
hand it to some orphan.

1723
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,340
Oh, yes. Call Bhola.

1724
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:17,100
He is an orphan.
- Call him soon.

1725
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:19,180
Go. Go bring Bhola soon. Go.

1726
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:23,940
Bhola. Bhola.

1727
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:27,860
The grandfather who would
cough is no more. - Grandfather.

1728
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:34,420
Bhola, don't commit
this mistake again.

1729
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,580
Oh, yes. We all have forgiven you.

1730
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:39,020
Now, there is no need
to leave this house.

1731
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:42,580
Go inside and look after the work.

1732
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:52,580
'Grandfather, I bid
goodbye to everyone.'

1733
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:54,860
'But I forgot to
bid goodbye to you.'

1734
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:58,940
'And you? You bid goodbye
to all and went forever?'

1735
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:08,180
Father, I have to take
grandfather to cemetery.

1736
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:10,340
Four men are needed to
lead the death procession.

1737
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:21,780
What should I do now?

1738
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:23,700
Everyone has left.

1739
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:26,180
How will grandfather's
funeral rites be performed?

1740
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:28,860
At least, four men are needed
to lead the death procession.

1741
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:32,860
Bhola, grandfather was a poor man.

1742
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:37,180
If he had been rich, all
these would have surrounded him.

1743
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:40,020
To lead his death procession. They
would have fought among themselves.

1744
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:41,700
But don't worry.

1745
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:43,180
You need four men, right?

1746
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:45,100
I am equal to two.

1747
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:46,340
Father is here.

1748
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:48,020
You are here. Come on.

1749
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:49,500
Come.

1750
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:53,940
Father, my exams begin from today.

1751
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:55,100
Give me your blessings.

1752
01:39:56,700 --> 01:40:00,180
Father, I think you
are still angry with me.

1753
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:05,700
Bhola, if a drop of poison
falls in a pot filled with milk..

1754
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:07,700
..it spoils the entire milk.

1755
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:09,780
Father, I won't hide
anything from you.

1756
01:40:10,180 --> 01:40:12,580
I definitely wrote a
love letter, but Father..

1757
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:14,260
There is no need to
give a clarification.

1758
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:19,100
The boys studying in
college concentrate on studies.

1759
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:23,580
A boy who concentrates on love
and affairs is never successful.

1760
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:25,420
I asked forgiveness for my mistake.

1761
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:28,340
Everyone forgave me too..
- Oh, yes, everyone forgave you.

1762
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:31,020
But why? They needed you.

1763
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:34,700
They needed your help to
pick up that orphaned dead body.

1764
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:35,940
That's why they forgave you.

1765
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:39,580
But you can't change
my thoughts so easily.

1766
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:43,700
Father, I am like a son to you.

1767
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:49,780
Bhola, I considered
you more than my son.

1768
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:52,100
That's why I won't forgive you.

1769
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:53,700
Father, I am telling the truth.

1770
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,940
If you won't forgive me..

1771
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,100
What's the use of my staying here?

1772
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:00,260
I will go away from here.

1773
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:02,500
I will go away from this locality.

1774
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:04,780
Whether you go from
this locality or not..

1775
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:09,700
But you go away from here.
- Father, at least listen to me..

1776
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:12,180
I am going to give my exams.

1777
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:14,420
Before giving the first examination,
let me take your blessings.

1778
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:15,700
There is no need for this.

1779
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:17,340
Go take blessings from God.

1780
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:19,700
Don't say that,
Father. Don't say that.

1781
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:22,340
You are my God.

1782
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:24,700
If you won't give
me your blessings..

1783
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:27,340
..I won't be able to
write my exams well.

1784
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:30,500
I am getting late for my exams.
Father, please open the door.

1785
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:32,260
Open the door, Father.

1786
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:38,340
All right, Father.

1787
01:41:38,780 --> 01:41:40,100
Don't open the door.

1788
01:41:40,940 --> 01:41:44,100
But today, I'll definitely fall
at your feet and take blessings.

1789
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:57,420
Father. Father, give me your
blessings. I am your Bhola.

1790
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:00,020
Do you want that I
should fail in my exams?

1791
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:02,500
Father, if you give
me your blessings..

1792
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:05,500
I'll write such papers that
I'll break all the records.

1793
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:09,500
Get up, Bhola.

1794
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:13,420
Get up, my dear. If you
won't write your papers well..

1795
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:14,700
Who else will write them?

1796
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:17,860
Oh, Father.
Father, I had got scared.

1797
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:19,580
That will I get
your blessings or not?

1798
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:25,260
No, Bhola, my
blessings are always with you.

1799
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:27,700
You write such papers,
such papers that..

1800
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:29,700
You just break the pen. Go.

1801
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:31,500
Go soon. You are getting late.

1802
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:33,940
But Bhola.. Bhola..

1803
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:36,420
Always be in my heart.

1804
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:40,780
You always stay here. Father.

1805
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:50,020
Bhola.
- Oh, Father.

1806
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:55,860
Bhola, you have my blessings.

1807
01:42:56,500 --> 01:43:00,260
The disputes which occur in
love don't exist for long.

1808
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:06,180
Oh, Father.
- Bhola. Bhola. Oh, Bhola.

1809
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:11,100
Go Bhola. - Yes. - You are
getting late. Go Bhola. Go.

1810
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:22,780
"Oh, Kanha (Lord Krishna).."

1811
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:31,700
"I will not leave your hand
till we reach across the shore."

1812
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:36,580
"I will not leave your hand
till we reach across the shore."

1813
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:41,420
"I will not leave your side
till the end of the world."

1814
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:46,180
"I will fill your
parting with moon and stars."

1815
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:51,260
"I am that lover who'll turn
stone into wax." - Oh, my God.

1816
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:53,700
"I'll fill love in the
hearts of the ones who hate."

1817
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:55,940
Dear, shut off this noise.

1818
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:57,700
You know I don't like such songs.

1819
01:43:57,780 --> 01:44:00,340
Whether you like it or not.
I am listening to my choice.

1820
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:06,260
"I'll fill love in the
hearts of the ones who hate."

1821
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:07,420
Did you hear that?

1822
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:12,260
Hey, you'll fill hatred in
the heart of your lover too.

1823
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:14,580
Try to understand.

1824
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:16,500
I have to practice singing.

1825
01:44:16,780 --> 01:44:18,500
You are practicing since years.

1826
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:19,940
Did you get any benefit till today?

1827
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:21,700
I didn't benefit, but
I am going to benefit.

1828
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:22,860
Just wait and watch.

1829
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:25,580
How I'll sing and how the
people are flabbergasted.

1830
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:28,340
Malhaar, Maalgaut,
Bahaar (Form of ragas).

1831
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:29,700
I know. I know.

1832
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:31,700
When you sing Maagaut, the sound..

1833
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:34,580
..of the goods train is heard.

1834
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:36,340
When you start singing Bahaar..

1835
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:38,340
The people start going out.
- Shut up.

1836
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:40,260
If people didn't like my singing..

1837
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:41,700
How I had been
offered the programme..

1838
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:43,940
..to sing at Saraswati
Mandal (organisation) tomorrow?

1839
01:44:44,020 --> 01:44:45,780
It's your programme tomorrow?
- Yes.

1840
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:50,780
I am going to get Rs.500 in cash.
Look. Rs.200 in advance.

1841
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:54,020
Oh, God. Let me see
how a 100 rupee note is.

1842
01:44:54,780 --> 01:44:56,580
No. It is fine in my pocket.

1843
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:57,940
Engine of a goods train.

1844
01:44:58,780 --> 01:45:00,260
Now, sit and utter that sound.

1845
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:20,100
"In my opposite flat,
lives a paying guest."

1846
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:26,340
"In my opposite flat,
lives a paying guest."

1847
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:32,580
"I regret my heart is bowled
over by this paying guest."

1848
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:38,940
"In my opposite flat,
lives a paying guest."

1849
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:55,780
"Just don't ask what
sort of wife I have got."

1850
01:45:55,940 --> 01:46:01,780
"Just don't ask what
sort of wife I have got."

1851
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:07,700
"I am left out hungry and thirsty."

1852
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:13,180
"I am left out hungry and thirsty."

1853
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:18,420
"She eats milk and cream."

1854
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:21,260
"Just don't ask what type I.."

1855
01:46:21,580 --> 01:46:24,180
"Just don't ask what type.."

1856
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:30,580
"Just don't ask what
sort of wife I have got."

1857
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:37,180
"This is a false complaint."

1858
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:41,500
"This is a false allegation."

1859
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:45,500
"He is a true husband."

1860
01:46:46,940 --> 01:46:49,780
"In spite of being auctioned.."

1861
01:46:51,180 --> 01:46:59,340
"He signs all property
in his wife's name."

1862
01:46:59,420 --> 01:47:03,580
"The one who borrows
money from his wife.."

1863
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:07,860
"What will he love his wife?"

1864
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:11,700
"The one who borrows
money from his wife.."

1865
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:15,580
"What will he love his wife?"

1866
01:47:22,180 --> 01:47:25,940
"The money makes a jingling sound."

1867
01:47:26,020 --> 01:47:29,700
"The money makes a jingling sound."

1868
01:47:29,780 --> 01:47:32,700
"Everyone dances to its tune."

1869
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:36,420
"Whether married
ones or bachelors.."

1870
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:40,860
"The money makes a jingling sound."

1871
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:42,020
"Jingling, jingling."

1872
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:45,860
"Jingling, jingling."

1873
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:56,100
"Oh, my dream boy,
when will you leave?"

1874
01:47:56,260 --> 01:47:59,700
"When will your music stop,
when will you leave?"

1875
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:03,260
"I won't stop you from leaving.
When will you leave?"

1876
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:07,020
"Go away. Go away."

1877
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:10,780
"Go away. Go away."

1878
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:23,020
"I am walking the deer's gait."

1879
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:27,700
"I am walking the deer's gait."

1880
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:31,500
"Tearing away my shirt."

1881
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:38,020
"Tearing away my shirt, I
have made it my handkerchief."

1882
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:42,340
"I am walking the deer's gait."

1883
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:53,260
"Oh, my darling beloved,
my darling."

1884
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:56,780
"Eat this betel leaf,
please don't get angry."

1885
01:48:56,860 --> 01:49:00,340
"I will never sing a
filmy song again."

1886
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:04,100
"You never yell and
cry like this again."

1887
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:07,580
"I will never sing a
filmy song again."

1888
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:11,260
"You never yell and
cry like this again."

1889
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:14,940
"Oh, my darling beloved,
my darling."

1890
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:18,580
"My Prince, go to sleep,
go to sleep."

1891
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:31,780
Moti, look there, Bhola is going.

1892
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:33,100
It's the last day
of the exams today.

1893
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:36,500
If we allow him to write the
paper today, he'll pass the exams.

1894
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:39,580
I wasn't allowed to copy.
I must do something.

1895
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:41,700
Idea.
- Idea? - Come on.

1896
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:11,700
Bhola, what happened?

1897
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:16,580
Brother. Brother, I
was going to the college.

1898
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:21,340
A few men came to me and
told me not to appear for exams.

1899
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:29,500
I said, "I'll go." Then
they beat me up badly.

1900
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:32,580
Do you know who they were? I'll go
to the police station right now.

1901
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:34,020
No, Brother.

1902
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:39,100
It is important that I go for exams.
Now, only half an hour is left.

1903
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:41,180
But I can't get up.

1904
01:50:41,580 --> 01:50:44,500
Bhola, you will have to write
the answers with your hands.

1905
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:46,420
Not with feet. Come on, get up.

1906
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:50,700
My legs are very badly injured.

1907
01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:53,100
I say, get up.
- Brother. - You shut up.

1908
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:56,940
Get up.
- I can't. - Get up..

1909
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:10,940
Don't worry, Bhola.
You'll appear for the exams.

1910
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:14,500
Definitely. I'll take
you there on my shoulders.

1911
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:16,020
Come on.

1912
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:23,780
Oh, God. We're in trouble.
- What happened?

1913
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:25,700
I had told them that they
should threaten Bhola and..

1914
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:28,420
..terrorise him so that he
would not appear for the exam.

1915
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:30,020
But they have broken his leg.

1916
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:31,500
Oh. What will happen now?

1917
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:34,020
Now, don't talk about
this to anyone. Keep quiet.

1918
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:50,580
Doctor, thanks a lot.

1919
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:52,860
Bhola, come on, let's go.

1920
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:54,500
Come.

1921
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:10,180
Brother.
- Yes.

1922
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:12,420
I completed my paper
with much difficulty.

1923
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:16,340
Don't worry too much. God willing,
you will be successful.

1924
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:23,860
Sit. Wait. I will
be back in a moment.

1925
01:52:58,180 --> 01:53:00,780
Bhola, haven't you
eaten since morning?

1926
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:04,580
Wait.

1927
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:14,780
Bhola is here. I am Bhola here.

1928
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:16,860
Brother.

1929
01:53:20,860 --> 01:53:22,100
I'm Bhola here.

1930
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:27,700
Sher Singh. What is this?

1931
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,940
I came to get food for Bhola.

1932
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:38,780
Take it, Bhola.

1933
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:40,700
Come on, eat it. I didn't remember..

1934
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:43,940
..that you haven't
eaten since morning.

1935
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:46,260
Today, I'll feed you.

1936
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:49,020
Look, the food is hot
and there is a nice aroma.

1937
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,180
Have it.
- No.

1938
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:52,580
I don't like it.

1939
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,780
What is it that you don't like?

1940
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:57,860
Brother, until now, you never
bowed your head before anyone.

1941
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:01,700
But today, for me, you
went to someone else's house..

1942
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:04,180
..and you begged for
food saying Bhola is here.

1943
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:08,020
I'm Bhola here. I don't like it.

1944
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:09,420
What is bad about it?

1945
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:14,940
I don't want my brother to
become the beggar Bhola.

1946
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:16,100
Why not?

1947
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:19,260
Brother, if you say what
I say, it is not proper.

1948
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:22,420
And if I say what you say,
even then it would not be proper.

1949
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,100
Why don't you like it, tell me?

1950
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:26,100
It's not proper. - I say,
you must tell me the reason.

1951
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:27,500
No, Brother.
- Tell me.

1952
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:30,100
You naughty boy.
- What?

1953
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:32,180
So, I had said it
would not be proper.

1954
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:38,180
Naughty boy. - Mr. Jeevan, I
have passed. I have passed.

1955
01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:41,020
Very good, Bhola. - Please
forgive me, but I have passed.

1956
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:42,860
Why do you tell it to them, Bhola?

1957
01:54:43,100 --> 01:54:46,180
They are too tired to look for
their number in the newspaper.

1958
01:54:46,580 --> 01:54:47,700
Uncle.

1959
01:54:47,940 --> 01:54:50,180
Uncle, I have passed.
- You have passed. Good.

1960
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:51,860
Mother, I have passed B.A. exam.

1961
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:53,020
Yes, I heard you.

1962
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:59,180
Gauri. I have passed. I
have passed with first class.

1963
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:00,340
Yes, Gauri.

1964
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:03,580
Uncle. I have passed.

1965
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:06,020
Very good. Bhola, very good.

1966
01:55:06,420 --> 01:55:08,580
Bhola, your hard work has paid off.

1967
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:11,420
Uncle, I could do it
with your blessings.

1968
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:13,020
Oh, Bhola.
- Brother.

1969
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:18,860
Oh, great. Bhola, you
passed with first class?

1970
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:21,260
Yes, Brother. If you hadn't
taken me on your shoulder..

1971
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:25,580
Forget it. With God's blessings,
you have achieved this great success.

1972
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:28,180
Now, I should talk to
you with great respect.

1973
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:32,100
I should not call you Bhola. - Then
how would you address me? As Gola?

1974
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:34,340
Look, now, you
have passed B.A. exam.

1975
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:36,340
While I do not even
know the alphabets.

1976
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:40,700
Now, I should call you, Mr.
Bhola. No, honourable Mr. Bhola.

1977
01:55:40,780 --> 01:55:44,180
Look, I don't like Mr.
Bhola or Mr. Gola.

1978
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:47,940
You must call me just Bhola.
And also naughty boy.

1979
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:49,420
No.
- Won't you say it?

1980
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:52,500
Never. - What if I
made you say naughty boy?

1981
01:55:52,580 --> 01:55:54,260
Are you challenging me?

1982
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:56,100
You are a kid as compared to me.

1983
01:55:56,260 --> 01:56:00,100
For seven lives, I'll call you..
No. I won't say it.

1984
01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:03,500
Forget about seven lives.
I take an oath on God.

1985
01:56:03,580 --> 01:56:06,100
I'll make you call me naughty
boy in this same birth of mine.

1986
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:07,500
I'll see.
- I'll see too.

1987
01:56:07,580 --> 01:56:08,780
I'll see.
- I'll see too.

1988
01:56:08,860 --> 01:56:10,580
I'll see.
- Brother. - Yes.

1989
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:13,100
Please call me a
naughty boy just once.

1990
01:56:13,180 --> 01:56:14,700
No. I won't.

1991
01:56:15,940 --> 01:56:19,100
Bhola. Dear, Bhola.
- Yes, Mother.

1992
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:21,260
I'm very happy that
you've passed the exam.

1993
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:23,780
Actually, it is due to
your blessing, Mother.

1994
01:56:23,860 --> 01:56:27,420
You have passed
because I fed you nice food.

1995
01:56:27,580 --> 01:56:29,860
Now, run and bring
vegetables from the market.

1996
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:31,100
I'll bring it, Mother.

1997
01:56:31,340 --> 01:56:33,940
You go inside, how can you
go when it is so hot outside?

1998
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:37,700
Yes, only Bhola can go
when it is so hot outside.

1999
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:39,700
Brother. Mother, I'll surely go.

2000
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:41,500
But first, I'll go to
the professor's house.

2001
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:42,940
And I'll take his blessings.

2002
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:45,020
First, the vegetable and
only then the blessings.

2003
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:46,700
Oh, Mother, I'll
need just five minutes.

2004
01:56:46,780 --> 01:56:48,340
Thereafter, I'll bring the
vegetable and everything else.

2005
01:56:48,580 --> 01:56:50,700
Why? The moment you
crossed the shore..

2006
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:54,260
..you've forgotten the boat. Have
you forgotten that I gave you food?

2007
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:57,100
As if you gave him
desserts and sweet dishes.

2008
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:58,940
Bhola, you are not
anybody's servant.

2009
01:56:59,020 --> 01:57:00,340
Bhola, go get the vegetable.

2010
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:02,700
Bhola, today you
have passed B.A. exam.

2011
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:04,580
Now, appear like a worthy man.

2012
01:57:05,180 --> 01:57:07,340
Bhola, I say go and bring vegetable.

2013
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:09,020
Bhola, I say go to the professor.

2014
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:12,180
Bhola, bring the vegetable.
- Go to the professor.

2015
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:15,780
He is trying to do some good work,
but you are spoiling him.

2016
01:57:15,860 --> 01:57:17,260
What kind of man you are?

2017
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:19,020
What kind of woman you are?

2018
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:26,420
Hey. Why are you crying?

2019
01:57:27,260 --> 01:57:28,700
As you have seen, these people..

2020
01:57:28,780 --> 01:57:31,500
..won't allow Bhola
even a little rest.

2021
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:34,340
How much more work
can that poor man do?

2022
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:37,500
But why do you bother
so much about Bhola?

2023
01:57:37,780 --> 01:57:40,500
When I look at Bhola,
I feel sorry for him.

2024
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:44,100
When I see him working
so much, I feel very bad.

2025
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:47,580
And Bhola is a good boy. And so
he does everything he is told.

2026
01:57:47,780 --> 01:57:49,700
If there was someone
else in his place..

2027
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:51,580
..he would have put
them to their place.

2028
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:53,700
Brother, the God who created frog..

2029
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:59,420
..why did the same God
create a snake to eat him?

2030
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:01,780
Look, I'm a simple and
straightforward man.

2031
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:03,780
My intelligence is like my nature.

2032
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:07,500
But I'll tell you, the
same God who created a snake..

2033
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:12,420
..created a snake-charmer to
make him dance to his tune.

2034
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:16,860
I knew you would do well.

2035
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:19,860
I'm very happy today,
Bhola. I'm really very happy.

2036
01:58:19,940 --> 01:58:22,860
Daddy, you had seen this same
advertisement for Bhola, right?

2037
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,940
Yes, my son. Good
that you reminded me.

2038
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:28,260
Bhola, send an
application to the address in it.

2039
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:30,700
It's a job of an officer.
You'll definitely get it.

2040
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:32,420
Because you have stood
first in the university.

2041
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:36,420
Sir, I can't forget the help you
extended to me for my lifetime.

2042
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:39,580
Bhola, this is not a
palm of a common man.

2043
01:58:39,940 --> 01:58:42,860
There is a special line on your
hand. Your fate is waiting for you.

2044
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:46,260
You'll be a great man, Bhola.

2045
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:57,340
You.. Do you stay in this tenement?

2046
01:58:57,580 --> 01:58:58,700
Yes, sure.

2047
01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:00,500
Who are you?
- I?

2048
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:01,700
Yes.
- I'll tell you.

2049
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:05,260
A man. Indian. From
Hoshiarpur district.

2050
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:07,020
From village Porwal.
Station Dehlapur.

2051
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:09,180
Grandfather Bhagat Singh,
Father Raj Singh.

2052
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:10,580
And my name is Sher Singh.

2053
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:12,020
Which Singh are you?

2054
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:16,180
I'm not some Singh, I came
from Singapore. - Singapore?

2055
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:21,700
Yes. I heard that there is
an orphan boy staying here.

2056
01:59:22,860 --> 01:59:25,020
Bhola?
- Yes, Bhola.

2057
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:27,700
Yes, yes, Bhola. Where is Bhola?

2058
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:29,260
I came here looking for him.

2059
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:31,020
Tell me, what is your problem?

2060
01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:35,340
What can I say?
Bhola is my son. My son.

2061
01:59:36,860 --> 01:59:39,180
Bhola is your son?

2062
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:42,260
I can't believe it. He is an orphan.

2063
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:46,940
No, not at all. He is not
an orphan. I'm his father.

2064
01:59:47,940 --> 01:59:52,260
When Bhola was six years of age,
I had no means of livelihood.

2065
01:59:52,700 --> 01:59:57,020
I was fed up of my poverty and
I left my young son in Mumbai.

2066
01:59:57,340 --> 01:59:59,500
I went to Singapore to make money.

2067
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:02,020
Now, I've a lot of money.

2068
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:06,940
Such money is useless. Your
son lives like a beggar here.

2069
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:09,500
But the father made lot of money
and enjoyed life in Singapore.

2070
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:10,940
To hell with such a father.

2071
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:13,780
No. Please don't say that.

2072
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:17,020
At that time, the
poverty had made me helpless.

2073
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:20,340
I could not look after
the needs of my son.

2074
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:23,700
But today, I can purchase
many such tenements and..

2075
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:27,180
..transfer them in the
name of my son, Bhola.

2076
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:31,780
But what proof do you have
that you are Bhola's father?

2077
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:33,340
How can you say this?

2078
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:35,700
Can a father not
recognise his own son?

2079
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:39,180
Yes, and there is a black
marking on Bhola's shoulder.

2080
02:00:39,340 --> 02:00:41,580
What you call as a mole.

2081
02:00:41,700 --> 02:00:43,700
Our Bhola has a black
mole on his shoulder.

2082
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:46,260
Yes, it means Bhola is my son.

2083
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:49,180
So, it means my
Bhola is a millionaire.

2084
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:52,260
Not simply a millionaire,
he is a billionaire.

2085
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:53,420
But where is he now?

2086
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:54,780
He has gone to meet the professor.

2087
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:55,940
He will come in the afternoon,
and then you can meet him.

2088
02:00:56,020 --> 02:01:00,500
Yes. I'll go to the bank and
I'll bring a lot of money for him.

2089
02:01:01,180 --> 02:01:04,340
I'm indebted to you people
staying in these tenements.

2090
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:08,340
You people have raised my
young son from his childhood.

2091
02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:10,700
For this, I'll pay Rs.1 lakh..

2092
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:14,500
..to everyone living
in these tenements.

2093
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:19,580
Really. I take an oath on Bhola.

2094
02:01:19,940 --> 02:01:22,180
I'll go to the bank and bring money.

2095
02:01:22,580 --> 02:01:24,700
Bhola is a millionaire now.

2096
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:27,020
No, my Bhola is a billionaire now.

2097
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:34,420
"Listen to a wonderful story."

2098
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:39,340
"There was an orphan boy."

2099
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:44,580
"Today, he is a wealthy man."

2100
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:48,700
"Till recently, he was a pauper."

2101
02:02:09,780 --> 02:02:15,260
"This world is a stage."

2102
02:02:15,340 --> 02:02:17,700
"This world is a stage."

2103
02:02:17,940 --> 02:02:21,020
"Now, he is poor,
now he is wealthy."

2104
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:25,700
"This world is a stage."

2105
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:28,700
"Someone who was hungry yesterday.."

2106
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:31,260
"..is eating desserts today."

2107
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:36,020
"This world is a stage."

2108
02:02:36,180 --> 02:02:39,420
"This world is a stage."

2109
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:08,180
"This stranger world
changes its colour all the time."

2110
02:03:08,260 --> 02:03:10,700
"This world has three names."

2111
02:03:10,780 --> 02:03:13,020
"It keeps on
changing it all the time."

2112
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:15,700
"This world has three names."

2113
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:18,180
"It keeps on
changing it all the time."

2114
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:20,940
"Why should we
bother about such men?"

2115
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:26,180
"Everywhere, the
money is worshipped."

2116
02:03:28,420 --> 02:03:33,700
"Whether it is Patiala or Mumbai."

2117
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:35,500
"Yes, my dear."

2118
02:03:36,180 --> 02:03:38,580
"This world is a stage."

2119
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:41,860
"Now, he is poor,
now, he is wealthy."

2120
02:03:41,940 --> 02:03:46,780
"This world is a stage."

2121
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:49,260
"This world is a stage."

2122
02:04:07,860 --> 02:04:13,100
"Someone asked me
who your relative is?"

2123
02:04:13,180 --> 02:04:15,340
"I laughed and said to him.."

2124
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:18,020
"What can I say?"

2125
02:04:18,100 --> 02:04:20,580
"I laughed and said to him.."

2126
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:23,100
"What can I say?"

2127
02:04:23,180 --> 02:04:25,860
"The one who is rich
doesn't recognise me."

2128
02:04:28,020 --> 02:04:30,940
"The one who is poor, I
do not recognise him."

2129
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:35,700
"The whole world is selfish.."

2130
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:38,340
"..and insane.."

2131
02:04:38,420 --> 02:04:40,180
"This world."

2132
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:43,340
"This world is a stage."

2133
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:46,580
"Now, he is poor,
now, he is wealthy."

2134
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:51,260
"This world is a stage."

2135
02:04:51,340 --> 02:04:53,780
"This world is a stage."

2136
02:05:06,860 --> 02:05:11,860
"My friends would say.."

2137
02:05:11,940 --> 02:05:16,940
"My husband would be a wealthy man."

2138
02:05:17,020 --> 02:05:21,940
"My husband would be a wealthy man."

2139
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:25,940
"Who would be that lucky man?"

2140
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:31,340
"Who will get married to me?"

2141
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:34,580
"I listen to all these talks."

2142
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:37,340
"And I want to tell you.."

2143
02:05:37,420 --> 02:05:42,500
"Listen, this world is a stage."

2144
02:05:42,700 --> 02:05:45,860
"Now, he is poor,
now, he is wealthy."

2145
02:05:47,860 --> 02:05:50,020
"This world is a stage."

2146
02:05:50,180 --> 02:05:53,260
"This world is a stage."

2147
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:55,700
"Someone who was hungry yesterday.."

2148
02:05:55,780 --> 02:05:58,260
"..is eating desserts today."

2149
02:05:58,340 --> 02:06:00,340
"This world is a stage."

2150
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:02,780
"This world is a stage."

2151
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:05,420
"This world is a stage."

2152
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:07,940
"This world is a stage."

2153
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:18,940
Mother, I'm going to the market.

2154
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:20,420
If you want something, tell me.

2155
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:24,020
Oh. How can you go when
it is so hot out there?

2156
02:06:24,180 --> 02:06:26,780
If you want anything,
I'll bring it for you.

2157
02:06:27,020 --> 02:06:30,100
Sit here. Look, I've
brought a briefcase for you.

2158
02:06:30,180 --> 02:06:32,940
Oh, Mother, what use
do I have for this bag?

2159
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:35,940
The things get spoiled
in your old wooden bag.

2160
02:06:36,780 --> 02:06:40,340
Dear, don't feel bad if I,
your mother, scolded you before.

2161
02:06:40,500 --> 02:06:42,700
Mother's anger is actually her love.

2162
02:06:42,940 --> 02:06:44,260
I know it well, Mother.

2163
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:47,700
And listen to me, dear.
Many people talk nicely..

2164
02:06:47,780 --> 02:06:52,580
..but they criticise
you behind your back.

2165
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:55,340
If they get an opportunity,
they will rob you.

2166
02:06:55,500 --> 02:07:01,100
Keep your things inside this
and keep the key safely with you.

2167
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:05,340
But Mother, what if someone
takes away the whole suitcase?

2168
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:10,940
You come up with
some wonderful jokes.

2169
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:16,020
Oh. But remember what I
had told you just now.

2170
02:07:16,180 --> 02:07:19,860
The world is very bad. Don't
fall pray to anyone's sweet talk.

2171
02:07:19,940 --> 02:07:21,780
My dear prince Bhola.

2172
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:24,700
Prince Bhola.

2173
02:07:24,780 --> 02:07:25,940
Where has this tune come from?

2174
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:27,700
Prince.
- Yes.

2175
02:07:27,780 --> 02:07:29,580
Take this alarm watch.

2176
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:31,700
What will I do
with this alarm watch?

2177
02:07:31,820 --> 02:07:34,820
Time is money. Every
moment is precious.

2178
02:07:34,940 --> 02:07:36,700
What?
- Precious.

2179
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:38,700
And so, I and your
sister Jayashree..

2180
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:41,460
..have given this to you as a gift.

2181
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:45,460
What is going on? I'm
getting so many gifts today.

2182
02:07:45,580 --> 02:07:47,220
Whose face did I see
early in the morning today?

2183
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:50,140
Did I look at myself in the mirror?

2184
02:07:51,820 --> 02:07:52,900
What happened?

2185
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:54,420
Well, how do I tell you..

2186
02:07:55,140 --> 02:07:58,140
Nowadays, I don't get
angry at whatever you say.

2187
02:07:58,340 --> 02:08:00,020
I like you so much.

2188
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:01,220
What?

2189
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:03,340
I'll go.

2190
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:12,460
Mr. Bhola.
- Yes.

2191
02:08:13,140 --> 02:08:14,380
Mr. Bhola.
- Yes.

2192
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:18,420
When you read love letters,
your eyes get strained.

2193
02:08:18,540 --> 02:08:21,580
So? - So, I brought
a table lamp for you.

2194
02:08:21,820 --> 02:08:24,980
And look, I even
brought sweet for you.

2195
02:08:25,140 --> 02:08:31,900
I prepared it myself. Your life
will be as sweet as this sweet.

2196
02:08:32,860 --> 02:08:39,580
Mr. Bhola. I was upset to
read your letter last time.

2197
02:08:39,900 --> 02:08:41,460
Please don't feel bad about it.

2198
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:46,220
But nowadays, I read that
letter 20 times everyday. - Really?

2199
02:08:48,940 --> 02:08:51,700
Mr. Bhola, please don't
look at me in this manner.

2200
02:08:51,780 --> 02:08:53,820
What is the matter?
- I feel shy.

2201
02:08:53,940 --> 02:08:55,980
When you see a young man,
you forget everything.

2202
02:08:56,220 --> 02:08:59,300
You saw this young man
and came here to him.

2203
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:00,900
No one is there to look after you.

2204
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:03,460
Bhola.
- Yes, Mother.

2205
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:05,100
I brought a cup of tea for you.

2206
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:08,420
Why have you come here
now?-Shut up. I'm Bhola's friend.

2207
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:11,420
Bhola.
- Uncle.

2208
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:13,420
Look, what I've brought for you.

2209
02:09:13,900 --> 02:09:15,100
A fan.

2210
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:19,260
Switch it on and take good rest.

2211
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:20,460
Take it. Be careful.

2212
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:23,700
It is very heavy. It is very costly.

2213
02:09:26,260 --> 02:09:27,700
Singapore.

2214
02:09:27,780 --> 02:09:28,860
Uncle, what about Singapore?

2215
02:09:28,980 --> 02:09:31,140
Singapore. My dear.

2216
02:09:32,460 --> 02:09:34,220
Bhola, the tea is getting cold.

2217
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:37,500
Drink it.
- Just food is not enough.

2218
02:09:37,580 --> 02:09:39,700
Mr. Bhola is a graduate, but
he has to sleep on the ground.

2219
02:09:39,820 --> 02:09:41,860
Mr. Jeevan, are
you going outstation?

2220
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:44,460
No, Mr. Bhola, I've
brought this quilt for you.

2221
02:09:44,580 --> 02:09:46,460
Oh.
- So that you can sleep in comfort.

2222
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:49,420
But Mr. Bhola, I
gave you this quilt.

2223
02:09:49,580 --> 02:09:51,100
I don't want to publicise it.

2224
02:09:51,580 --> 02:09:53,580
Renu. Have you met Mr. Bhola?

2225
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:56,940
Yes. Renu came and went away.

2226
02:09:57,060 --> 02:09:58,740
Okay. Okay. I'll
take your leave now.

2227
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:00,580
Drink it, my dear.

2228
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:04,020
Bhola. Don't drink the tea.
It's not good for your health.

2229
02:10:04,140 --> 02:10:07,820
Drink Horlicks (energy drink).
Here's the health drink. Horlicks.

2230
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:11,500
And hot water for you.

2231
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:14,460
Whenever you want, mix it
with Horlicks and drink it.

2232
02:10:14,580 --> 02:10:16,580
Sister, why are you
taking the trouble?

2233
02:10:17,140 --> 02:10:18,740
Bhola has drunk healthy tea.

2234
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:23,060
Dear Bhola, you should not
take food from any derelict.

2235
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:26,820
Oh. You call me a derelict.
Are you a queen?

2236
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:28,700
Yes, I'm a queen.
- Bhola, drink this healthy drink.

2237
02:10:28,820 --> 02:10:30,300
Bhola, don't drink it.
- Bhola, drink it.

2238
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:35,140
Bhola don't. - Drink it. - No.
- You must drink it. - No.

2239
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:37,300
Oh.
- Help.

2240
02:10:37,420 --> 02:10:38,500
Bhola can't breathe.

2241
02:10:38,580 --> 02:10:41,700
Bhola can't breathe.
- Bhola can't breathe.

2242
02:10:41,820 --> 02:10:42,900
Give Bhola some water.

2243
02:10:43,020 --> 02:10:46,060
Bhola, have some water. -
Here's the water. - I'm coming, son.

2244
02:10:46,180 --> 02:10:47,860
Water.
- Water.

2245
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:52,700
Wait, I'll give him.
- I'll give him water.

2246
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:55,380
Take from me. - I'll give him water.

2247
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:57,060
Who are you to give water to Bhola?

2248
02:10:57,180 --> 02:10:58,980
Bhola is my son.
- Shut up.

2249
02:10:59,700 --> 02:11:01,580
Don't try to teach me.
- Shut up.

2250
02:11:09,580 --> 02:11:12,340
Why do people fight like animals?

2251
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:17,820
Hey, what are you
doing inside the house?

2252
02:11:17,980 --> 02:11:20,340
Go out and talk to Bhola.

2253
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:24,140
But the other day, you said
you'll break my legs if I went out.

2254
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:27,340
But today, you are asking me
to go out and talk to Bhola.

2255
02:11:27,460 --> 02:11:29,820
You have no sense. You are stupid.

2256
02:11:30,940 --> 02:11:32,020
Am I stupid?

2257
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:33,580
Will you go or not?

2258
02:11:34,020 --> 02:11:35,500
No. Not at all.

2259
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:45,580
Hey, Bhola. You have
become a king from a pauper.

2260
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:46,780
What is the matter?

2261
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:49,140
Brother, I do not
know what the matter is.

2262
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:50,940
I only know that I
have become a millionaire.

2263
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:54,220
Oh. Millionaire?
- Yes. A millionaire.

2264
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:56,940
Brother, take Rs.50.

2265
02:11:57,460 --> 02:11:58,580
What for?

2266
02:11:59,060 --> 02:12:00,700
Brother, now, your
Bhola is no more a pauper..

2267
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:02,820
..but he has become wealthy.

2268
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:05,740
By the way, I have
used your watch a lot.

2269
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:07,180
Thank you for that.

2270
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:09,700
Now, I do not want
this watch for free.

2271
02:12:09,820 --> 02:12:11,060
Hey, you son of a millionaire.

2272
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:13,220
You are weighing a gift
given with love with your money?

2273
02:12:13,380 --> 02:12:15,700
Brother, a person can
buy love, affection..

2274
02:12:15,780 --> 02:12:17,700
..everything with money. Take Rs.50.

2275
02:12:17,820 --> 02:12:19,340
Bhola.
- Keep Rs.50.

2276
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:21,180
You dare to do this. Crook..

2277
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:23,460
You crook. You crook.

2278
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:27,420
Brother, say it. You crook.

2279
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:31,700
Come on, Brother. Say it.
- I won't say it.

2280
02:12:31,900 --> 02:12:33,700
I understood, you
want to make me angry..

2281
02:12:33,780 --> 02:12:35,700
..and you want me
to say crook.. yes..

2282
02:12:35,780 --> 02:12:39,060
You want me to say that. No,
I will not say that.

2283
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:40,940
Brother, just once.
- I will never say it.

2284
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:43,260
Bhola, what is all this?

2285
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:46,020
Brother, I have become lucky.
I have become a millionaire.

2286
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:47,820
I have got all the happiness.
- Great. Great.

2287
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:49,820
But I did not get one thing.
- What is that?

2288
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:53,060
Sleep. Peaceful sleep.

2289
02:12:53,180 --> 02:12:56,140
Oh, Bhola, this is
the miracle of money.

2290
02:12:56,380 --> 02:12:59,060
When you get money,
you lose your peace.

2291
02:12:59,420 --> 02:13:00,500
You lose your sleep.

2292
02:13:00,740 --> 02:13:03,740
But Brother, these
people are very strange.

2293
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:06,180
They start hovering around
you once you have money.

2294
02:13:06,340 --> 02:13:08,780
Just see, what all gifts the people
from the shanty have given me.

2295
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:11,700
It is really surprising. In
one day, all have started..

2296
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:13,580
..respecting you so much. Wow.

2297
02:13:13,740 --> 02:13:16,900
But Brother, you have
not given me anything. Why?

2298
02:13:17,020 --> 02:13:18,500
Has your father given all this?

2299
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:20,780
All these gifts are given by me.

2300
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:22,180
You haven't given me.

2301
02:13:22,300 --> 02:13:23,500
The people from the
shanty have given me.

2302
02:13:23,580 --> 02:13:25,740
That too after seeing the
face of my wealthy father.

2303
02:13:25,860 --> 02:13:27,260
Which wealthy father?

2304
02:13:27,420 --> 02:13:28,500
Brother, even I do not know it.

2305
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:31,380
But I have heard that he
has come from Singapore.

2306
02:13:31,580 --> 02:13:32,780
He is elegantly dressed up.

2307
02:13:32,900 --> 02:13:34,220
He has come from Singapore.

2308
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:36,340
He is elegantly dressed up. Wait.

2309
02:13:39,580 --> 02:13:44,740
Bhola, do you know who is he?
- Who is he?

2310
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:47,020
Your father from Singapore.

2311
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:49,060
What?
- Yes, Bhola.

2312
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:51,700
The people who wear a
suit are not usually..

2313
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:53,740
..the millionaire from Singapore.

2314
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:55,700
He is not your father
but he is my cleaner..

2315
02:13:55,780 --> 02:13:56,860
My cleaner, Jaggu.

2316
02:13:56,940 --> 02:13:59,140
He plays the role of
Majnu's father in dramas.

2317
02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:00,780
I told him to become
Bhola's father one day.

2318
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:03,820
I will see who comes to trouble you.

2319
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:05,060
How did he say it?

2320
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:08,580
Hey, you. Hey, you
people from the shanty.

2321
02:14:08,860 --> 02:14:12,060
Come out of your rooms.

2322
02:14:12,420 --> 02:14:17,140
Look. Your millionaire
from Singapore has arrived.

2323
02:14:17,420 --> 02:14:19,700
The one who was going
to give all of you..

2324
02:14:19,780 --> 02:14:21,420
..Rs.1 lakh each.

2325
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:24,300
Come. Come and take Rs.1 lakh.

2326
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:28,580
Come, Jagya, there are Re.1
notes filled in the truck.

2327
02:14:28,700 --> 02:14:30,340
Come on, Jagya.

2328
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:45,500
Horlicks gives you more strength.

2329
02:14:45,580 --> 02:14:47,940
Horlicks gives you more strength.

2330
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:50,140
Horlicks gives you more strength.

2331
02:14:50,300 --> 02:14:51,380
Horlicks..
- Bhola.

2332
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:53,420
Since the time I have
given you this clock..

2333
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:56,580
..Jaya.. my wife,
she keeps screaming.

2334
02:14:57,740 --> 02:14:59,180
I will throw this clock on her face.

2335
02:14:59,300 --> 02:15:00,700
Throw it on her face.
- Yes, on her face..

2336
02:15:03,060 --> 02:15:05,220
Beware if you ever
write a love letter to me.

2337
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:07,500
And you eat sweet free of cost.

2338
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:17,140
Singapore? Hey, you fraud.

2339
02:15:23,180 --> 02:15:24,580
You are not going anywhere,
are you? - No.

2340
02:15:24,700 --> 02:15:25,980
Then I will take my suitcase away.

2341
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:30,260
Hey, millionaire. Rubbish.

2342
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:35,580
Bhola, I am going out of town.

2343
02:15:37,420 --> 02:15:39,740
I am taking away the Horlicks.

2344
02:15:39,820 --> 02:15:41,940
I am taking away the Horlicks.

2345
02:15:42,020 --> 02:15:43,100
Horlicks.

2346
02:15:47,140 --> 02:15:48,580
Get up.

2347
02:15:57,340 --> 02:15:59,300
Gradually, everything disappeared.

2348
02:16:05,340 --> 02:16:08,420
Oh, Bhola. My dear. Get up.

2349
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:10,580
Tell me, Bhola.

2350
02:16:10,700 --> 02:16:12,020
Where did all these things vanish..

2351
02:16:12,100 --> 02:16:13,180
..the moment I went away?

2352
02:16:13,580 --> 02:16:15,340
They went back where
they had come from.

2353
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:19,420
Don't worry, look what
I have brought for you.

2354
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:20,580
A ticket for Delhi.

2355
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:22,140
Brother, ticket is fine.

2356
02:16:22,940 --> 02:16:24,420
But first, you tell me
why did you play such..

2357
02:16:24,500 --> 02:16:25,580
..a bitter mischief with me?

2358
02:16:25,940 --> 02:16:28,700
Oh, Bhola, not with you.
I played this mischief..

2359
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:30,580
..with the people from this shanty.

2360
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:32,260
My dear, this is my principle.

2361
02:16:32,460 --> 02:16:35,900
To lure a greedy person
and make him do your bidding.

2362
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:38,580
And to fool by falsely praising him.

2363
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:42,060
This is what an intelligent
person has said, understood?

2364
02:16:42,260 --> 02:16:43,700
I don't want to know anything.

2365
02:16:43,820 --> 02:16:45,700
But first, tell me what
was the necessity to..

2366
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:46,940
..play this charade with me?

2367
02:16:47,060 --> 02:16:48,260
I did not plan this charade.

2368
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:49,820
This was planned by Gauri.

2369
02:16:49,900 --> 02:16:51,180
I just supported her.

2370
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:52,940
Gauri?
- Yes, yes, Gauri.

2371
02:17:00,060 --> 02:17:01,140
Gauri.

2372
02:17:10,820 --> 02:17:15,500
Yes. I wanted to make
you a king for a day.

2373
02:17:15,940 --> 02:17:18,260
I wanted everyone to serve you.

2374
02:17:19,140 --> 02:17:20,820
Brother Sher Khan supported me.

2375
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:25,020
I wanted to exact revenge.

2376
02:17:25,100 --> 02:17:26,700
I wanted to exact revenge
against each and every person.

2377
02:17:27,420 --> 02:17:29,940
Today, after seeing
everyone was serving you..

2378
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:33,820
I realised that the
world is made up of fools.

2379
02:17:35,300 --> 02:17:37,700
If I would have known
this earlier then I..

2380
02:17:37,780 --> 02:17:42,140
..I would have never come out
from the mental asylum. Never.

2381
02:17:42,700 --> 02:17:45,780
Gauri, you did the right thing.
Absolutely the right thing.

2382
02:17:49,340 --> 02:17:51,780
Okay, so you have taken revenge.

2383
02:17:52,140 --> 02:17:53,220
What?

2384
02:17:56,500 --> 02:17:59,380
Look how they fooled us?
- Yes.

2385
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:01,060
I will teach her a lesson.

2386
02:18:01,180 --> 02:18:03,020
Aunt. Come out.

2387
02:18:03,140 --> 02:18:04,780
Why are you calling out to aunt?

2388
02:18:04,900 --> 02:18:06,260
She too is deceived.

2389
02:18:06,380 --> 02:18:08,580
You are all the same. Just the same.

2390
02:18:08,940 --> 02:18:11,380
Hey, you. You did all this?

2391
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:13,140
You deceived your mother too?

2392
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:15,300
Tell me. Now why are you quiet?

2393
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:17,420
What answer will she
give you. She is crazy.

2394
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:19,060
Yes, mad.
- Mad.

2395
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:20,260
Absolutely insane.

2396
02:18:20,380 --> 02:18:23,140
Stop this nonsense.
Who is mad? Gauri is mad?

2397
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:24,700
I will say all of you
are mad to think that..

2398
02:18:24,780 --> 02:18:26,820
..I am a son of a millionaire.

2399
02:18:27,060 --> 02:18:28,700
Did anyone of you try
to find out whether..

2400
02:18:28,780 --> 02:18:30,860
..this is true or false?

2401
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:32,700
No. As soon as you
heard millionaire..

2402
02:18:32,780 --> 02:18:35,340
..you all started
hovering around me.

2403
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:39,220
You all started
serving me and buttering me.

2404
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:41,060
Till now, you all
would humiliate me.

2405
02:18:41,180 --> 02:18:44,500
But today, all
started respecting me.

2406
02:18:45,380 --> 02:18:47,940
Now, look at her. 'Madam sweet'.

2407
02:18:48,700 --> 02:18:50,700
All of a sudden, she
started loving me.

2408
02:18:50,820 --> 02:18:52,260
She started feeding me sweets.

2409
02:18:52,580 --> 02:18:55,580
Looking into my eyes, oh,
I am feeling shy.

2410
02:18:55,940 --> 02:18:58,700
And Mother, suddenly
you started feeling..

2411
02:18:58,780 --> 02:19:01,940
..very affectionate towards me.

2412
02:19:02,340 --> 02:19:03,900
And you brother.

2413
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:05,420
You are a very fine man.

2414
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:08,020
You would laugh at
whatever I would say, isn't it?

2415
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:10,940
And you madam, you
would look after my health.

2416
02:19:11,060 --> 02:19:12,340
"Drink Horlicks. Horlicks."

2417
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:15,740
I say not Gauri, but
all of you are mad.

2418
02:19:16,300 --> 02:19:18,380
You all are insane and selfish.

2419
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:20,700
You all have screamed and shouted..

2420
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:22,740
..and called Gauri as mad.

2421
02:19:22,940 --> 02:19:24,700
And Gauri has proved that you
all are mad without saying..

2422
02:19:24,780 --> 02:19:26,460
..anything and keeping silent.

2423
02:19:26,580 --> 02:19:28,140
Now, tell me. Who is mad?

2424
02:19:28,260 --> 02:19:30,260
You all are mad or
Gauri is mad? Tell me.

2425
02:19:32,180 --> 02:19:33,420
Very good, Bhola, very good.

2426
02:19:33,580 --> 02:19:34,700
You are great.

2427
02:19:35,180 --> 02:19:38,460
Bhola, you have shown us
very nicely how crazy we were.

2428
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:42,940
You all are still here? Go. Go.

2429
02:19:50,100 --> 02:19:52,140
Father. Father.

2430
02:19:54,860 --> 02:19:56,740
Jeevan. My dear, what is the matter?

2431
02:19:57,180 --> 02:19:59,740
Father, forget whatever
has happened in the past.

2432
02:20:00,260 --> 02:20:01,500
Actually it was our mistake.

2433
02:20:01,860 --> 02:20:03,300
We used to think that Gauri is mad..

2434
02:20:03,700 --> 02:20:04,940
..but in reality we
turned out to be fools.

2435
02:20:05,580 --> 02:20:08,180
Father, now, I am
ready to marry Gauri.

2436
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:10,740
My dear, whatever you are saying,
is that the truth?

2437
02:20:11,100 --> 02:20:12,300
My dear, say it once again.

2438
02:20:12,420 --> 02:20:15,300
Look here, whatever I say,
I say it only once.

2439
02:20:15,380 --> 02:20:16,460
And I say it very clearly.

2440
02:20:16,580 --> 02:20:17,700
Then my dear, why are
you standing outside?

2441
02:20:17,780 --> 02:20:19,140
Come in and have a cup of tea.

2442
02:20:19,260 --> 02:20:21,820
Forget tea, we will straight
away have the wedding feast.

2443
02:20:21,940 --> 02:20:23,020
You start the wedding preparations.

2444
02:20:23,500 --> 02:20:26,700
But my dear..
- No, no. You should not utter..

2445
02:20:26,780 --> 02:20:28,740
..a single word about dowry.

2446
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:30,180
Okay, Father.

2447
02:20:41,380 --> 02:20:43,700
Bhola. Bhola. My dear,
I have come here to..

2448
02:20:43,780 --> 02:20:45,700
..give you a good news.

2449
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:48,580
Jeevan is ready to marry Gauri now.

2450
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:50,940
Yes my dear, and you
are responsible for that.

2451
02:20:51,140 --> 02:20:53,700
Because you proved in
front of everyone that..

2452
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:57,060
..my Gauri is not insane
but she is absolutely sane.

2453
02:20:57,500 --> 02:20:59,700
My dear, today because of you..

2454
02:20:59,780 --> 02:21:01,220
..Gauri is going
to start a new life.

2455
02:21:01,700 --> 02:21:03,380
She is going to start
a new life, my dear.

2456
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:07,700
Bhola, you are not an
ordinary man for us..

2457
02:21:07,780 --> 02:21:09,220
..but you are a messiah.

2458
02:21:09,460 --> 02:21:10,980
May God bless you, my dear.

2459
02:21:11,260 --> 02:21:12,340
May he always keep you happy.

2460
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:24,940
My dear, did you hear,
Jeevan is ready to marry you.

2461
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:26,180
He came here himself.

2462
02:21:26,340 --> 02:21:27,940
I felt so relieved.

2463
02:21:29,260 --> 02:21:30,460
Why are you laughing?

2464
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:33,260
You felt relieved and I am restless.

2465
02:21:33,380 --> 02:21:34,580
What nonsense are you talking?

2466
02:21:34,740 --> 02:21:37,460
Mother, do not shout. If I
marry I will marry only Bhola.

2467
02:21:37,580 --> 02:21:40,260
What? What did you say?
Say it again?

2468
02:21:40,340 --> 02:21:41,460
I will beat you up.

2469
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:43,060
Mother. What do you want?

2470
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:45,340
Listen. Are you listening?

2471
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:48,100
Are you listening to me?
- Yes, tell me.

2472
02:21:48,220 --> 02:21:51,020
Gauri is creating new problems.
- Problems?

2473
02:21:51,140 --> 02:21:53,780
She says she will marry only Bhola.

2474
02:21:53,860 --> 02:21:54,940
When I tried to
make her understand..

2475
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:56,100
..she took the utensil in her hand.

2476
02:21:56,580 --> 02:21:58,860
No, one way what she
says is also right.

2477
02:21:59,900 --> 02:22:01,380
Why don't we get
her married to Bhola?

2478
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:03,060
Have you too gone crazy?

2479
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:06,580
Can you compare Jeevan with Bhola?

2480
02:22:06,740 --> 02:22:09,140
He has a good job, a good salary.

2481
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:10,940
Why do you want to
reject a good proposal?

2482
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:13,700
Do not worry, I will meet
Bhola and I will tell him..

2483
02:22:13,780 --> 02:22:14,980
..to explain everything to Gauri.

2484
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:16,180
This is right.

2485
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:22,740
"Come, my melodies are
calling out to you."

2486
02:22:23,500 --> 02:22:26,460
"My melodies."

2487
02:22:26,860 --> 02:22:29,140
Till today, I would sing
songs and call out to you.

2488
02:22:29,580 --> 02:22:30,700
But today you.. you..

2489
02:22:31,180 --> 02:22:34,780
Yes, Gauri. Today, I sang
a song to call out to you.

2490
02:22:35,420 --> 02:22:36,820
Because today is a
day to make decisions.

2491
02:22:37,140 --> 02:22:39,220
I too was waiting for this day.

2492
02:22:39,820 --> 02:22:41,140
Today, I am very happy.

2493
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:43,420
I am very happy that you have
decided to come to a decision.

2494
02:22:46,980 --> 02:22:49,260
Gauri, take this, bangles.

2495
02:22:49,460 --> 02:22:53,060
Oh. Bangles. I love bangles a lot.

2496
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:54,740
And this rose flower.

2497
02:22:55,180 --> 02:22:56,820
Which smiles like you.

2498
02:22:57,980 --> 02:22:59,260
I love this too a lot.

2499
02:23:00,380 --> 02:23:02,380
Bhola, you only pin this in my hair.

2500
02:23:03,340 --> 02:23:05,700
What is the matter today? Today,
you have brought..

2501
02:23:05,780 --> 02:23:07,180
..all those things
that I love a lot.

2502
02:23:07,940 --> 02:23:13,180
Gauri. Gauri, I wish that
you look very, very beautiful.

2503
02:23:13,700 --> 02:23:15,700
Why Bhola? Why is that?

2504
02:23:16,100 --> 02:23:19,340
Because it's our last meeting today.

2505
02:23:21,220 --> 02:23:24,700
Gauri, forget me forever.

2506
02:23:25,820 --> 02:23:27,180
You forget our love.

2507
02:23:27,340 --> 02:23:29,180
Bhola. What are you saying?

2508
02:23:29,580 --> 02:23:33,780
Gauri, our love
forcibly brought us together.

2509
02:23:34,580 --> 02:23:37,220
But now.. it is time for separation.

2510
02:23:37,420 --> 02:23:40,140
Separation. How could you say that?

2511
02:23:40,500 --> 02:23:43,900
Because I have a habit
of facing disappointment.

2512
02:23:45,020 --> 02:23:49,140
My dreams get shattered
before they are fulfilled.

2513
02:23:49,340 --> 02:23:50,700
Bhola, I do not like these words..

2514
02:23:50,780 --> 02:23:52,900
..of disappointment and dejection.

2515
02:23:53,020 --> 02:23:56,380
But what your father
thinks that is good.

2516
02:23:57,500 --> 02:24:01,020
Jeevan has a good job.
He earns a good salary.

2517
02:24:01,820 --> 02:24:03,900
He can give you all
the luxuries of life.

2518
02:24:04,700 --> 02:24:05,780
What can I give you?

2519
02:24:06,580 --> 02:24:09,100
For me, it is difficult to
earn even a one time meal.

2520
02:24:09,260 --> 02:24:10,700
Just because my father said..

2521
02:24:10,780 --> 02:24:13,420
..you are talking
to me so ruthlessly?

2522
02:24:13,980 --> 02:24:16,140
Gauri, shall I say something?
- Tell me.

2523
02:24:16,460 --> 02:24:17,700
In the battle between
the good and the bad..

2524
02:24:17,780 --> 02:24:19,940
..the good always
emerges victorious.

2525
02:24:20,300 --> 02:24:23,580
In true and false, the
truth is the winner.

2526
02:24:24,340 --> 02:24:25,700
But in the battle
between love and hunger..

2527
02:24:25,780 --> 02:24:28,340
..the hunger always is victorious.

2528
02:24:29,980 --> 02:24:31,900
The one who has fed me till today.

2529
02:24:32,860 --> 02:24:34,700
If he comes in
front of me and begs..

2530
02:24:34,780 --> 02:24:36,500
..then how can I refuse him?

2531
02:24:37,180 --> 02:24:39,580
It is my duty to
fulfil your father's wishes.

2532
02:24:40,580 --> 02:24:44,340
Gauri, forget me. I beg
of you, please forget me.

2533
02:24:44,500 --> 02:24:45,580
How can I forget you?

2534
02:24:46,100 --> 02:24:51,140
You were the one to save me
from humiliation and disgrace.

2535
02:24:51,700 --> 02:24:55,140
I saved you, that is why I
should desire to marry you?

2536
02:24:55,940 --> 02:24:57,140
How can that be possible?

2537
02:24:57,860 --> 02:25:00,700
A bridge on a river
helps a traveller to..

2538
02:25:00,780 --> 02:25:05,340
..cross on the other side,
but he stays where he is.

2539
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:10,340
He cannot desire to go along with
the traveller on the other side.

2540
02:25:10,580 --> 02:25:12,020
Is this your final decision?

2541
02:25:12,220 --> 02:25:15,580
Yes, Gauri, I am going to
Delhi in search of a job.

2542
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:19,700
You marry Jeevan and
live a happy life.

2543
02:25:20,260 --> 02:25:23,460
Okay, then you too will
have to promise me one thing.

2544
02:25:23,700 --> 02:25:27,700
What? Only that I too
should marry some girl..

2545
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:29,700
..and settle down in life?

2546
02:25:29,860 --> 02:25:33,700
No, Bhola. No. If I am
compelled to forget you..

2547
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:35,260
..even then you do not forget me.

2548
02:25:36,140 --> 02:25:37,700
The place that you have
for me in your heart..

2549
02:25:37,780 --> 02:25:42,220
..no other girl can take
that place. Never, Bhola, never.

2550
02:25:55,980 --> 02:25:57,700
Hey, did you listen?
- What is it?

2551
02:25:58,100 --> 02:25:59,180
Come here.

2552
02:25:59,980 --> 02:26:02,700
Aunt Leela is very smart.
She is quietly getting Gauri..

2553
02:26:02,780 --> 02:26:04,060
..married to Jeevan.

2554
02:26:04,260 --> 02:26:05,940
Look, an invitation card.

2555
02:26:06,060 --> 02:26:07,420
Wedding.
- Yes. - Let it be. Let it be.

2556
02:26:07,740 --> 02:26:09,300
But have you noticed something?
- What?

2557
02:26:09,420 --> 02:26:10,700
For the first time, there is
a wedding in this shanty..

2558
02:26:10,780 --> 02:26:12,940
..and Bhola is not here,
he has gone to Delhi.

2559
02:26:13,380 --> 02:26:14,900
You do not
understand such a small thing?

2560
02:26:15,140 --> 02:26:16,700
Aunt was waiting for
this moment when Bhola..

2561
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:19,580
..goes from here and
she gets Gauri married.

2562
02:26:19,700 --> 02:26:21,340
Really?
- Yes. - But why?

2563
02:26:21,500 --> 02:26:25,100
Looks like there was some
affair between Bhola and Gauri.

2564
02:26:25,260 --> 02:26:26,740
Affair?
- Yes. - Oh, my God.

2565
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:30,140
Hey, talk softly. Whether
there was an affair or not.

2566
02:26:30,220 --> 02:26:31,340
What have we got to do with that?

2567
02:26:31,460 --> 02:26:33,940
I am worried what gift
should we give in this wedding.

2568
02:26:34,340 --> 02:26:39,500
Idea. Like a gift, we will keep
Pappu for a while on their lap.

2569
02:26:39,580 --> 02:26:40,820
That is fine.
- That is done?

2570
02:26:41,020 --> 02:26:43,780
Jaya, I am seriously
worried and you are joking.

2571
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:45,900
Okay, do this..
- Yes, tell me what to do?

2572
02:26:46,220 --> 02:26:49,500
You do not attend the
wedding and do not sing there.

2573
02:26:49,700 --> 02:26:51,500
That will be your biggest present.

2574
02:26:51,580 --> 02:26:52,780
Understood. Understood.

2575
02:26:57,220 --> 02:26:58,300
Bring the bride.

2576
02:26:58,700 --> 02:26:59,780
I will get her immediately.

2577
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:01,700
Jaya.
- What?

2578
02:27:01,780 --> 02:27:05,340
Looking at this ambience,
I remembered our wedding.

2579
02:27:06,100 --> 02:27:09,060
You would look so beautiful then?
- And now?

2580
02:27:09,180 --> 02:27:12,300
Now? Now too you look beautiful.
- Yes.

2581
02:27:12,380 --> 02:27:13,460
Be careful.

2582
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:24,420
Sit down.
- I want some water.

2583
02:27:26,420 --> 02:27:27,780
Someone please get water.

2584
02:27:28,700 --> 02:27:29,780
Quickly.

2585
02:27:35,820 --> 02:27:36,940
Yes, now, sit down.

2586
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:55,860
Groom, get up.

2587
02:27:57,980 --> 02:27:59,180
I say get up.

2588
02:28:01,300 --> 02:28:02,380
What nonsense is this?

2589
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:03,580
Father, what is all this?

2590
02:28:03,740 --> 02:28:05,700
Gauri, my dear, what is all this?

2591
02:28:07,420 --> 02:28:09,820
I want to talk to the groom.

2592
02:28:10,340 --> 02:28:12,700
Why you? That day you
called me crazy and demanded..

2593
02:28:12,780 --> 02:28:14,380
..Rs.15000, isn't it?

2594
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:15,820
But now where am I
demanding any money?

2595
02:28:16,020 --> 02:28:17,140
At that time you
had demanded or not?

2596
02:28:17,500 --> 02:28:18,780
Yes, yes, I had demanded, so what?

2597
02:28:19,340 --> 02:28:21,700
But if you would have
said that this girl is mad..

2598
02:28:21,780 --> 02:28:23,420
..I will not marry you..

2599
02:28:23,820 --> 02:28:25,260
Then I would have
accepted you as a decent man.

2600
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:27,700
But you.. if at that time
we would have given you..

2601
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:30,820
..Rs.15000, you were
ready to marry a mad girl.

2602
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:33,060
You are mad. Mad after money.

2603
02:28:33,260 --> 02:28:35,700
Now, I say that if
you give me Rs.15000..

2604
02:28:35,780 --> 02:28:37,460
..only then will I marry you.

2605
02:28:37,580 --> 02:28:40,260
What did you say? - Tell me, are
you willing to give me Rs.15000?

2606
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:43,140
Great. Tit for tat.

2607
02:28:43,260 --> 02:28:45,740
Dear Gauri, what are you doing?

2608
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:48,580
No one should interfere between us.

2609
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:50,940
Tell me, are you
willing to marry me?

2610
02:28:51,060 --> 02:28:52,580
This is not a wedding,
this is disaster.

2611
02:28:52,860 --> 02:28:53,940
This is my insult.

2612
02:28:54,180 --> 02:28:55,940
I will definitely
avenge my humiliation.

2613
02:28:57,100 --> 02:28:59,420
Father. Why are you
reading the paper?

2614
02:28:59,500 --> 02:29:00,860
Just see what is going on here.

2615
02:29:01,020 --> 02:29:02,780
The wedding is over? Come,
we will go to have food.

2616
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:06,460
Not to eat food, but
we are humiliated.

2617
02:29:06,580 --> 02:29:08,580
What did you say, we are humiliated?

2618
02:29:08,860 --> 02:29:11,740
Mr. Dindayal, I will
file a defamation suit.

2619
02:29:11,860 --> 02:29:16,260
And I will take my revenge.
I will not spare them.

2620
02:29:16,700 --> 02:29:20,940
Mr. Makhan Lal, file a
defamation case later.

2621
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:24,300
First, teach your son and
daughter to speak properly.

2622
02:29:24,420 --> 02:29:27,940
And take what is left
and go away from here.

2623
02:29:28,100 --> 02:29:29,340
Why are all of you standing here?

2624
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:30,500
The marriage is not
going to take place.

2625
02:29:30,580 --> 02:29:31,780
Go.
- Hey, all of you, listen, listen.

2626
02:29:31,860 --> 02:29:33,100
Wait all of you.

2627
02:29:33,700 --> 02:29:36,700
Till today, you must have
only heard the stories of..

2628
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:38,940
..the bravery of Indian girls.

2629
02:29:39,140 --> 02:29:40,860
You must have read them in books.

2630
02:29:41,020 --> 02:29:43,700
But today, see it yourselves..

2631
02:29:43,780 --> 02:29:45,060
Well done, my dear.

2632
02:29:45,180 --> 02:29:46,500
Enough. Enough. That is enough now.

2633
02:29:46,580 --> 02:29:48,260
Come on, Father. And
all of you too go home.

2634
02:29:48,340 --> 02:29:50,860
Yes, yes, all of you
go from here. Come on.

2635
02:29:52,860 --> 02:29:55,460
My dear Gauri, what have you done?

2636
02:29:56,940 --> 02:29:58,260
What have you done?

2637
02:29:59,060 --> 02:30:02,700
Father, why are you
looking at me like this?

2638
02:30:03,220 --> 02:30:06,020
Or are you thinking that
I have again gone crazy?

2639
02:30:06,900 --> 02:30:11,300
No, Father, I am fine.
I am absolutely fine.

2640
02:30:11,740 --> 02:30:13,700
My dear, all that you have done..

2641
02:30:13,780 --> 02:30:15,460
..you have done it in your sanity.

2642
02:30:15,940 --> 02:30:20,420
Yes father, to teach
these greedy people a lesson.

2643
02:30:21,220 --> 02:30:22,700
Isn't it right?
- Yes, my dear.

2644
02:30:23,300 --> 02:30:25,820
I already had a
certificate of being insane.

2645
02:30:26,500 --> 02:30:27,700
By acting like an insane person..

2646
02:30:27,780 --> 02:30:30,220
..I have taught
all of them a lesson.

2647
02:30:30,740 --> 02:30:33,380
I.. Did I make any mistake?

2648
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:35,780
No, my dear. You have
not committed any mistake.

2649
02:30:36,460 --> 02:30:38,140
My dear, you have not
committed any mistake.

2650
02:30:41,340 --> 02:30:44,220
Father, do not beat me.
- What are you doing? Stop this.

2651
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:46,700
You are raising your
hand on your daughter?

2652
02:30:46,980 --> 02:30:48,060
Are you in your senses?

2653
02:30:48,180 --> 02:30:49,580
Sher Singh, I am in my senses.

2654
02:30:49,740 --> 02:30:51,700
But it is better if
a girl like her dies.

2655
02:30:52,220 --> 02:30:54,820
I have suffered so
many difficulties for her.

2656
02:30:55,220 --> 02:30:58,060
She has become a burden for me.

2657
02:30:58,740 --> 02:31:01,340
Just because I am her father,
I am tolerating all this.

2658
02:31:01,460 --> 02:31:04,740
You do not forget what all
our girls have to suffer.

2659
02:31:05,380 --> 02:31:09,780
Whatever sorrows come their way,
they quietly bear it.

2660
02:31:10,100 --> 02:31:11,380
I saw her love.

2661
02:31:11,940 --> 02:31:14,740
She loves her
principles more than her father.

2662
02:31:15,300 --> 02:31:17,700
I am telling you the
truth the day she dies..

2663
02:31:17,780 --> 02:31:19,500
..I will live peacefully.

2664
02:31:19,580 --> 02:31:20,740
You wretched girl.

2665
02:31:21,700 --> 02:31:23,420
Now, I will not allow you
to raise your hand on her.

2666
02:31:24,020 --> 02:31:26,700
If she is a burden for
you then I am willing to..

2667
02:31:26,780 --> 02:31:28,300
..shoulder her burden.

2668
02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:31,220
I will make her tie Rakhi (thread
symbolising brother-sister bond).

2669
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:32,860
I will make her my sister.

2670
02:31:32,980 --> 02:31:34,780
Sher Singh.
- Yes, Manohar Lal.

2671
02:31:35,780 --> 02:31:37,940
Your daughter is very fortunate.

2672
02:31:38,780 --> 02:31:42,060
I will get my sister
married in some wealthy family.

2673
02:31:42,340 --> 02:31:43,420
I will get her
married to some prince.

2674
02:31:44,020 --> 02:31:46,380
You all could not
understand my Bhola.

2675
02:31:46,460 --> 02:31:47,900
You thought he was useless.

2676
02:31:48,060 --> 02:31:49,940
Now, you just watch.
He has gone to Delhi.

2677
02:31:50,020 --> 02:31:51,340
He will return as
a renowned officer.

2678
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:54,980
And now, whatever you say I will
get my sister married to Bhola.

2679
02:31:56,300 --> 02:31:58,700
Sher Singh, till today, we would..

2680
02:31:58,780 --> 02:32:01,820
..bow down in
front of your strength.

2681
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:06,260
And today, we bow down in
front of your intelligence.

2682
02:32:06,500 --> 02:32:08,900
Brother, please do not embarrass me.

2683
02:32:09,180 --> 02:32:10,780
I am a simple human being.

2684
02:32:11,060 --> 02:32:12,780
My intelligence is like me.

2685
02:32:12,940 --> 02:32:14,900
Sher Singh.
- And you do not worry.

2686
02:32:15,020 --> 02:32:17,900
Just watch in what
stately way my boy will return.

2687
02:32:18,940 --> 02:32:20,020
Bhola has come.

2688
02:32:21,100 --> 02:32:22,580
Everyone's Bhola has come.

2689
02:32:22,700 --> 02:32:24,300
Brother, Bhola has come.

2690
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:26,820
Bhola come, you have a
very long life, come.

2691
02:32:29,260 --> 02:32:31,500
Bhola.
- Mother. - My Bhola has come.

2692
02:32:31,580 --> 02:32:33,300
Hey, Bhola, it is you?
- Are you fine?

2693
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:34,700
Just see his personality.

2694
02:32:35,500 --> 02:32:36,860
Father.
- God bless you.

2695
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:39,220
Hey, Bhola.
- Brother.

2696
02:32:39,860 --> 02:32:41,220
My brave lad has returned.

2697
02:32:41,580 --> 02:32:43,940
Oh, Bhola, what is your salary?

2698
02:32:44,060 --> 02:32:45,140
Rs.1000.

2699
02:32:45,260 --> 02:32:46,820
What? Ten hundred rupee notes?

2700
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:48,500
Not for a year but for a month.

2701
02:32:48,580 --> 02:32:50,940
Great. Great. He is a brave lad.

2702
02:32:51,060 --> 02:32:52,700
Bhola, what are you
looking here and there?

2703
02:32:52,860 --> 02:32:55,340
I was looking out for Gauri, it's
Gauri's wedding today, isn't it?

2704
02:32:55,580 --> 02:32:57,100
I have brought a gift for her.

2705
02:32:57,260 --> 02:32:59,100
I will give her this
gift in front of you all.

2706
02:32:59,220 --> 02:33:01,940
Wait. Are you going to give a gift?

2707
02:33:02,580 --> 02:33:03,700
Come, Sister, come.

2708
02:33:05,700 --> 02:33:09,180
Before you give a gift,
I will give you a gift.

2709
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:11,740
Brother, what
happened to Gauri's wedding?

2710
02:33:11,900 --> 02:33:13,460
Like the engagement, the
wedding too is broken.

2711
02:33:13,580 --> 02:33:16,700
What? - Bhola, I want to be
relieved of my responsibility..

2712
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:19,700
..after handing over the
possession to the rightful person.

2713
02:33:19,780 --> 02:33:20,980
Take her, take care of her.

2714
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:24,580
No, Brother. You are
putting me in a dilemma.

2715
02:33:24,940 --> 02:33:26,220
Hey, what dilemma?

2716
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:28,260
There I got married to a girl.

2717
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:29,580
Registered marriage.

2718
02:33:32,260 --> 02:33:36,140
Bhola, you took my advice
to fall in love with her.

2719
02:33:36,500 --> 02:33:37,780
And you fell in love with her.

2720
02:33:38,300 --> 02:33:40,500
And now, you have become a
renowned officer in Delhi.

2721
02:33:40,860 --> 02:33:43,220
After earning so much money,
you forgot your love.

2722
02:33:43,420 --> 02:33:44,500
Shame on you.

2723
02:33:44,700 --> 02:33:47,140
Brother, you are
misunderstanding me.

2724
02:33:47,940 --> 02:33:53,700
Bhola, I had told you that the
place that is created for me..

2725
02:33:53,780 --> 02:33:55,940
..will not be taken
by any other girl.

2726
02:33:56,060 --> 02:33:57,380
I had told you that, isn't it?

2727
02:33:57,500 --> 02:33:59,140
Yes, Gauri, you had told me that.

2728
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:01,300
But you had not told me in this way.

2729
02:34:02,380 --> 02:34:05,580
Listen, Gauri, whatever
had to happen has happened.

2730
02:34:05,900 --> 02:34:07,980
Now, all of you please forgive me.

2731
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:10,700
Mother, please accept
my happiness as yours.

2732
02:34:10,860 --> 02:34:13,780
Father, please bless me and my wife.

2733
02:34:14,260 --> 02:34:15,340
She has come along with me.

2734
02:34:16,340 --> 02:34:17,420
Listen.

2735
02:34:19,500 --> 02:34:21,020
Pushpa, come.

2736
02:34:22,900 --> 02:34:24,700
This is our family.

2737
02:34:25,020 --> 02:34:26,140
Take father's blessings.

2738
02:34:27,420 --> 02:34:29,220
Do not feel shy,
Pushpa. Take his blessings.

2739
02:34:29,700 --> 02:34:31,460
What nonsense is this?
Take his blessings.

2740
02:34:31,900 --> 02:34:33,060
I am Vivek.

2741
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:36,980
Bhola, you are great.

2742
02:34:37,420 --> 02:34:40,940
Your mischief has stunned all of us.

2743
02:34:41,100 --> 02:34:42,500
You rogue.

2744
02:34:42,580 --> 02:34:45,140
Brother, there you said it.
Now, you gave me your blessings.

2745
02:34:45,260 --> 02:34:48,100
To hear the word
'rogue' I did this drama.

2746
02:34:48,220 --> 02:34:51,700
You! - No, no..

2747
02:34:52,340 --> 02:34:54,220
This blessing is for one thing.

2748
02:34:54,300 --> 02:34:55,500
But I will give you
many blessings like these.

2749
02:34:55,580 --> 02:35:00,140
You rogue. You rogue. You rogue.

2750
02:35:00,700 --> 02:35:02,420
Come on, now,
quickly sit on the dais..

2751
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:04,060
..otherwise the
auspicious time will pass away.

2752
02:35:04,180 --> 02:35:06,460
No, Brother, I will not
go on to the dais. - Why?

2753
02:35:06,740 --> 02:35:09,220
If Bhola gets married then
that will be under the staircase..

2754
02:35:09,340 --> 02:35:10,780
Hey. Under the staircase?

2755
02:35:10,940 --> 02:35:12,140
Okay, as you wish.

2756
02:35:12,220 --> 02:35:13,820
What do I care!

2757
02:35:20,420 --> 02:35:23,700
"The alleys are
decorated with golden festoons."

2758
02:35:23,780 --> 02:35:27,500
"The alleys are
decorated with golden festoons."

2759
02:35:27,580 --> 02:35:31,020
"They are decorated with
golden and beautiful garlands."

2760
02:35:31,100 --> 02:35:34,500
"They are decorated with
golden and beautiful garlands."
