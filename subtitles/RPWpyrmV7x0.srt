and it is dub dub DC my friends.

12
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:25,590
Which is apparently like
what the cool kids call it.

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,423
I don't know.

14
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:28,070
- What's up guys, Saf here on SuperSaf TV

15
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,750
and we've just finished WWDC which was

16
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,780
crazy packed with lots and lots of stuff.

17
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,600
Lets go and find out what the reactions

18
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,770
from some of my friends have been.

19
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,299
- Man that was a lot, that
was a lot of, of a lot of

20
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:40,190
announcements in a short amount of,

21
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,290
not even a short amount
of time, it was two hours.

22
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,211
- It was rapid fire, like
every single time like

23
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,380
a new screen popped up it would disappear

24
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,430
in like two seconds
because they would have

25
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,650
so much information that was
just happening so quickly.

26
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,030
- Dub, dub, dub, dub, dub, dub, dub, dub.

27
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,170
- Well you know, "dub
dub" is a software show,

28
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,050
but I was always excited,
its always exciting

29
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,153
when there hardware and we got that today.

30
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:03,334
I mean after how many years?

31
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:04,930
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
six years of waiting!?

32
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,460
We now have a new, Mac pro so that's

33
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,870
pretty exciting, for creators especially.

34
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,500
- Okay not gonna lie, when I first saw it,

35
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,660
it looked like a cheese grader.

36
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,450
I was like, is this a
new kitchen appliance?

37
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,240
But the power behind the Mac Pro

38
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,870
is absolutely incredible.

39
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,300
- Everything man, but I
liked the Mac Pro of course.

40
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,730
Like being the hardware guy,
that's the one that excites me.

41
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,887
- That Mac Pro, mmm mmmm.

42
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,409
- And you, made a little Instagram video.

43
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:30,900
It was like: "do you think
their gonna show the Mac Pro?"

44
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,370
I was like of course not.

45
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,270
Well they did and it is
absolutely fantastic.

46
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,410
I am so excited to spec this thing out

47
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,667
because I feel it'll probably be like

48
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:43,530
$75,000 like by the time
you spec that thing out.

49
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,002
Maybe even more because if you
wanna get multiple monitors.

50
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:47,830
I don't even know, oh my gosh.

51
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,040
Am I gonna be doing an unboxing of

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,290
a hundred thousand dollar Mac Pro?

53
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,920
- Has everybody been
talking about the Mac Pro?

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,120
- Mac Pro modularity
we've been asking for this

55
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,750
for ages, and now we have a computer

56
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,880
which basically we can keep
for lets say 5, 6, 7, 8 years

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,800
without worry of having to
throw away and buy a new one.

58
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,100
- But like that Mac Pro
looked really dope, right.

59
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,760
And what I really appreciate
is that they actually

60
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,110
gone sort of above and beyond

61
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,880
to make sure this is super modulate.

62
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,500
So its not one of those things
where, oh you have to buy

63
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,160
like the Apple adding parts all the time.

64
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,040
Or anything like that.

65
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,240
Obviously the offer
though is a nice sort of

66
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,453
as a feature to have, but you could

67
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:20,680
also just buy your own
graphics card and throw it in.

68
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,680
As long as you have the
drivers, it should work.

69
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,470
And so I was able to take
a look on the inside.

70
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,670
The cooling seems to be solid,

71
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,310
its got a huge power supply, but

72
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,152
importantly you just got a
bunch of PCI slots, right.

73
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:30,540
Put whatever you want in there.

74
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,700
And it even seems like that zion,

75
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,630
even though I wasn't able to
actually take off heat sinc,

76
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,740
is also fairly user upgradable.

77
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,140
So its one of those things where its like,

78
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,972
imagine if Apple makes a
super high end desk top

79
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:42,932
with all the features of
a super high end desk top,

80
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:46,570
and the price of a
super high end desk top.

81
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,670
- Oh my gosh, there's so much stuff,

82
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,100
like just where do we even, watch OS

83
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,200
I mean the IOS, oh gosh
I'm just, new maps.

84
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,990
The new maps looked actually amazing.

85
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,683
Oh, and also Siri, she has new voice.

86
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:02,438
- The photo and video editing on IOS 13

87
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:04,810
was really cool, because
I feel like for me

88
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,240
that will replace that
extra step that I do

89
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,122
in visco for videos at least, like

90
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,480
Instagram videos you know
like editing on there,

91
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,669
but straight on the
camera app is really cool.

92
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:14,510
- Think that I've been
looking forward to the most

93
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,790
of course is dark mode.

94
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,530
I'm a simple man, I just
want to save my battery life.

95
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,090
- Actually, I lied my first highlight

96
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,371
is gonna be dark mode IOS.

97
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:23,200
That's what we wanted,
I feel like we've been

98
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,840
wanting this for the longest
time and its finally here.

99
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,460
- Dark mode, hello?

100
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,094
- The dark mode like we were expecting

101
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:30,841
that more to come and its happened.

102
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:34,310
Also the new watch faces
of course and the new maps.

103
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,330
So like a few things.

104
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,910
- Well obviously dark
mode, like its a favorite.

105
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,030
I was waiting for it
for the longest time so

106
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,550
I use dark mode on twitter, on my Mac Book

107
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,400
on everything so definitely dark mode.

108
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,470
- Yo dude, this is
actually, there was a lot of

109
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,810
stuff here, right so its cool to see like

110
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,620
watch OS updates, I'm actually like

111
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,840
low-key excited to see all the iPad stuff.

112
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,940
Like, for me the iPad Pro is
so close to being a machine

113
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,980
which can really be like a
good for almost everything

114
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,640
besides editing sort of thing.

115
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,047
Like its super lightweight,
I love the software

116
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:03,820
I love the hardware, its just nice

117
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,510
its actually getting
some more Pro features.

118
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,310
- So I'm a big fan of
the iPad Pro, last year.

119
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,410
And that's really like the tablet getting

120
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,132
closer to the laptop and you know

121
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:18,510
Apple has tried to keep
those two worlds separate,

122
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,981
but we're seeing over the last two years

123
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:24,389
Mac OS and IOS kind of merge
the two worlds together

124
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,162
and that new iPad OS is
probably a step in the

125
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:31,240
right direction, I'm pretty
excited as an iPad Pro user

126
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,344
because that's really going
to increase my productivity

127
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:37,620
and be able to use that
tool to do more things.

128
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,850
- Oh, Side Car?

129
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,610
The iPad is a second display and also

130
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,280
you can use it as a
tablet, which is amazing

131
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,970
because I love using tablets.

132
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,100
- Obviously the Mac Pro is the

133
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,730
one we're all excited about.

134
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,370
That stand and that
monitor got my attention.

135
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,830
The $5,000 monitor with
an extra $1,000 stand,

136
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,882
I don't know if a lot
of people caught that,

137
00:04:55,882 --> 00:04:59,544
and then there's another
$1,000 for the matte finish.

138
00:04:59,544 --> 00:05:02,010
So that's an exciting
display, but its very pricey.

139
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,690
But its for the pros so
we'll see how that goes.

140
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,710
And then there's a ton
of features in Mac OS

141
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,553
in watch OS, in IOS, in iPad OS.

142
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:11,109
Its all good stuff.

143
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:12,950
- There's so much stuff,
I don't even know.

144
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,000
This made no sense.

145
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,820
- And there we go guys, highlights from

146
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,472
DubDub, its been absolutely
awesome, so much stuff.

147
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:22,430
For me personally, dark
mode, something that I was

148
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,410
definitely looking forward to, you

149
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,840
guys have hear me say
"dark mode all things"

150
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,830
so its great that we now have that.

151
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,260
And also, sidecar, being
able to use your iPad Pro

152
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,610
with the Apple pencil,
that should be really cool.

153
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,680
I know somebody who uses
that Wacom bamboo tablet

154
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,979
so it will be nice to be
able to experience that.

155
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,680
And Mac Pro, I mean that thing is a beast.

156
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,780
I know there's going to be a
lot of cheese grater jokes,

157
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,130
but how powerful it is, is pretty crazy.

158
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,650
And that's it for this video.

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,030
its been too long of a day.

173
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,610
- I don't actually have one, that

174
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,122
sounds dumb, don't use that.

175
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:21,955
I love that you're able to actually...

176
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:22,788
I'm definitely gonna use that

177
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,265
- It's about three kidneys,
is the rough, rough price.

178
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:29,110
The display is cool

179
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,732
- Two of yours one of mine.

180
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:33,293
- I only have two, so I
think I can only give up one.

181
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,200
- We all throw one in

182
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,506
- I'm good, I'm good.

183
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:40,089
(upbeat music)
