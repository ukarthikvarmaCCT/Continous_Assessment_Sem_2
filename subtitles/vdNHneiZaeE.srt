1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,902
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,902 --> 00:00:02,478
Every year on 1st February,

3
00:00:02,478 --> 00:00:06,014
the country's budget is announced 
by the country's finance minister.

4
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:07,573
In which we get to know

5
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:09,257
how much money does the government earn,

6
00:00:09,257 --> 00:00:11,611
how much is spent in different places

7
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,217
for the welfare of the people.

8
00:00:13,217 --> 00:00:15,552
As usual, this year too, on 1st February,

9
00:00:15,552 --> 00:00:17,535
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman

10
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:20,476
presented the Union Budget 2024.

11
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:22,809
But the difference was that this year's budget

12
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:24,031
was an Interim Budget.

13
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:26,405
"I commend the Interim Budget

14
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:28,101
to this August House.

15
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:29,032
Jai Hind!"

16
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:30,730
It is a temporary budget

17
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,872
that will only give estimates for the entire year.

18
00:00:32,872 --> 00:00:34,380
This is because this year

19
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,827
the Lok Sabha elections will take place.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,927
After the elections, once the 
new government is formed,

21
00:00:39,927 --> 00:00:42,760
the full budget will be presented in July.

22
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,978
This is done every time it is an election year,

23
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,355
but this does not mean that

24
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:47,930
the interim budget is not crucial.

25
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,089
This tells us how the government 
will spend money during the next few months.

26
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:55,769
And we will also get to know the overall 
strategy and direction of the government.

27
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:57,688
So, come, let's understand in this video,

28
00:00:57,688 --> 00:01:00,025
what's in this new budget for you,

29
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:01,449
the common people,

30
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:03,598
and the promises made in the previous budgets,

31
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:05,007
as well as the expenses,

32
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:06,771
how much of it was achieved,

33
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:09,038
and what were their results.

34
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:20,171
Similar to the last year,

35
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:22,941
the main focus area of the government in the budget

36
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:25,098
was Capital Expenditure.

37
00:01:25,098 --> 00:01:26,960
In short, it is also called CAPEX.

38
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:31,153
It refers to the money that the 
government spends on long-term assets.

39
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:33,720
Large infrastructure projects in the economy,

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,329
like making roads, railways, ports,

41
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,218
large-scale buildings or bridges.

42
00:01:39,218 --> 00:01:45,359
Last year, the government had already 
increased this expenditure a lot, by 33%,

43
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,333
and allocated ₹10 trillion.

44
00:01:48,632 --> 00:01:49,773
The data shows that

45
00:01:49,773 --> 00:01:53,830
although the government had not 
spent the entire ₹10 trillion last year,

46
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,891
the actual spending was still ₹9.5 trillion.

47
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,533
But this year, it has been increased further by 11.1%

48
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:08,553
the government plans to spend ₹11.11 trillion this year.

49
00:02:08,553 --> 00:02:10,312
The reason behind this is very simple.

50
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:13,399
The government says that if money is spent on these avenues,

51
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,621
then it boosts economic growth

52
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:17,918
and lead to employment creation.

53
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:22,408
People get jobs when such big bridges, 
roads, and ports are built.

54
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:24,917
The Finance Minister said that in the last 4 years,

55
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:27,567
the capital expenditure has increased by 3 times.

56
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:29,522
For railways, specifically

57
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:32,650
₹2.55 trillion have been allocated

58
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,996
and 3 new corridors have been announced.

59
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:36,969
Energy, Mineral, and Cement Corridor,

60
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:38,372
Port Connectivity Corridor,

61
00:02:38,372 --> 00:02:40,034
and High Traffic Density Corridor.

62
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,584
The Finance Minister has also said that

63
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:43,721
more than 40,000 normal rail coaches

64
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:46,345
will be converted to Vande Bharat standards.

65
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:50,372
"Forty thousand normal rail bogies

66
00:02:50,372 --> 00:02:54,990
will be converted to the Vande Bharat standards"

67
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,462
This year's railway's allocation

68
00:02:56,462 --> 00:02:59,421
is much higher than last year's ₹2.41 trillion.

69
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:03,428
While last year, we had already seen an increase of ₹1 trillion.

70
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:04,444
This is good news,

71
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:05,804
but hopefully, its impact

72
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:08,310
will be seen on the ground in railway safety as well.

73
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,899
Because last year, there were many accidents.

74
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,181
On 29th October, the train collision in Andhra Pradesh.

75
00:03:14,181 --> 00:03:17,650
On 11th October, Bihar North East Express derailment.

76
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,816
On 26th September, Mathura EMU train derailment.

77
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,773
And in June 2023, we witnessed the train collision in Odisha,

78
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:27,033
which was one of the most dangerous 
accidents in the history of the nation.

79
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:29,748
Almost 300 people lost their lives in this accident.

80
00:03:29,748 --> 00:03:33,545
"In India, where at least 260 people have been k!lled,

81
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:35,851
in a train crash in the eastern state of Odisha.

82
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:38,818
It's already the country's worst train crash this century."

83
00:03:39,063 --> 00:03:40,837
In the agriculture sector,

84
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:42,072
the goverment has announced

85
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:44,051
Atmanirbhar Oil Seeds Abhiyan 

86
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:46,845
and focused on fertilisers like Nano-DAP. 

87
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:48,838
Nano-DAP stands for

88
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:50,718
Nano Di-Ammonium Phosphate.

89
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:53,054
A type of eco-friendly fertiliser

90
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:56,458
with 8% nitrogen and 16% phosphorous. 

91
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:58,769
This is very useful for Green Farming.

92
00:03:58,769 --> 00:03:59,927
That's why it is being promoted.

93
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:02,674
On the other hand, in the Oil Seeds Initiative

94
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:03,834
the government has said that

95
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:06,620
they want to cut the imports from outside the country.

96
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:11,336
They want to cut down edible oil 
imports from 60% to 30%.

97
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:18,166
So that India can become self-reliant in 
seeds like mustard, groundnut, soybean, sunflower.

98
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,887
But the subsidies that are given for fertilizers

99
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,713
saw a budget cut.

100
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:26,281
In comparison to the ₹1.89 trillion from last year,

101
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:29,061
only ₹1.64 trillion has been allocated this year.

102
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,582
Food subsidies have also been cut.

103
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:34,191
Last year's budget allocation was ₹2.12 trillion.

104
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:38,093
This year it has been reduced to ₹2.05 trillion.

105
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:40,215
In the education and healthcare sectors,

106
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:41,508
we got some bad news.

107
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:44,600
The government had already cut 
the education budget last year.

108
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,669
But the amount that the government 
had promised to spend last year,

109
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,068
they didn't even spent that,
their spending was lower than that.

110
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:55,473
In last year's budget, the government 
promised to spend ₹1.16 trillion on education.

111
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:58,723
But according to the revised budget estimates,

112
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:02,492
the government will be able to spend only ₹1.08 trillion.

113
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:05,545
This year, there is a small increase in the education budget.

114
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:07,783
Instead of ₹1.16 trillion,

115
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:11,172
the government has now allocated ₹1.25 trillion.

116
00:05:11,172 --> 00:05:13,265
On top of that, in the education sector,

117
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:15,843
big budget cuts have been made in many places.

118
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:19,768
For example, the budget allocated to UGC, 
the University Grants Commission,

119
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:22,121
has been cut by 60%.

120
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,919
Last year's revised estimate was ₹64.09 billion.

121
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,289
This year, they were given only ₹25 billion.

122
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:33,161
The budget allocated to IITs and IIMs 
has also been decreased this year.

123
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:36,135
Instead of ₹103.84 billion,

124
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:39,781
₹103.24 billion for IITs.

125
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:42,984
Instead of ₹3 billion for IIMs last year,

126
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:46,041
only ₹2.12 billion have been allocated this year.

127
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,988
But where has this budget increased in education?

128
00:05:48,988 --> 00:05:51,727
More money is being spent on central universities.

129
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,335
Instead of the ₹115 billion last year,

130
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:57,216
₹150 billion have been allocated this year.

131
00:05:57,216 --> 00:05:59,873
The amount spent on research 
and innovation has been increased.

132
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:02,025
Instead of ₹2 billion last year,

133
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:05,718
this year, ₹3.55 billion has been allocated.

134
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:07,631
In the healthcare sector, last year, the government

135
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:10,152
had allocated ₹890 billion.

136
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:12,152
But, according to revised estimates,

137
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:14,872
only ₹790 billion will be spent.

138
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:17,195
This year, a small increase has been seen.

139
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:18,986
Instead of ₹890 billion,

140
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:21,994
the government has allocated ₹900 billion.

141
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:24,000
Here, two initiatives have been 
announced by the government.

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,931
First, the Ayushman Bharat scheme will be expanded

143
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:30,239
and second, they have focused 
on the cervical cancer vaccine too.

144
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:31,777
After this, we come to housing

145
00:06:31,777 --> 00:06:33,904
where the Prime Minister Awas scheme is underway.

146
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:36,211
To give affordable housing to the poor.

147
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:37,762
Its allocation has been increased.

148
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:40,656
Instead of the ₹795.90 billion last year,

149
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:44,880
₹806.71 billion have been allocated this year.

150
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:47,637
Under this scheme, the government has also said that

151
00:06:47,637 --> 00:06:51,897
they will launch a new scheme for 
the deserving sections of the middle class.

152
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:54,219
Those who live in rented houses,

153
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:56,951
slums or unauthorized colonies,

154
00:06:56,951 --> 00:07:00,073
will be given the opportunity to 
build and buy their own houses.

155
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:01,889
If we talk about the overall economy,

156
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:04,009
India's real GDP growth rate,

157
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:06,761
which is projected for 2023-2024,

158
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,357
will be at 7.3%.

159
00:07:09,357 --> 00:07:11,422
There are two types of GDPs, friends.

160
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:14,145
One is the Nominal GDP 
and the other is the Real GDP.

161
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:17,850
Nominal GDP shows the size of the 
economy according to today's prices.

162
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,254
But in real GDP, we take inflation into account.

163
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:25,158
For example, if the nominal GDP 
growth rate of a country is 15%,

164
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:27,893
but the inflation rate in the country is 10%,

165
00:07:27,893 --> 00:07:29,960
then the real GDP growth rate will be

166
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,037
15% - 10% = 5%.

167
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:36,575
But in 2022-23, India's actual Nominal GDP growth rate

168
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,798
is 10.5%.

169
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:41,890
And our inflation is approximately 4% per cent.

170
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,169
So the real GDP growth rate is 6.5%.

171
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:47,516
This is a bit low because

172
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:50,962
in December 2023, RBI had raised its projections

173
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:54,509
and said that India's GDP growth rate would be around 7%.

174
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:58,211
But today, this is near 6.5%.

175
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,533
If we look at the estimates of international 
agencies for India's GDP growth rate,

176
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:03,588
they are in the similar range.

177
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:08,371
In October 2023, the IMF projected 
India's growth rate to be 6.3%.

178
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:13,098
And for 2024-25, World Bank has projected 6.4%,

179
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:16,433
OECD has projected 6.1%,

180
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:19,620
and ADB has projected 6.7%.

181
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,315
IMF has also projected that India

182
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:24,459
will become the third-largest economy by 2027.

183
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,050
It is very interesting to see

184
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,564
how different agencies identify patterns in data

185
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:31,835
and predict the growth of a country.

186
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:34,761
Data scientists are often tasked with this work.

187
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:37,316
And this is the reason why, today data science

188
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,899
is one of the most lucrative career options.

189
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,763
Data and the conclusions from data

190
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:44,929
have a huge impact on different industries.

191
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:47,443
The figures for GDP growth rate are so important that

192
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,763
it can cause the market to go up or crash.

193
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,586
If you are interested in this field

194
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:53,556

00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:42,949
And by attending the live class, 
you can judge for yourself

216
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,716
whether it is suitable for you or not.

217
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:46,234
Now, let's get back to the video.

218
00:09:46,424 --> 00:09:49,507
Next, we come to the second 
biggest focus area of this budget,

219
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:52,599
that is, reducing the fiscal deficit.

220
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:56,432
The Fiscal Deficit is the difference between 
the government's revenue and expenditure.

221
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:58,464
The amount spent by the government

222
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,311
and the revenue it earns,

223
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:01,520
the difference between the two.

224
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,530
And since the word Deficit is being used here,

225
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,594
it means that compared to the revenue of the government,

226
00:10:06,594 --> 00:10:08,715
they are spending more than that.

227
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:11,653
For this year, India's Fiscal Deficit is estimated to be

228
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,334
₹17.86 trillion.

229
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:18,234
But we usually look at the Fiscal Deficit 
as a percentage of GDP.

230
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:20,374
Last year, the government had set a target that

231
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:23,898
it should be 5.9% of GDP this year.

232
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:25,765
And revised estimates show that

233
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:28,121
not only has the government achieved its target

234
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:32,287
but they have brought it down to 5.8%.

235
00:10:32,287 --> 00:10:39,366
In this year's budget, the Fiscal Deficit target 
for 2024-2025 is set at 5.1% of GDP.

236
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:41,128
This is lower than before
which is a good thing.

237
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:44,467
In fact, in 2003, the government had passed an Act,

238
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:47,894
the Fiscal Responsibility 
and Budget Management Act, 2003.

239
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:49,110
According to this Act,

240
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,954
the government's target should be

241
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:54,870
to keep the fiscal deficit at only 3% of nominal GDP.

242
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,295
But since then, there has been only one year,

243
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:00,401
around 2007-08,

244
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:02,867
where the government was able to meet this target.

245
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:04,773
Since the last few years, the government

246
00:11:04,773 --> 00:11:06,636
is slowly reducing it so that

247
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:08,284
it can be brought down to that range.

248
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:10,625
And for the Financial Year 2026,

249
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,298
the target is set at 4.5%.

250
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,371
Whatever money the government earns,

251
00:11:15,371 --> 00:11:17,626
one-third of it

252
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:19,902
is spent on interest servicing.

253
00:11:19,902 --> 00:11:25,326
Interest Servicing refers to the interest payments 
of the loan taken by the government.

254
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:28,277
Both domestic and international 
borrowings are included in this.

255
00:11:28,277 --> 00:11:30,675
Whether the government has borrowed 
money from within the country

256
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:33,175
or from outside the country.

257
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:35,006
In total, this year, the government will

258
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:39,611
spend ₹11.9 trillion on Interest Servicing.

259
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:44,351
This number has increased by ₹1.35 trillion 
in comparison to last year.

260
00:11:44,813 --> 00:11:46,371
In this table, you can see the major expenses

261
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:48,438
of the government based on this year's budget.

262
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:50,467
And it has been compared to

263
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:53,101
the revised budget estimates of last year.

264
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:54,249
If we talk about taxes,

265
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:56,569
there is nothing for the common people in this budget

266
00:11:56,569 --> 00:11:59,578
because nothing has changed 
in comparison to last year.

267
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:01,080
The income tax slabs are still there.

268
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,976
But another interesting thing to see here is that

269
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:06,944
which taxes generate the most revenue for the government?

270
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,379
Budget documents show that in FY 2025,

271
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:13,291
the government will earn 19% of its revenue

272
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,533
from taxes collected under the Income Tax.

273
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,599
On the second number is GST with 18%.

274
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:20,091
The government will earn 18% of its 
revenue from the taxes collected under GST.

275
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:23,407
And then comes the Corporate Tax at 17%.

276
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:26,214
This shows that the biggest 
contribution to the government's revenue

277
00:12:26,214 --> 00:12:27,786
is that of the Income Tax payers.

278
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:29,946
And the GST payers.

279
00:12:29,946 --> 00:12:34,478
And the contribution of the Corporate 
Tax paid by the companies

280
00:12:34,478 --> 00:12:35,531
is lower than these.

281
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:37,902
However, the bigger source of income for the government

282
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:40,144
is still borrowing.

283
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:43,150
Borrowing money is at 28%.

284
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,437
The Finance Minister has put a tagline for this budget,

285
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:48,364
Viksit Bharat by 2047.
[Developed India by 2047]

286
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:49,762
And she has also promised that

287
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:53,778
India will become a developed nation by 2047.

288
00:12:53,778 --> 00:12:56,129
And also that by 2030,

289
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:59,685
India will become a $7 trillion dollar economy.

290
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:03,233
"As per the latest report by the Finance Ministry,

291
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:05,906
the Indian economy, can, of course,

292
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:09,991
hit the, and can aspire to hit the,
$7 trillion mark by 2030."

293
00:13:09,991 --> 00:13:11,399
It sounds good to hear,

294
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,008
but the reality is revealed only when

295
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:14,676
you compare these promises

296
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:16,839
with the promises made in the previous years.

297
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,474
In the 2019 Niti Aayog meeting, PM Modi said that

298
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:24,886
he will make India a $5 trillion economy by 2024.

299
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:26,434
2024 is here,

300
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:28,539
forget about the $5 trillion economy,

301
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:31,323
India is not even a $4 trillion economy yet.

302
00:13:31,323 --> 00:13:34,577
The current status of India is a $3.7 trillion economy.

303
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:36,127
Had the government wanted,

304
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,266
they could have come up with a new 
deadline for the $5 trillion economy promise.

305
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:40,835
Even though it didn't happen by 2024,

306
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:43,708
they could have made 2026 or 2027 the new deadline,

307
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,087
but then people would have remembered that

308
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:48,598
they had already talked about 
the $5 trillion economy previously.

309
00:13:48,598 --> 00:13:50,112
Instead, the government decided that

310
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,951
this number should be pushed one step further

311
00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:55,573
and now they are promising 
a $7 trillion economy by 2030.

312
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:57,184
By the way, I would also like to remind you that

313
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:59,072
around 2017-18

314
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,401
they were talking about a New India by 2022.

315
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:04,972
In 2022, India's 75 years of independence was completed.

316
00:14:04,972 --> 00:14:07,868
So the government made it a deadline.

317
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:10,049
And PM Modi had promised that

318
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,628
every person, every citizen

319
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:14,862
will have a home to live peacefully by 2022.

320
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,278
It was also said that by 2022,

321
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:31,822
farmers' income will be doubled

322
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:34,492
and there will be bullet trains in India.

323
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:36,373
This deadline has been pending for 2 years.

324
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:40,074
Mark my works, when India will actually 
become a $5 trillion economy,

325
00:14:40,074 --> 00:14:42,417
which will definitely happen someday, no doubt about it,

326
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:44,358
because there's GDP growth.

327
00:14:44,358 --> 00:14:48,206
Then you'll see how it will be 
presented as a new achievement.

328
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:52,115
The Finance Minister focused on 
4 main sections of society in the budget.

329
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:56,970
Poor people, women, youth, 
and the ones who feed us, the farmers.

330
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,789
She said that their welfare

331
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:00,344
is the government's highest priority.

332
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,784
Only when they progress,

333
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:03,354
will the country progress.

334
00:15:03,354 --> 00:15:04,590
It's absolutely correct.

335
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,968
But the reality is that

336
00:15:05,968 --> 00:15:09,677
India's ranking in the Hunger Index is falling.

337
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:14,489
Today, India's ranking is 111 out of 125 on the Hunger Index

338
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:17,394
which reveals the widespread hunger in the country.

339
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:20,267
Youth Unemployment is at 45%

340
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,766
for the ages of 20-24.

341
00:15:22,766 --> 00:15:25,412
Women's labour participation in India's workforce

342
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:27,665
has been falling for the past few years.

343
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:29,918
In 2005, it used to be 32%

344
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:32,892
In 2021, it was only 19%.

345
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:35,802
And here, the middle class is facing 
more and more difficulties.

346
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,176
Look at this chart.

347
00:15:37,176 --> 00:15:40,908
This chart shows that between 2016 and 2021,

348
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:45,707
the increase and decrease in household 
income across various sections in India.

349
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:48,378
The richest 20% of the population of the country,

350
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:52,561
their income has increased by a good 40%.

351
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:56,029
And the upper middle class got some benefits too.

352
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:01,091
But the actual middle class, lower middle 
class, and the poor people of the country,

353
00:16:01,091 --> 00:16:03,863
have seen only losses in the last few years.

354
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,257
Their income has decreased.

355
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,149
And the worst impact of it

356
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:10,172
has been on the poorest 20% of the people.

357
00:16:10,172 --> 00:16:14,283
This data was published by 
India's Consumer Economy 360 survey.

358
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:15,612
The unfortunate thing is that

359
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:19,082
it is becoming increasingly difficult to access 
such data in the country with each day.

360
00:16:19,082 --> 00:16:23,795
Because the government simply does not 
disclose the uncomfortable data to the public.

361
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:25,396
At the bottom of this chart it is written that,

362
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:26,766
"Official public data on

363
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:29,285
Indian income and consumption inequality

364
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:31,081
has become very hard or impossible

365
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:33,488
to be obtained in recent years."

366
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:34,690
Look at this article from 27th March,

367
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,213
the Union government has no data

368
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:39,195
on India's offshore shell companies.

369
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:40,905
Neither does the government have data on

370
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:43,676
how many farmers were k!lled in the farmers' protests.

371
00:16:43,676 --> 00:16:47,020
Nor does it have data on how many 
migrants faced difficulties during COVID.

372
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:50,090
Nor does it have data on how many 
people were k!lled in mob lynching

373
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,901
nor the data on how many MSMEs 
had to be shut down during lockdown.

374
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:57,465
This is why opposition leaders 
have often mocked the government

375
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:00,674
saying that NDA means No Data Available.

376
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:02,674
And the things for which 
there's some kind of data available

377
00:17:02,674 --> 00:17:03,946
it's impossible to know

378
00:17:03,946 --> 00:17:05,971
which data to trust.

379
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:08,459
While announcing this budget, the Finance Minister said that

380
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,839
in the last 10 years, the government has

381
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,794
assisted 250 million people to get 
freedom from multi-dimensional poverty.

382
00:17:13,794 --> 00:17:15,435
"In these 10 years,

383
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:16,645
the Government has assisted

384
00:17:16,645 --> 00:17:19,445
25 crore people 
[250 million people]

385
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:23,536
to get freedom from multi-dimensional poverty."

386
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:26,623
But last year, in December, Amit Shah had said that,

387
00:17:26,623 --> 00:17:28,425
the Modi government had

388
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:31,025
help 600 million people to be free from poverty.

389
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:33,741
So is the 250 million number correct?

390
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:35,357
Or the 600 million?

391
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:36,212
No idea.

392
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:37,925
Anyways, coming back to the budget,

393
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:40,439
this was the story of this year's Interim Budget.

394
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:42,471
We will get to know the rest of the details

395
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:44,502
when the full budget is presented in July.

396
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:47,381
The link to check out Scaler 
will be in the description below.

397
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:48,936
If you liked this video,

398
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:52,487
you can go and watch this video on Inflation.

399
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:53,947
In this, I talk about

400
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,619
if inflation is a good thing or a bad thing.

401
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:58,033
If inflation is not good,

402
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,096
then is Deflation good?

403
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:03,773

404
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:04,767
Thank you very much!
