1
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:06,668
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:06,668 --> 00:00:09,646
Today, China is one of the most
powerful countries in the world.

3
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:13,043
But can you imagine that only 40 years ago,

4
00:00:13,043 --> 00:00:16,317
the poverty rate in this country was over 90%?

5
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:19,546
Poverty and starvation
had made the country miserable.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,951
But in the next 30 years,

7
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:26,518
we saw such a huge transformation

8
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:28,258
that the poor, starving
country reached thus far.

9
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:32,095
In 1978, China's contribution to the global GDP

10
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:33,395
was only 2%.

11
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:38,000
Today, China contributes more than 18%
to the global GDP.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,799
Their poverty rate is less than 1%

13
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,732
and China is the second-largest economy in the world.

14
00:00:43,732 --> 00:00:47,857
In many ways,
it can be considered a superpower country.

15
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:49,828
But how was this possible?

16
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:51,707
What was the magic they used?

17
00:00:51,707 --> 00:00:55,346
Come, in this video,
let's do a detailed case study on China.

18
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,974
"China was emerging from its cultural revolution

19
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,175
as one of the world's poorest nations."

20
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:03,093
"1978, Deng Xiaoping, had an idea,

21
00:01:03,093 --> 00:01:05,669
one that would turn Communist China on its head."

22
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:06,860
"Since then, China has made

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,106
enormous strides in various fields."

24
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:11,247
"So how did one of the world's poorest countries

25
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:13,463
become a global superpower

26
00:01:13,463 --> 00:01:15,369
in just 4 decades?"

27
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:18,925
China is named after the Chinese word, Qin.

28
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:20,808
It is written as Q-I-N

29
00:01:20,808 --> 00:01:22,577
but pronounced as Chin.

30
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:24,772
Qin was the name of an old dynasty

31
00:01:24,772 --> 00:01:27,268
which ruled China 2000 years ago

32
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:28,964
and unified China.

33
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,209
This is why we refer to Chinese people

34
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:32,930
as Chini in Hindi.

35
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,768
What came from Chin is Chini.

36
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:36,705
And another interesting fact here about

37
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:39,152
the actual ‘Chini’, the Hindi name for
white refined sugar.

38
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:41,885
It is believed that refined white sugar

39
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:44,077
was brought to India by a Chinese man.

40
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:46,025
A Chinese man either opened a sugar mill

41
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:47,962
or somehow sugar came from the Chinese route.

42
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:50,680
Before that, we used
unrefined sugar and jaggery.

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,712
Because a Chini person brought sugar,

44
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,381
we started calling the sugar Chini.

45
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,002
Another interesting fact here is that

46
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:58,568
Chinese people do not refer to their country as China.

47
00:01:58,568 --> 00:02:01,692
They use the name Zhongguo.
for their country.

48
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:03,370
It means the Middle Kingdom.

49
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,654
It symbolizes China's 4000 years old history.

50
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:09,211
How China used to be the centre of the world.

51
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:10,199
It was in the middle.

52
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,340
You can see on the map,

53
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,669
China is the world's 4th largest country.

54
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:15,538
It borders India.

55
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:17,908
But most of the Chinese population

56
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:20,559
actually lives quite far from India,
on the East Coast.

57
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:24,037
This is because the fertile land
on which agriculture is possible

58
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:25,874
is mostly situated in that area.

59
00:02:25,874 --> 00:02:28,315
In the West, there are the
Himalayan mountains and deserts.

60
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,049
Because of its size,
China used to be a very successful

61
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:33,422
and powerful kingdom till the 19th century.

62
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:36,556
And after that,
it was affected by colonialism.

63
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:40,172
Although the British could not fully occupy China,

64
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:42,148
as they did on the Indian subcontinent,

65
00:02:42,148 --> 00:02:44,895
but still, China was looted in different ways.

66
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:48,914
This is the reason why

67
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:52,079
the period from 1839 to 1949 is remembered

68
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,930
as the Century of Humiliation by the Chinese.

69
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,417
It starts in 1839
when the British East India Company

70
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:01,012
began exporting opium to China.

71
00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:05,323
Opium is a drug to which
many Chinese people got heavily addicted

72
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:07,536
and the entire Chinese society was destroyed.

73
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:10,361
After this, many treaties were forced upon China,

74
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:11,722
per which, China had to hand over

75
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:13,972
significant portions of land and its ports to the British.

76
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:16,960
Then, in 1850, there was
a terrible civil war in China

77
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,418
called the
Taiping Rebellion.

78
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:19,534
Millions of people were killed.

79
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,391
Fast forward 40 years,

80
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:24,701
and you see the first Sino-Japanese War in 1894.

81
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:28,041
China and Japan went to war over territory.

82
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:32,313
I won't go into the details,

83
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:35,200
but the Qing Dynasty was ruling China at that time.

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,002
Don't confuse it with the Qin dynasty,

85
00:03:37,002 --> 00:03:38,859
the root of the name 'China'.

86
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:40,801
That Qin dynasty is 2,000 years old.

87
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:44,170
This was the Q-I-N-G dynasty.

88
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,393
The other was the Q-I-N dynasty.

89
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:46,432
Same pronunciation.

90
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:49,149
From 1937 to 1945,

91
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:52,353
Chinese people had to
endure even more terrible torture.

92
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:55,356
This time, by the hands of Japanese colonisers.

93
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:56,637
In the World War 2 video,

94
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,517
I explained how China was a part of the Allied Powers.

95
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:01,162
It was fighting against Japan.

96
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:04,375
In World War 2, around 30 million Chinese were killed.

97
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,055
In the midst of all this,
a ray of hope was seen when

98
00:04:07,055 --> 00:04:10,630
China and the Allied Forces
finally won World War II.

99
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,522
Japan retreated

100
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:14,097
But right after the end of WWII,

101
00:04:14,097 --> 00:04:16,991
a civil war broke out in China.

102
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:21,875
A war between the Chinese Communist Party
and the Nationalist Party, KMT.

103
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,613
It started in 1927,

104
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:26,853
but when Japan invaded during World War II,

105
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:29,082
they had stopped fighting temporarily.

106
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:31,787
The civil war ended in 1949

107
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:34,464
with the victory of the Chinese Communist Party.

108
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:36,378
The people of the Nationalist Party

109
00:04:36,378 --> 00:04:37,925
fled to a nearby island,

110
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:40,501
which is now called Taiwan.

111
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,557
And the mainland China

112
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:45,311
was ruled by Mao Zedong.

113
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:47,317
This was the point where it can be said that

114
00:04:47,317 --> 00:04:49,821
China was formed as the country we now know.

115
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:51,637
1st October 1949,

116
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:54,403
People's Republic of China was born.

117
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:55,974
"The leader of the Communists,

118
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:57,548
and the hero of the revolution,

119
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:58,818
is Mao Zedong."

120
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:12,162
In 1958, Mao launched

121
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:14,671
the Great Leap Forward Campaign.

122
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:16,953
Its aim was to bring economic

123
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:18,973
and social transformation to the country.

124
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,227
There were two main policies in this.

125
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:23,053
First, to take the land from the landowners

126
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:24,635
and distribute it among the farmers.

127
00:05:24,635 --> 00:05:26,073
Land redistribution.

128
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:29,351
Thereafter, collectivizing agriculture.

129
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:31,369
Agricultural cooperatives were made so that

130
00:05:31,369 --> 00:05:33,797
more farmers could work on the same land.

131
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,878
But ultimately, the ownership of the land

132
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,453
was in the hands of the government.

133
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:39,238
Second, industrialization.

134
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,323
On the one hand, large industrial plants were built for steel production.

135
00:05:42,323 --> 00:05:44,940
And on the other hand,
telling people to make

136
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,461
small-scale steel furnaces in their backyards

137
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:50,533
to produce steel at a local level.

138
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:51,729
The intention was good.

139
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:53,604
To develop the country economically.

140
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,563
But the result was very bad.

141
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:59,912
The small-scale steel furnaces that people had built in their gardens

142
00:05:59,912 --> 00:06:03,474
were producing low-quality steel.

143
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:05,085
This led to the resources being wasted.

144
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:06,653
Secondly, the farmers did not have

145
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:08,745
any incentive to increase their production

146
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:10,228
because there was no profit sharing

147
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:12,087
and no private ownership.

148
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:13,256
The ownership of the land was ultimately

149
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,941
in the hands of the government.

150
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,166
So, whatever crop was being grown by the farmers,

151
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,356
had to be handed over to the government.

152
00:06:18,356 --> 00:06:21,122
This led to a huge decline in productivity.

153
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:23,003
Between 1958 and 1961,

154
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:25,436
the grain production fell by 15%.

155
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:27,775
In just a few years,
due to bad weather and

156
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:30,343
some other “masterstroke” policies of
the Mao regime,

157
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:34,225
the situation got so bad that
the whole country was starving.

158
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:35,944
The famine was so terrible that

159
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:40,102
around 20-40 million people died in this famine in China.

160
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:42,989
It is known as one of the deadliest famines
in history.

161
00:06:42,989 --> 00:06:46,005
To put it bluntly,
Mao Zedong was a dictator.

162
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,902
And because there is no
checks and balances system for dictators,

163
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:51,702
as there is in a democracy,

164
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,721
dictators often have a habit of

165
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:57,785
imposing their wills without thinking or testing.

166
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:02,104
Several such decisions by Mao
made China worse.

167
00:07:02,104 --> 00:07:04,128
Another example of such decisions

168
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:05,828
was the Sparrow Extermination.

169
00:07:05,828 --> 00:07:08,162
Mao's intention was to
increase food production.

170
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,435
So, it was ordered that all the sparrows,

171
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:12,459
and all the birds should be killed

172
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,843
because those birds ate the grains.

173
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:17,029
They eat some crop grains from the fields.

174
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:19,269
So, the crops are affected by the crops,

175
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:21,317
so all the birds in the country were to be exterminated.

176
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,915
When this campaign was run,
and sparrows were killed,

177
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:25,487
a few years later, people realised that

178
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:29,291
the insects and pests were multiplying so rapidly

179
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,538
they were causing more damage to the crops.

180
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:34,520
This worsened the food shortage.

181
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,063
Later, a scientist found that if all the birds are killed,

182
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:41,752
then no one would be left to eat those insects.

183
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,775
The birds used to eat the insects

184
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,986
which kept the insect population in control.

185
00:07:45,986 --> 00:07:48,878
The entire ecological balance was disturbed.

186
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:50,879
And the situation worsened so terribly
that it led to a famine.

187
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,074
After such a big failure, Mao was criticized

188
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:57,202
by the Chinese public and by the Communist Party too.

189
00:07:57,202 --> 00:08:00,284
But Mao Zedong was not willing to admit his mistake.

190
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:02,314
Another campaign was started.

191
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:05,164
Cultural Revolution in 1966.

192
00:08:05,164 --> 00:08:07,486
The name suggests that it was meant to

193
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,028
bring a revolution of culture in the country

194
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:10,800
but the real purpose was

195
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,030
to give control to Mao
and suppress the opposition.

196
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,558
Propaganda and PR machinery
were used extensively here.

197
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:22,556
To show off his power, Mao swam in
the Yangtze River.

198
00:08:22,556 --> 00:08:24,459
There is a famous photo of him.

199
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,966
A civilian army is formed by the students

200
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,137
the Red Guards.

201
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:30,636
Red Guards were loyal soldiers of Mao who had

202
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,729
red armbands on their hands

203
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,842
and they used to carry
a small red book by Mao.

204
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:40,058
Their job was to target those who were against Mao.

205
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:45,206
Intellectuals, party officials, all those
who were not loyal to Mao's ideology,

206
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:48,625
were targeted, publicly humiliated

207
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,530
and often, violence
against them was also seen.

208
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,179
There were people in the Communist Party who

209
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:56,472
were criticizing the Cultural Revolution,

210
00:08:56,472 --> 00:08:57,749
criticizing Mao,

211
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:00,695
and they were also targeted
by the Red Guards.

212
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:03,415
Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping

213
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:07,094
were some of the high-ranking party officials,

214
00:09:07,094 --> 00:09:08,851
targeted by the Red Guards.

215
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:12,549
In the name of this revolution, a fear environment
was created in the whole country.

216
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:17,400
People were encouraged to spy on their neighbours, family members,

217
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,126
to find the traitors,

218
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:24,607
a traitor was someone who was against Mao's ideology,

219
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,288
people had to find them and report about them.

220
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:28,842
Schools and universities were shut down.

221
00:09:28,842 --> 00:09:31,701
Students were told to go to the farms and

222
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:33,250
learn the condition of the farmers.

223
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,406
To experience the hardships of rural life.

224
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:39,158
As time passed, things became out of control.

225
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:41,416
Red Guards started fighting among themselves.

226
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:45,679
Historical sites and cultural artifacts were destroyed.

227
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,704
People's lives were turned upside down.

228
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:50,794
This was the time when
Tibetans were also tortured.

229
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:53,526
I have told you the story in the Dalai Lama video.

230
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,729
If you haven't seen it, I will put the link
in the description below.

231
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,488
Finally, Mao realized

232
00:09:58,488 --> 00:10:00,468
the Cultural Revolution

233
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:02,229
created a crisis in the country.

234
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:04,425
It was dividing the country.

235
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:07,876
So, in 1968, to regain control,

236
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:11,026
the Red Guards system was abolished.

237
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:13,568
The estimates vary a lot depending upon the source,

238
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:18,800
but it is said that hundreds of thousands to 2 million people

239
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,971
lost their lives because of the Cultural Revolution.

240
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:24,579
In total, it is said that up to 50 million people

241
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:27,272
died in China because of Mao's policies.

242
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:31,789
In 1976, Mao Zedong passed away due to poor health.

243
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:35,147
And till then, there were no major improvements to China's condition.

244
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:38,298
But it is not that there were only failures and bad things

245
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:39,236
during Mao's reign.

246
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:40,933
There were some positive achievements too.

247
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:44,352
Especially in terms of women's equality and education.

248
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:48,113
A nationwide public education system was launched during Mao's rule.

249
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:51,648
Campaigns were run by the government to end illiteracy.

250
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:53,284
And during Mao's leadership,

251
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:55,621
China's literacy rate improved a lot.

252
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:59,015
In 1978, compared to 1949,

253
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:02,050
China had 3 times more
primary and secondary schools.

254
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,665
At the same time, a strong foundation was formed

255
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,472
with the help of which China helped
millions of people to get out of poverty.

256
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:09,318
Moving forward, as you will see in the story,

257
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:11,810
his government made strategic investments

258
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,630
in education, in the fields of science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics,

259
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,580
which are called
STEM fields.

260
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,651
With the help of this, a talent pool was created in the country,

261
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:23,493
which led the country's technological progress.

262
00:11:23,493 --> 00:11:25,938
Today, software development and data science

263
00:11:25,938 --> 00:11:29,893

289
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:42,337
And now let's get back
to the topic of the video.

290
00:12:42,337 --> 00:12:44,065
Mao's opinion about women was that

291
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:45,759
"Women hold up half the sky."

292
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,678
In 1950, a new marriage law was passed according

293
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:52,495
to which arranged marriages and forced marriages

294
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:54,841
were made illegal across the country.

295
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,967
Women were given the right to divorce and

296
00:12:56,967 --> 00:13:01,047
in many other aspects, women were brought on equal footing.

297
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,219
But if we come back to the time of 1976,

298
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:07,936
a new leader comes to power after Mao's death in China,

299
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:10,109
in the Chinese Communist Party,

300
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:11,339
Deng Xiaoping.

301
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,753
He is also called the father of modern China

302
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:15,343
because during his leadership,

303
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:17,932
the real transformation of China begins.

304
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:23,911
Deng Xiaoping was one of those who raised

305
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,826
his voice against Mao during Mao's time.

306
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:28,072
Because of this, during the Cultural Revolution,

307
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:30,782
he was forced to resign from all his positions.

308
00:13:30,782 --> 00:13:33,268
It was obvious that Deng Xiaoping's ideology

309
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:35,597
was very different from Mao's ideology.

310
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:38,768
Deng believed that the government had extremely tight control

311
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,197
over the Chinese economy.

312
00:13:40,197 --> 00:13:43,524
Which was the cause of the destruction
of China over the preceding 50 years.

313
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:45,844
He wanted to free the economy.

314
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:50,237
That's why he introduced his policies of Economic Liberalization.

315
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:52,463
There are many aspects to this

316
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:53,876
which we will discuss one by one.

317
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:57,067
But his overall ideology is today known as

318
00:13:57,067 --> 00:14:00,565
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics.

319
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:03,147
First, to bring transformation in the agriculture system,

320
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:06,428
Deng introduced a household responsibility system.

321
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,660
When Mao launched his Great Leap Forward campaign,

322
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,361
private farming was completely abolished.

323
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:16,416
No individual was allowed to own land.

324
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,187
All ownership was in the hands of the government at the local level.

325
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:21,833
Deng did not change this ownership structure.

326
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,961
The ownership remained in the hands of
the government of the village.

327
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:27,756
But individual farmers and their families

328
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:30,730
were given the land on long-term leases.

329
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,326
Those farmers will have the right to decide

330
00:14:33,326 --> 00:14:35,096
which crops to grow,

331
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:36,787
how to manage their business

332
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:38,053
and from where to earn profit.

333
00:14:38,053 --> 00:14:41,621
So, the farmers got more freedom to grow crops of their choosing.

334
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:44,617
Second, Deng said that all farmers will have

335
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,857
to sell a certain amount of their crops to the government.

336
00:14:46,857 --> 00:14:48,906
But after meeting that quota,

337
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:52,450
they can sell the excess produce wherever they want,

338
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,062
and earn extra profit.

339
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:57,926
So, this motivated the farmers to innovate.

340
00:14:57,926 --> 00:14:59,356
Their productivity increased.

341
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,732
Some similar land reforms

342
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:02,144
were brought in India after Independence

343
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:04,427
in states like Kerala and West Bengal

344
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:06,168
which are said to be major reasons

345
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:09,184
why states like Kerala have been able to develop so much.

346
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:12,150
Although, the specifics of these reforms were different.

347
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,749
We can discuss them in another video.

348
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:17,688
But Deng Xiaoping used the same idea on factories.

349
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:20,531
Factory Manager Responsibility System was introduced.

350
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,589
Before this, during Mao's leadership,

351
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,033
the responsibility to manage the industrial factories in China

352
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:28,398
were given to the members of the Communists Party.

353
00:15:28,398 --> 00:15:30,785
There was a lot of political interference.

354
00:15:30,785 --> 00:15:32,902
But under Deng's leadership, the responsibility

355
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:35,623
was shifted to the workers and managers working in the factories.

356
00:15:35,623 --> 00:15:38,115
They allowed them more freedom to decide what

357
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:41,793
they want to produce,
their production target,

358
00:15:41,793 --> 00:15:43,723
the prices at which they will sell the products,

359
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:45,429
and the salaries they would draw.

360
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:47,742
Once again, the workers working in the factory

361
00:15:47,742 --> 00:15:50,320
got an incentive to work harder.

362
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,241
Imagine it for yourself, there is a factory that

363
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:54,113
manufactures shoes, for example.

364
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:56,929
Now, the workers and managers working in the factory

365
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:59,454
have the right to decide

366
00:15:59,454 --> 00:16:02,448
the number of shoes to be produced,
materials to be used,

367
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:07,683
the selling prices of the shoes,
and the salaries paid to them.

368
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:11,071
The workers developed a sense of ownership

369
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,394
and accountability.

370
00:16:12,394 --> 00:16:15,875
It was their factory and they could
make it successful if they wanted to.

371
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,579
During Mao's leadership, there was a lot of centralised planning.

372
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:21,941
A person sitting on top dictating everything.

373
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:23,657
How everything should be running.

374
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:25,421
The government decided everything.

375
00:16:25,421 --> 00:16:26,606
Everything that happened or did not happen.

376
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:29,742
But during the time of Deng, there was decentralization.

377
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:32,286
More freedom was given in the economic sense.

378
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:34,234
Because of all these policy measures,

379
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:35,850
millions of people started coming out of poverty and

380
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,194
people's lives started changing.

381
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:39,686
Between 1978 and 1984,

382
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:42,640
on average, agriculture output in China

383
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,867
increased at the rate of 7.4%.

384
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:47,600
The grain production in China

385
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,213
doubled between the late 1970s and mid-1980s.

386
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:53,789
The next big step was to bring about a revolution in education.

387
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:55,965
To focus on educating people.

388
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:58,522
Because of this, in 1986,

389
00:16:58,522 --> 00:17:01,772
a compulsory education law was introduced by the government.

390
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:06,515
For 9 years, free and compulsory education
for every child in China.

391
00:17:06,515 --> 00:17:08,083
Compare this to India.

392
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,781
The Right to Education Act was introduced
in India after so many years.

393
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,574
In 2009.

394
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:16,303
On top of that, there was no standstill in China after the law was passed.

395
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:20,531
The government started spending more
on people's education consistently.

396
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:24,465
In 1980, the money spent by the government on education

397
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:27,506
was approximately 2% of GDP in China.

398
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:29,077
And it kept increasing.

399
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:33,828
By 2010, it reached 4.1% of GDP.

400
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:35,842
Compare it with India.

401
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:37,788
According to the latest figure in India,

402
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:42,440
our government has spent 2.9% of the Indian GDP on education.

403
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,119
Not only that, China has also focused on
technical and vocational education.

404
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,858
People were taught the skills

405
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,530
that are actually needed in jobs.

406
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,781
Friends, if you have seen my Singapore video,

407
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,163
you might be thinking that these actions sound familiar.

408
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:56,478
Because it is, friends.

409
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:57,858
All the developed countries

410
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:00,125
have focused heavily on education.

411
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,805
And they are developed because

412
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:03,533
education was given such a big priority.

413
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,936
Because of all these measures,

414
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:08,122
we saw an amazing improvement in the literacy rate in China.

415
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:10,450
In 1982, it was at 65%

416
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,817
and in 2012, it crossed 95%.

417
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:17,746
For comparison, India's total literacy rate
is still at 77%.

418
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:21,000
Similarly, spending money on healthcare is
another big indicator.

419
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,853
In 2021, China spent 5.59% of GDP on its health.

420
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:30,623
And India, according to the 2020 data,
spent around 2.96%.

421
00:18:30,623 --> 00:18:32,766
The next development strategy of Deng Xiaoping

422
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:34,991
was Township and Village Enterprises,

423
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:36,951
also known as TVEs.

424
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:40,469
This is quite similar to the cooperative model
of India in many ways.

425
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:42,859
Cooperatives are usually owned in India by

426
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:45,201
the workers working in the cooperatives.

427
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:48,226
but on the other hand, the ownership of TVEs,

428
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,962
are held by townships and villages.

429
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:52,387
Both have the same purpose

430
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:55,249
to bring economic growth in rural areas

431
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:57,265
and to improve people's living standards.

432
00:18:57,265 --> 00:18:59,283
In India, we have seen cooperatives mostly

433
00:18:59,283 --> 00:19:01,875
in the agricultural and dairy sectors, like Amul,

434
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,928
but TVEs have been seen in almost every sector in China.

435
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:08,080
Textiles, electronics, manufacturing, services.

436
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,086
In fact, a big example of TVE is Huawei Technologies.

437
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:15,615
This company started as a TVE
in the area of Shenzhen.

438
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:18,390
But today, it has become a global leader

439
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,230
in telecommunications equipment.

440
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,800
Another good example of this is the city of
Wenzhou, China.

441
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,300
Here, some local people established small factories to make shoes.

442
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,270
Slowly it expanded

443
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,500
and became so big that

444
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,960
today, the shoe industry of Wenzhou

445
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,140
is a major export sector in China.

446
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,590
The shoes made here are not only sold in China

447
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,240
but are also sold outside of China.

448
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,820
By the early 1990s, TVE was employing around

449
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,110
100 million people in China.

450
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,130
People's living standards started to increase.

451
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,820
Usually, there is an income gap in rural and urban areas.

452
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,800
But here, this income gap reduced because of TVE's.

453
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,110
About 20% of China's total industrial output

454
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,990
was from TVE's in the 1990s.

455
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,630
Millions of jobs were generated because of this.

456
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,310
But this could only happen when people were

457
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,880
already educated and skilled to do all this.

458
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,850
In 1980, Deng set up special economic zones in China,

459
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,020
in which tax incentives were given,

460
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,670
the bureaucratic process was made easier,

461
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,180
fewer regulations were imposed

462
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,770
so that foreign investment could flow into the country.

463
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,340
Many times, when people tell the story of China's development,

464
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,780
they mention this point first.

465
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,070
But I am mentioning this point later because

466
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,890
to reach this point,

467
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,710
China had to take many other steps,

468
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,260
to make this possible,

469
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,250
to bring in foreign investment successfully.

470
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,890
When foreign companies invest in the country,

471
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,650
they need skilled people.

472
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,230
If people are not educated and skilled,
no one will invest money.

473
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,510
Here, the labour was cheap, people were skilled,

474
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,710
only a little bureaucracy,

475
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,020
and people already had the experience required because of TVEs.

476
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,530
Shenzhen became the first Special Economic Zone in China.

477
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,210
This city used to be a small fishing village

478
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:00,780
but in a few years, it became a major international metropolis.

479
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,060
In 1980, Shenzhen's GDP was 0.3 billion dollars.

480
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,680
By 2020, it reached 420 billion dollars.

481
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,630
To encourage foreign companies to come to the country,

482
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,960
an open-door policy was made.

483
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,360
China's economy was open to the world.

484
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,570
This is called economic liberalization.

485
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,140
It was done in China in 1978.

486
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,790
And in India, Economic liberalization was seen later, in 1991.

487
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,370
"We are in a phase of restructuring our economy.

488
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,550
...that our country is unable to launch

489
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,660
a certain industrial revolution,

490
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,790
a certain agricultural revolution,

491
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,440
...that our country is unable to integrate itself

492
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,870
into the world economy,

493
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,730
in a manner in which we can take advantage of the opportunities

494
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,820
offered by the new global economy."

495
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,260
Because of this, many multinational companies

496
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,640
like Nike, Apple, Volkswagen

497
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,290
set up their manufacturing facilities in China.

498
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:01,410
In 1980, China's FDI was $0.06 billion.

499
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,160
In 2021, it exceeded $333 billion.

500
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,990
Apart from all this, the government also focused
on infrastructure development.

501
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,760
Railway lines were built,
good public transport in cities.

502
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,820
And along with this, the government made scientific research a priority.

503
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,380
The Deng introduced a crash training program

504
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,770
for more than 800,000 Chinese researchers.

505
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,570
Priority areas were made.

506
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,530
Energy production, computers, optics,

507
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,990
space technology, physics, and genetics.

508
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,820
These science research centers were given
heavy funding by the government.

509
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,330
The money spent on research and development

510
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,540
was gradually increased by the government

511
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,290
and in 2020, it crossed $500 billion.

512
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,920
A big example of this

513
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,110
is the Zhongguancun Science Park in Beijing

514
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,950
built in 1988.

515
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,180
It is a hub of technology
and innovation.

516
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,010
Many high-tech companies, research institutions,

517
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,580
and universities are situated here.

518
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,880
In 1990, India and China
were almost on the same line.

519
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,180
In fact, if you look at GDP per capita,

520
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,620
India's GDP per capita was more than China's.

521
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,420
$1,202 vs. $983 for China.

522
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,090
But their change was so remarkable that today,

523
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,160
China's GDP per capita is more than three times that of India's.

524
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,880
According to the 2020 figures,

525
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,110
India's is $6,454 and

526
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,810
China is at $17,312.

527
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,610
With regard to these revolutionary policies

528
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,550
Deng Xiaoping said that

529
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,920
he took the approach of
"crossing the river by feeling the stones".

530
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,630
That we cross the river by evaluating at each and every stone

531
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,050
Every decision that was taken

532
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,420
was taken in a pragmatic and practical manner.

533
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,170
After a lot of thought.

534
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,410
It is not that a dictator had an abrupt idea

535
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,710
of what could be done to change the country,

536
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,840
And without any further thought
or consultations with advisors,

537
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,260
the Dictator imposed his decision.

538
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,390
We learn from Deng Xiaoping that how bringing reforms

539
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,400
is a gradual process

540
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,390
that should be undertaken after thorough evaluations.

541
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,560
It should be tested at every step

542
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,110
and the policies should be adjusted as needed.

543
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,990
It is not that Deng Xiaoping was

544
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,290
a perfect hero in our story.

545
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,980
Or that he did not do anything wrong.

546
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,750
Economically, his ideology did favour freedom

547
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,750
but politically, he was still a dictator.

548
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,160
It was during his reign that in 1989,

549
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,620
the Tiananmen Square massacre
took place.

550
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,950
One thing that was ignored in all these policies

551
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,210
was the environment.

552
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,090
What effect did it have on the ecology?

553
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,640
And the authoritarianism that continued during Deng Xiaoping's reign

554
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,590
resulted in the present-day conditions under Xi Jinping's rule.

555
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,970
Had Deng Xiaoping wanted,

556
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,280
he could have transitioned
China into a democracy.

557
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,770
But he didn't.

558
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,790
For this reason, today, a dictator emerged

559
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,180
who again runs his own will

560
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,690
and imposes decisions without thinking twice.

561
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,060
This is the reason why during the pandemic in 2020,

562
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,800
China saw many scary lockdowns.

563
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,990
Restrictions are being imposed on people's
freedom once again.

564
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,980
For now, if you liked this video,

565
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,120
you will also like the Singapore video

566
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,220
in which I have explained how Singapore

567
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,530
became the number one country in Asia.

568
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,230
You can click here to watch it.

569
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,610
And I'll see you in the next video.

570
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,750
Thank you very much!
