1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,520
Love makes a heart

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,400
Love breaks a heart

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,720
Erase me, or embrace me

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,200
I have chosen you

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,720
Dyed in your myriad colours

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,320
I belong to you

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,560
Love cannot be measured or hidden

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,400
I've left the world for you

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,120
I cannot stay away

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,840
when I hear you call

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,040
Lost in you, the world is lost
to me

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,680
I cannot stay away

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,040
when I hear you call

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,400
Lost in you, the world is now lost
to me

15
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,120
I've left the world for you

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,400
My heart is yours

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,240
I am all yours

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,720
I am lost in you

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,320
I've left the world for you

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,800
My heart is yours

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,360
I am all yours

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,400
I am lost in you

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,040
Love makes a heart

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,360
Love breaks a heart

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,120
Make me laugh or cry

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,600
I have chosen you

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,000
The world tells us love is a mistake

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,560
But my heart consents

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,160
I see God's light glow in you

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,760
I fill with pride knowing you're mine

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,920
I cannot stay away

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,040
when I hear you call

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,640
Lost in you, the world is lost
to me

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,800
I cannot stay away

35
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,080
when I hear you call

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,680
Lost in you, the world is lost
to me

37
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,640
Love is like a dream

38
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,320
My love has no bounds

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,360
I could kiss the words you speak,
soft as Urdu verse

40
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,000
Love is like a dream

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,440
My love has no bounds

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,200
I could kiss the words you speak,
soft as Urdu verse

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,080
I've left the world for you

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,680
My heart is yours

45
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,040
I am all yours now

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,640
I am lost in you
