00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:10,487
I like to introduce to the man..

00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:14,487
..the myth and the most
wanted outlaw of the world D.

00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:43,447
"Everybody is busy battling
and life has been locked."

6
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:47,647
"Every minute selfie sis
clicked and posted on instagram."

7
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:52,087
"24 hours on phone
and life is on loan."

8
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:55,967
"He cannot do anything
and finds faults in others."

9
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:57,847
"The nation wants to know."

10
00:02:58,087 --> 00:02:59,927
"The nation wants to know."

11
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:04,327
"There is nothing to say
but the nation wants to know."

12
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:06,207
"Your world has become useless."

13
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,247
"Your world has become useless."

14
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:10,207
"Your world has become useless."

15
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:11,967
"Oh God.."

16
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:14,527
"Your world has become useless."

17
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:16,687
"Why don't you understand?"

18
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:20,407
"Your world has become useless.
Oh God.."

19
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:41,967
"Thousands of scams happen in crores."

20
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:46,047
"Money is power and will
get anything done from anyone."

21
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:50,247
"Every hour there is breaking news.
At least million views."

22
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:54,647
"They unnecessary create
issues and main issue is ignored."

23
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:56,287
"The nation wants to know."

24
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,367
"The nation wants to know."

25
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:02,887
"There is nothing to say
but the nation wants to know."

26
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:04,927
'Your world has become useless."

27
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:06,807
"Your world has become useless."

28
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:10,007
"Your world has become useless.
Oh God.."

29
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:13,007
"Your world has become useless."

30
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:15,087
"Why don't you understand?"

31
00:04:15,407 --> 00:04:18,807
"Your world has become useless.
Oh God.."

32
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:27,647
So Mr. Vachani you want to say that..

33
00:04:28,607 --> 00:04:31,167
..the core committee
does not take responsibility..

34
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:33,407
..for spokes person's live comments.

35
00:04:33,487 --> 00:04:36,287
Look I..
- Answer my question, Mr. Vachani.

36
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:38,927
I am..
- You will have to answer my question.

37
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:39,647
Answer me first.

38
00:04:39,727 --> 00:04:42,167
Let me also...
- Answer me first, Mr. Vachani.

39
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,887
Let me speak.
- Answer me first.

40
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,927
You will have to answer Mr. Vachani.

41
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:49,007
I am speaking. Let me speak.
- Answer me.

42
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:50,007
I am giving.

43
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:51,407
Answer me.
- I am speaking.

44
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:53,167
Answer me first, Mr. Vachani.

45
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:54,327
You have to.

46
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:56,207
Okay.

47
00:04:57,247 --> 00:05:00,247
Mr Vachani who is promoting
the campaign of save water..

48
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:05,287
..has wasted one glass of water here.

49
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:10,127
This means that today without
worrying about anything..

50
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:14,207
..you are publicly going against
the cause you are supporting.

51
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:17,087
Why don't you let me speak anything?
- Answer me first.

52
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,727
Shall I say something?
- You have to answer me.

53
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:21,967
Okay.

54
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:26,607
You have thrown the political
ideology of your party on my face.

55
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:28,407
What are you saying?
- You cannot do that.

56
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:32,647
That means you do not believe in
the political ideology of your party.

57
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:34,367
I..
- That's what you want to say.

58
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:39,527
You have insulted and made fun of
the 150 years old party, Mr. Vachani.

59
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:40,807
There is no joke..

60
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:43,447
Come on sir let's go. It is
live telecast. Everybody is listening.

61
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:44,487
Let's go sir.

62
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:47,047
Hey, he is amazing.

63
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:51,127
He is talking nonstop like
bullet train without a break.

64
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:53,527
If you call us in studio..

65
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:55,207
..then give us chance to speak.
- You answer me.

66
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:56,047
Let's go sir.

67
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:58,687
Do you know how much preparation
we do before coming here?

68
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:00,167
Let's go.
- He does not understand.

69
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:01,207
It is a limit.
Leave me.

70
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:02,687
Answer me Mr. Vachani.

71
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:04,287
He..
- You cannot leave like this.

72
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:05,887
It is matter of everyday.

73
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:09,087
Come every day and
get insulted in Prime time.

74
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,567
You..
- What do you have to say my friend?

75
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:12,567
You tell me.

76
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:13,967
Understand one thing that..

77
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:16,487
..even politicians have some dignity.
Understood.

78
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:18,527
Do answer me Mr. Vachani.

79
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:20,327
You cannot do that.

80
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:23,327
Mr. Vachani you have to answer.

81
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:27,327
Give the phone to Pankaj.

82
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,527
Pankaj, first of all cut the feed now.

83
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:34,127
And switch it to something else.

84
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:35,047
Anything.

85
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:39,287
And secondly remove Arnab
from prime time slot from Monday.

86
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:41,847
Listen, ask Neha to come to studio.

87
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:49,647
Everyone go out.
I want to talk to Arnab.

88
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:52,927
Hey, go out.

89
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:55,647
What?

90
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:56,887
Hey..

91
00:06:58,607 --> 00:06:59,807
How did you get wet?

92
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,167
I threw water on myself.

93
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:03,287
I can give away my life.
- Yes of course.

94
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:07,207
Listen, Arnab from tomorrow
you will do the 7-8PM slot.

95
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:09,847
Now will I have to do 7-8 as well?

96
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,487
No, no you will have to do that only.

97
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:12,647
Only that.

98
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:14,367
What?
- Yes.

99
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,527
7-8 PM means.

100
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:20,047
Now will I tell people
how to cook food?

101
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:23,247
Yes. It is cookery slot so understand
what and how you will do it.

102
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:24,567
What the hell Roy?

103
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:26,687
What the hell? You tell me.

104
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:29,207
Really.

105
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:31,647
First you were saying that TRP is
not coming and losses are mounting up.

106
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,487
Now TRP is coming
and you have a problem.

107
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:34,647
Do you increase TRP like this?

108
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:36,527
Is this the way to increase TRP?

109
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:40,407
Okay.

110
00:07:40,647 --> 00:07:43,127
Now you remember the
chapters of moral science.

111
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:44,407
Very nice.

112
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:48,647
What happened?

113
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:50,807
Burn it.
- Warning comes downstairs.

114
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,527
Look at Neha's shows, buddy.

115
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:58,127
Pure fashion reporting
delivered with a pinch of salt.

116
00:07:58,527 --> 00:07:59,727
And ratings are good too.

117
00:07:59,807 --> 00:08:00,847
Nobody is complaining.

118
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:03,487
Roy, to make shows
on lingerie and sex..

119
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,207
..and to openly challenge
politicians on a live show..

120
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:07,447
..is two different things.

121
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:09,687
Oh hello, mind your language.

122
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:13,207
It is not lingerie show but
India's best glamour update show.

123
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:13,647
Oh.

124
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,607
I am the best news
writer in the country.

125
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:18,367
I am doing this show on Roy's request.

126
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:22,487
Why are you involving
me into this debate?

127
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:24,607
Take your beauty parlor out.

128
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,367
There is no need to do this here.

129
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:28,367
I am here because Roy called me.

130
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:30,647
And I am getting the
prime time slot of your show.

131
00:08:30,807 --> 00:08:31,567
Yeah..

132
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:32,647
What?

133
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:33,927
Yes..

134
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:37,047
Will Neha do prime
time slot on my place?

135
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,887
Have you literally taken
the show by its name? One on one.

136
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:42,847
If she does the show then
politicians will give fewer answers..

137
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:44,727
..and will give phone
numbers to her more.

138
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:48,047
I am leaving Roy.

139
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,847
Let me know when Mr.
Angry pans has cooled down.

140
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:52,847
I will come later.
- No, no Neha.

141
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:55,007
You are not going anywhere.
Wait, wait..

142
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:59,927
This man must know how important
it is to change with time.

143
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:02,447
Even you know that..

144
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:06,687
..Neha used to be the best
writer in the news business.

145
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:07,407
Okay.

146
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:11,727
She is doing this show
because the channel needs her.

147
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:13,127
You know flexibility.

148
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:24,087
Shut up.

149
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,207
Have cup and smell the coffee.

150
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:28,847
No one wants to see
your show nowadays.

151
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:33,327
It is okay that ratings
were fine today but at what cost.

152
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,607
Tomorrow RGV will come.

153
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:38,567
Again I will have to give answer about
6 cameras, 4 mikes and so many bones.

154
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:39,567
Do you know that?

155
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:43,047
It is not my fault that you
cannot handle political hooliganism.

156
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:45,927
My work was to handle heated
debates and that I was doing.

157
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:48,407
Until you..
Hello. What is it?

158
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,887
I said I will get the watermelon.
Watermelon, watermelon....

159
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,807
Yes baby..

160
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:57,967
Nothing, nothing..

161
00:09:58,407 --> 00:10:01,967
I have chucked out an office boy
so he is getting angry and shouting.

162
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:02,807
Yes.

163
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:04,207
I will get it.

164
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:05,647
Sure.

165
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:07,527
Bye sweetheart.

166
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:14,327
Sorry I did not see.

167
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:15,927
I was in heated debate so I got..

168
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:17,447
It was not a heated debate.

169
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:19,447
It was hardly a debate.

170
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:20,887
You had said at 10'0clock.

171
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,727
Why is so much shouting
happening outside?

172
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
Stop it.
- Stop it, Pankaj.

173
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:28,367
Don't laugh, Arnab.

174
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:34,247
A 70 year old man crying on
prime time.. it was not heated debate.

175
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:37,567
It seemed as if you have snatched
a lollipop from a 6 year old child.

176
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:39,287
Did you see the way he was crying?

177
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:42,967
But it was good one, yeah..

178
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:50,567
Arnab!

179
00:10:51,407 --> 00:10:54,327
You were a good news anchor.
- Thanks.

180
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:58,727
But this drama cannot
continue every day, buddy.

181
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:00,847
Even you know it. It is not feasible.

182
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:03,167
People want to see some real stuff.

183
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:06,047
Remember those days when
people would leave their dinner..

184
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:07,447
..and sit in front of the TV.

185
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:11,167
Which topic would Arnab discuss on?
Who will be court martial?

186
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:13,207
It's gone buddy.

187
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:16,567
Look!

188
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,007
I can't sustain like this.

189
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:26,447
Even the order from top management has
come that we have got 2 months time.

190
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,167
We have to make profit by them.

191
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,927
Otherwise everything finished.

192
00:11:32,647 --> 00:11:34,367
Channel is finished. You are finished.

193
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:38,167
You are under estimating me, Roy.

194
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:39,887
Do you remember..

195
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:42,927
..that I had brought the
channel to the top position?

196
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:45,887
It was me who had made
the channel the biggest brand.

197
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:51,087
When a person talks
about past again and again..

198
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:54,167
..then one should understand
that there is some problem.

199
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:57,367
And you very well know
it what the problem is.

200
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:00,847
Do something.

201
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,167
You can do it.
You have done it before as well.

202
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:04,847
Think huge.

203
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:10,727
Otherwise many people
are pushing me for 7-8 slot.

204
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:12,807
So now Arnab Ghosh..

205
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:16,127
..will have to compete
with chef Kapoor for screen time.

206
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,727
What the hell?
- Neha, please.

207
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,407
Buddy, think of something.

208
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:24,087
Think of something quickly.

209
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,887
We just have two months time.
- Hey..

210
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:30,167
Pankaj, will this noise stop or not?

211
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:31,407
Sir I am vinod.

212
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:34,047
Vinod, is this a
studio or a fish market?

213
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:36,007
Come baby.

214
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:13,807
"Whosoever you bless Haji Ali..."

215
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:18,567
"He need not worry at all,
Haji Ali, Haji Ali.."

216
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:23,447
"Whosoever you bless Haji Ali.."

217
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:28,127
"He need not worry at all,
Haji Ali, Haji Ali.."

218
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,567
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

219
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:32,967
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

220
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:35,367
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

221
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,247
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

222
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:49,807
"Haji Ali.."

223
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:54,247
"My Haji Ali.."

224
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:59,367
"The day is not good
so help to let it pass soon."

225
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:04,207
"Give my life a direction."

226
00:14:04,607 --> 00:14:09,007
"Change my bad luck into good luck."

227
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:14,047
"Help me to come out of problems."

228
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:23,247
"Bless me; help me to find my way."

229
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:25,807
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

230
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:28,127
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

231
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:30,567
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

232
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:32,967
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

233
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:35,327
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

234
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,807
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

235
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:40,607
"Ali, Ali Haji Ali.."

236
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:58,487
What happened? Why have you
made face like a grilled chicken?

237
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:04,127
Many people make a mistake of removing
the chicken before it is grilled.

238
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:06,207
Look at this.
It should be of this color.

239
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:08,447
Till that time let be on grill.

240
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:11,407
I am being thrashed in
the office and you are joking.

241
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:14,207
Are you just being
thrashed and not me?

242
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:16,607
That also from my own child.

243
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:19,487
It is 4th month. Do you remember?

244
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:21,887
Sorry.
- Sorry.

245
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,567
Then you must be enjoying?
- What?

246
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:27,487
I mean.. sorry baby.
After making chicken roast....

247
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:29,647
I mean..now is turn of spices.

248
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:33,847
..people are happy when the
child kicks for the first time.

249
00:15:34,327 --> 00:15:36,287
Like that I said. Yes.

250
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:38,687
You know everything..

251
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:40,927
..then you do it.

252
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:48,807
I am sorry.

253
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:50,487
How are you feeling?

254
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,847
Does someone talk like
this with pregnant woman?

255
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:54,567
Of course I am feeling awful.

256
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:56,047
Leave it.

257
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:58,087
Okay.

258
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,687
Now tell me what has happened?

259
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:04,407
Or you want me to read your face.

260
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:05,927
Shall I say the truth?

261
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:09,047
No, tell me the story of Harry Potter.
Of course, tell me the truth.

262
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:11,287
I have been removed
from the prime time slot.

263
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,727
What?
- I will do the cookery show. 7-8 PM.

264
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:14,727
Like this.

265
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:18,007
Shit.

266
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:21,127
But what happened suddenly today.

267
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:27,727
Roy said it point blankly
that we have two months.

268
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:30,567
If the ratings don't
go up we are doomed.

269
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:32,607
Channel will shut down.

270
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:38,607
You will get another assignment. I
mean there is no other Arnab in India.

271
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:40,047
It is not that easy.

272
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:43,167
I will not get a second
chance failing at my level.

273
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:46,167
And even if I get I can't
expect to be paid like before.

274
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,607
It is too much.

275
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,527
I have booked so many
thing online for the baby.

276
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:08,287
Don't worry.
We will figure something out.

277
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:10,287
Life is already going on loan.

278
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:12,567
If we do not do something quickly..

279
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:14,807
..then we will have
to come from Toyota to Tata.

280
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:18,287
If you do not have budget for
cashew nuts then there is no problem.

281
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:22,207
We can use groundnuts
to make this dish cheaper.

282
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:24,367
There will be a slight
change in taste.

283
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,807
Tell me, what you did the whole day.

284
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:31,727
Browsing but did not buy anything.

285
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:33,527
What were you finding?

286
00:17:34,807 --> 00:17:35,967
White Sari.

287
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:37,527
What?
- What?

288
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:40,887
Don't be so surprised Arnab.

289
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:43,887
I will have to buy because
of the way you insult..

290
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:45,847
..the politicians on live TV.

291
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:49,087
Sometimes I feel..

292
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,927
..I should have taken the
offer of News India two years back.

293
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:53,807
They are on top of the charts now.

294
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:55,327
Relax Arnab.

295
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:57,367
Whatever happens is for good.

296
00:17:57,807 --> 00:18:00,687
The important thing is that
you cannot control everything.

297
00:18:00,807 --> 00:18:02,047
So just let it be.

298
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,607
It is very easy to talk.

299
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:07,967
You feel regretted thinking
practically about it.

300
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,087
You know that time I got the offer.

301
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:12,367
May be.

302
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:15,847
Listen.

303
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:19,167
I have to tell you something.
- Tell me.

304
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:21,687
Tell me.

305
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,047
Do you remember the night I conceived?

306
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,687
You came late from studio that day.

307
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:37,207
Shekhar had come home before you came.

308
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:40,647
Shekhar, your ex boyfriend.

309
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,087
Okay.

310
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:46,127
We just got talking and had some wine.

311
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,447
One thing just led to another and..

312
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:50,887
I..

313
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:54,407
You know women get stupid
and emotional sometimes.

314
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:57,607
What are you going to say?

315
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,087
I..

316
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:03,247
Speak.

317
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:08,007
I am not too sure
but I am just confused.

318
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,527
Maybe this baby is yours or his..

319
00:19:13,447 --> 00:19:14,407
I don't know.

320
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:18,847
Male snake attracts the
female snake with his smell.

321
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:24,527
After the female snake agrees
they both enjoy sex for many hours.

322
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:34,047
Are you enjoying?

323
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:35,607
What do you mean by saying that?

324
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:39,447
Don't worry. It is yours.

325
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:44,567
I just wanted to say
that things can go worst.

326
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:48,847
So you learn to respect
your achievements, husband.

327
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:53,007
Relax.

328
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,807
I am going to sleep, good night.

329
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:58,207
Good night.

330
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:49,887
Okay, okay how old is the story?

331
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:51,527
Hot tea..
- Okay.

332
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:53,727
Are you sure it is untapped.
- Hot tea..

333
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,847
Hot tea..

334
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:58,207
Hot tea sir.

335
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:00,327
Hot tea sir. - Tell me
something more about the story.

336
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,127
More means more about it.
- Take it sir.

337
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:06,247
What.
- Take it sir.

338
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,647
Okay political history.

339
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:11,127
I'll call you back.

340
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:14,527
Sit down.
- What happened, sir?

341
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,887
Wasn't morning tea nice?
- Sit down.

342
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:18,287
Were the tea leaves more?

343
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:21,487
I had told the people in the
pantry that sir has gastric problem.

344
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:22,847
Put the tea leaves less.

345
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,007
Sit down.
- Okay sir.

346
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:32,967
What is this?
- This is tea sir.

347
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:34,527
It is very nice.

348
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,807
You are bringing tea
in every five minutes.

349
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:38,607
Give me time to drink tea.

350
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:41,847
Drink one more sir. It is very nice.

351
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:45,447
Tea is always hot and
people enjoy it while drinking.

352
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:47,647
Are you making me drink
tea or watering the plants?

353
00:21:47,727 --> 00:21:51,247
Sir, you are getting angry.
You work so hard.

354
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:53,247
So you will drink more tea.

355
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,007
Drink it sir.

356
00:21:55,287 --> 00:21:56,087
It is nice.

357
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:59,047
If you say it once again that it is
nice then I will press my throat or....

358
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:00,487
Don't get angry sir.

359
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:02,007
I will bring it later.

360
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:04,047
Don't bring it later.

361
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:05,407
Don't bring it.

362
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:09,407
You are a makeup and not a tea seller.

363
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:12,527
I don't understand
why are you after tea.

364
00:22:12,807 --> 00:22:15,607
There is a difference between
profession and passion, sir.

365
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:20,607
You know it well that I love to make
others drink tea from college times.

366
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:23,807
Why are you spoiling your career?

367
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:26,127
I don't see a bright future.

368
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:28,567
You cannot make a career
by making others drink tea.

369
00:22:29,207 --> 00:22:31,727
If you do hard work then one day
you will be in front of the camera.

370
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:33,407
Your mother wanted to see you on TV.

371
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:35,967
Yes sir.
She wants it but..

372
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:37,327
..what does she know about passion.

373
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,247
Sir, you don't seem
to be in god mood sir.

374
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:41,207
Oh really.

375
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:44,527
Are you getting angry with
me because of tasteless tea?

376
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:47,847
God, just kill me.

377
00:22:49,887 --> 00:22:51,847
Today I will finish this debate.
- Okay.

378
00:22:52,847 --> 00:22:53,607
Where is brother?

379
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:55,247
Where is brother?
- He is Ranchi?

380
00:22:55,327 --> 00:22:56,407
Yesterday it came in the news.

381
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:58,447
Where is your brother, idiot.

382
00:22:58,527 --> 00:22:59,527
That courier man.

383
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:00,647
Okay, choosy.

384
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:02,607
I will just call him, sir.
- Call him.

385
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:11,807
Hello.

386
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:14,567
Sorry Ajay,
I got caught up with some office work.

387
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:17,127
Tell me what you were saying.

388
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:18,327
Okay.

389
00:23:18,887 --> 00:23:19,527
Yes..

390
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:21,447
Correct, correct..

391
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:23,127
Okay..

392
00:23:24,087 --> 00:23:25,007
Yes, will see. Sir, Choosy..

393
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:28,087
Good afternoon sir.
Do you want to courier something?

394
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:29,807
Okay.

395
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:30,727
Right.

396
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:32,447
So send it till tomorrow.

397
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:33,487
Okay.

398
00:23:33,687 --> 00:23:36,127
Sir, just say yes once.

399
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:39,287
Once you said yes means
your things have gone, sir.

400
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:42,087
I will call you in five minutes.
Boss has called me. Okay.

401
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:43,407
He has called me urgently. Bye.

402
00:23:44,247 --> 00:23:46,007
Sir, did sister-in-law
get the bouquet?

403
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:47,567
Did you send it?

404
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:51,647
Listen.

405
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:54,687
Do whatever you feel is right.
I just have one request to make.

406
00:23:54,807 --> 00:23:55,407
What sir?

407
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:58,127
You make me drink the
entire year's tea in one day.

408
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:00,727
After that you will
never make me drink tea.

409
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:02,047
Okay. And you.

410
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:03,127
This..

411
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:05,407
This is your border.

412
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:08,407
You will courier things of others..

413
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:10,967
..and you will not courier
anything inside this.

414
00:24:11,327 --> 00:24:12,127
Swear it.

415
00:24:12,207 --> 00:24:13,807
Okay sir.
- Not mine but yours.

416
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:14,967
Okay sir.
- Not of yours but of each other's.

417
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:17,367
Okay..
- Get lost from here.

418
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:18,407
Okay sir.

419
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:19,807
This is your limit.

420
00:24:19,887 --> 00:24:21,007
I had told him..

421
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:22,327
..to make tea less strong

422
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:24,407
It is gas so it will
come out from somewhere.

423
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:25,487
You are right.

424
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:28,687
Yes Ajay, I was in a meeting.

425
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:29,527
Yes.

426
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:34,447
Any updates. Did Roy say anything?

427
00:24:35,047 --> 00:24:36,247
Nothing new.

428
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:39,527
You tell me how your day was.

429
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:43,327
Crime Patrol 8 episodes.

430
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:44,727
Back to back.

431
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:48,287
Wow! Women crave for sweet
or sour things in pregnancy.

432
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:50,167
My wife has craving for crime.

433
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:51,567
Thank you God.

434
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:53,887
I am blessed.
- You are such a drama.

435
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:55,607
Such a drama. God.

436
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,887
In one episode there was a guy..

437
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:01,807
..who was caught stealing
bricks from the construction site.

438
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,687
Can you believe which
gang he belonged to?

439
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:04,927
No one told me.

440
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:06,407
D gang.

441
00:25:07,447 --> 00:25:10,287
I mean imagine D gang
has to steal bricks.

442
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,727
What is so weird?
Many people of D gang are struggling.

443
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:15,447
Brother has escaped
and has left boys behind..

444
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:16,847
..to steal bricks and steel rods.

445
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:19,367
Anyways...

446
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:21,967
I have heard that he
is still active here. I mean..

447
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:23,807
People say he has
many investments here.

448
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:24,887
People say many things..

449
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:27,567
..but for me what matters
is that what you say.

450
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,487
Imagine..

451
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:32,127
..it would be so
cool to interview him.

452
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:35,047
I mean one on one
with the man himself.

453
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:36,967
Sensational.

454
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:42,367
Are you hypnotizing me?

455
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:43,967
You have already been hypnotized.

456
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:47,447
Keep these crime patrol
dangerous ideas with you.

457
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:49,527
Otherwise you will really
have to wear white sari.

458
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:50,887
You are such a buzz kill.

459
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:52,167
It did not go in the mouth.

460
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:53,127
Once more.
- Take this.

461
00:25:54,807 --> 00:25:56,887
Clean it. I am going to bed.

462
00:26:00,447 --> 00:26:01,887
I'll have two drinks and come.

463
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:12,487
Imagine it would be
so cool to interview him.

464
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:14,487
One on one with the man himself.

465
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:15,567
Sensational.

466
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:32,047
Parul.

467
00:26:33,847 --> 00:26:34,727
Parul..

468
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:37,087
Baby..

469
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:42,247
What is it Arnab so late at night?
You scared me.

470
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,527
I came to compliment you.

471
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:45,887
For what?

472
00:26:46,127 --> 00:26:49,047
You had give me a useless
idea to interview D.

473
00:26:50,047 --> 00:26:51,927
So will you insult me
by waking me up from sleep?

474
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:54,527
No, it is not a bad idea at all.

475
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:57,007
Good for you.
- I am going to pitch it Roy.

476
00:26:57,727 --> 00:26:58,847
All the best.

477
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:00,847
Are you excited?

478
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:03,607
Very much.

479
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:11,407
How did you like this idea?

480
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:13,527
What?

481
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:15,207
Is it risky?

482
00:27:17,327 --> 00:27:18,127
Don't worry..

483
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:20,807
..your birth certificate
will have my name.

484
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:24,287
You tell me what I shall
get for you from there.

485
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:26,567
Gun.

486
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:30,527
They have the real one.

487
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:32,447
Sleep.

488
00:27:32,887 --> 00:27:33,927
You are very naughty.

489
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:39,687
Remember that the flame
should not be high..

490
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:42,807
..otherwise the spoon
and wok both can burn.

491
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:46,447
Greetings, sir.

492
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:47,887
Greetings.

493
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:49,607
Sir, there is no
balance in your phone.

494
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:51,287
Do you want to get it recharged?

495
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:52,887
That will be done.

496
00:27:53,287 --> 00:27:55,647
Smiling bright face.

497
00:27:56,327 --> 00:27:58,087
Do you want to set a caller tune?

498
00:27:58,447 --> 00:28:02,687
Black hair and golden color..

499
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:04,847
How is the weather there?

500
00:28:04,927 --> 00:28:06,167
Shut up, idiot.

501
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:09,687
Girdhari, come quickly.
Brother is calling you at the pool.

502
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:15,807
How are you dear?

503
00:28:16,087 --> 00:28:17,487
You do not miss me these days.

504
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:18,607
Why should I miss you?

505
00:28:18,687 --> 00:28:20,407
I have found someone here.

506
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:21,607
You uncle..

507
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:23,167
Okay.

508
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:29,367
Yes brother.

509
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:31,287
Go and kill Sheela.

510
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:34,087
Now. I want to hear
the sound of the bullet.

511
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,927
As you say, brother.
The work will be done.

512
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,607
Okay fine.

513
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:40,447
Girdhari.

514
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:42,487
Meet him.

515
00:28:43,127 --> 00:28:46,807
He is the owner of GML group Mr.
Arshad Ansari.

516
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:47,727
Mr. Ansari.

517
00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:51,447
He is Girdhari and
takes care of my work.

518
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:52,487
Greetings..

519
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:57,727
Don't go on his face.

520
00:28:58,807 --> 00:29:02,247
He is innocent to look
at but he is very clever.

521
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:07,847
So brother, get my work
done about which I had told you.

522
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:09,807
Yes.

523
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,087
Girdhari.

524
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:13,527
He says that he had asked..

525
00:29:13,607 --> 00:29:18,127
..to threaten the builder
but we have not called.

526
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:21,927
Yes.

527
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:25,247
Tell me from there.
Tell in front of everyone.

528
00:29:25,327 --> 00:29:27,527
I don't like whispering in business.

529
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:32,607
Why are you shaking the phone?
Tell me what it is.

530
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:36,847
I did not have balance in the phone.

531
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:42,207
That is why I wanted
to tell you in your ears.

532
00:29:42,287 --> 00:29:43,847
Are all other phones dead?

533
00:29:44,327 --> 00:29:45,807
Where was Mehmood's phone?

534
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:49,487
Sir, Mehmood's phone
is not good quality.

535
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:52,047
There are so many landlines
in the house. What are they for?

536
00:29:52,127 --> 00:29:54,727
Actually brother tele marketing
people have troubled..

537
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:57,647
..people so much that
they do not pick up landline.

538
00:29:57,727 --> 00:29:59,207
I tried many times.

539
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:01,927
Mr. Ansari.

540
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,727
You go and your work will be done.

541
00:30:04,807 --> 00:30:07,847
Don't bother about what he is talking.
He has the habit of eating opium.

542
00:30:08,247 --> 00:30:10,927
Okay brother, now that you
are saying then it will be done.

543
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:16,007
You should have got it recharged.

544
00:30:16,087 --> 00:30:17,367
Bother you do not know.

545
00:30:17,447 --> 00:30:20,087
I have to beg for
100/- to the accountant..

546
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:22,447
..and he says there is no collection.
- One minute. One minute.

547
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:23,727
Is this enough for recharge?

548
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:25,247
Yes it is enough.

549
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:27,367
Brother.

550
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:30,447
For 10 days vegetables have
not been bought leave aside mutton.

551
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:32,207
Sprinkle salt on me and eat.

552
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:34,487
We are there because of you.

553
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:39,407
Sir.

554
00:30:39,847 --> 00:30:42,007
Sir, I feel to increase the TRP..

555
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:43,247
..we will have to do
something path breaking.

556
00:30:43,327 --> 00:30:45,207
Roy, you are going to thank me.

557
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:49,687
Yes, you were saying something Peter.

558
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,847
Sir. I think we will
have to do something new sir.

559
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:55,847
You say it every time but what new.

560
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:56,687
Sir.

561
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:59,287
You must have read what I had said.

562
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:00,847
Yes. What I had said?

563
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,887
I want to do something for women.

564
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:05,807
What is interesting in this?
Who will see?

565
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:06,927
Listen sir.

566
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:09,567
we will put an original twist in this.

567
00:31:09,927 --> 00:31:10,727
I am listening.

568
00:31:10,847 --> 00:31:16,527
The headlines of our news
piece would be 'Manch Pe Kiya Bawal'

569
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:18,367
I want to do women.

570
00:31:18,447 --> 00:31:20,447
It would become a rage, sir.
- Great.

571
00:31:20,527 --> 00:31:21,607
Very nice, very nice..

572
00:31:21,687 --> 00:31:23,927
Later we will put all
the blame on the edit, sir.

573
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,447
Superb.
- We are safe.

574
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:27,687
There will not be
rage but riot, idiot.

575
00:31:27,807 --> 00:31:28,687
Get out.

576
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:30,487
Good for nothing.

577
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:31,847
Sir..
- Out.

578
00:31:37,247 --> 00:31:37,847
Okay.

579
00:31:38,727 --> 00:31:41,127
So..
- Rajat, you were saying something.

580
00:31:41,207 --> 00:31:44,127
Sir, Peter spoke my idea.

581
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:47,047
This always happens, sir. I
had come here to tell you about this.

582
00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:48,687
Get out.
- Sir..

583
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:49,687
Get out.

584
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:53,607
Sir, my idea.
- Just leave.

585
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:56,127
Get out.

586
00:31:56,927 --> 00:31:58,687
Go..

587
00:32:03,567 --> 00:32:06,247
Our luck is not bad but
we have kept wrong people.

588
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:15,047
What is it? It was my idea.

589
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:16,647
Get lost.

590
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:17,327
Get lost.

591
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:19,247
It was my idea. Get lost.
- Rascal.

592
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:20,847
I will tell everyone
that it was my idea. Rascal...

593
00:32:20,927 --> 00:32:22,447
Thief..
- Go and tell.

594
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:24,007
I have seen many people like you.

595
00:32:24,447 --> 00:32:26,167
How did you like the idea?
- Rubbish idea.

596
00:32:26,927 --> 00:32:27,847
What do you think, Neha?

597
00:32:29,727 --> 00:32:33,847
Stupid, utter garbage
and I can go on and on..

598
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:36,327
Look, our luck is not bad.

599
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:37,727
What does Neha know?

600
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:41,127
Roy, I think you did
not hear it properly.

601
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:44,007
I heard it and imagined it in my mind.

602
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,647
At the end of imagination
I saw that we both are dead.

603
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:49,047
Hence.

604
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:51,087
Rubbish.

605
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:55,127
Roy, till today D
has not been interviewed.

606
00:32:55,327 --> 00:32:58,527
This is going to be big.
- Big..

607
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:01,407
D has not been interviewed because
they are many reasons behind it.

608
00:33:01,487 --> 00:33:03,447
He is dangerous, he is impossible.

609
00:33:03,727 --> 00:33:05,247
This is a life risking idea.

610
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:08,527
Every big idea seems
to be risky in the beginning.

611
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:10,047
Don't be poetic.

612
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:12,287
I asked you to get idea
to save the channel and..

613
00:33:12,327 --> 00:33:13,807
And this is what you come up with.

614
00:33:13,847 --> 00:33:16,207
Tomorrow you would say that
you need Sayyed Hafiz's interview.

615
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:18,727
Day after tomorrow
you would say that..

616
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:20,567
..you need interview
of Veerappan's cousin.

617
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:22,127
Have you gone mad?

618
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:26,687
Roy, you are saying this? It is
not that no one has done this before.

619
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:30,087
Going by the history in 1959
the famous British..

620
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:32,607
..journalist Graham
Smith had done this.

621
00:33:32,687 --> 00:33:33,807
Quite successfully.

622
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:35,847
Did he interview D?

623
00:33:37,127 --> 00:33:40,447
In 1959 D was in nursery. Why would
anyone interview a nursery child?

624
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:44,407
He interviewed the famous
mafia king of Italy Fabio Castilana.

625
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,527
The one and only interview with him.

626
00:33:48,607 --> 00:33:50,807
What happened of that
Graham Smith? He died.

627
00:33:50,887 --> 00:33:51,727
Did you see?

628
00:33:52,807 --> 00:33:54,967
He died of heart attack.
Natural death.

629
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:56,207
What to see in everything?

630
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:59,807
Whatever it was a bad idea.
Go out and get thinking.

631
00:33:59,887 --> 00:34:01,247
And let me also think.

632
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:03,407
This plan of mine..
- Even you think it over Roy.

633
00:34:03,487 --> 00:34:05,847
These TRP's and ratings
will be left behind.

634
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:08,087
This will make us legendary.

635
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:10,447
There will be no stopping us.

636
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:12,847
The door is that side. Forgive me.

637
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:15,927
Roy..Neha you tell him.
- I'll show you.

638
00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:18,727
For the fashion segment..

639
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:20,407
Our luck is bad.

640
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:23,207
Will that be okay?

641
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:30,087
Good afternoon Mr. Chopra.

642
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:34,327
We are on it.
You don't have to worry sir.

643
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:39,887
Sir, I know I have said
this many times before..

644
00:34:39,967 --> 00:34:41,847
..but this time I mean it sir.

645
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:48,727
I used to mean it earlier also
but all these things take time, sir.

646
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:54,167
I know I have less time sir.
Just 2 months.

647
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:58,687
Sir we are working on
some new ideas and I am sure..

648
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:00,687
..ratings will back up in no time.

649
00:35:02,487 --> 00:35:05,287
Trust me sir.
We will turn things around.

650
00:35:07,847 --> 00:35:10,887
Sir, you have already told
about this time of 2 months.

651
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:14,927
No, no sir I did not mean that.

652
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:16,967
You can say as many times as you want.

653
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:20,687
Okay, good day sir.

654
00:35:43,687 --> 00:35:44,327
Yes Roy..

655
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:48,127
Arnab, go ahead with the interview.

656
00:36:07,087 --> 00:36:11,047
I thought about your idea. Okay
but will what will happen with that.

657
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,887
I have ideas.

658
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:15,407
I am scared of those.

659
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:19,287
Listen to me. We will provoke him.

660
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:21,367
Okay. How?

661
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:24,887
What is D proud of the most?

662
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:28,647
Money, power, status and the
fact that people are scared of him.

663
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,887
Correct.
- So..

664
00:36:31,407 --> 00:36:33,527
We will challenge him.

665
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:37,127
We will challenge everything.
Money, power, status and everything.

666
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:38,247
What will happen because of that?

667
00:36:38,527 --> 00:36:41,607
That will make him angrier
and that is not good at all.

668
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,247
It will happen. I am telling you.

669
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:44,047
Just keep watching.

670
00:36:44,127 --> 00:36:45,407
One minute, one minute..

671
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:49,007
I don't want the channel to
be in any danger, Arnab. Understood.

672
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:50,567
Wherever there is
Arnab there is danger..

673
00:36:50,647 --> 00:36:51,967
..and wherever there
is danger there is Arnab.

674
00:36:52,047 --> 00:36:52,807
Shut up.

675
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:56,127
I have this figured out. Come on.

676
00:36:57,327 --> 00:36:58,087
Champion.

677
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:01,847
Okay.

678
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:07,527
Rami..
- Yes sir.

679
00:37:07,607 --> 00:37:09,287
I was about to get tea.

680
00:37:09,367 --> 00:37:11,327
Not tea but where is your brother?

681
00:37:11,407 --> 00:37:12,967
He is here, sir. What happened?

682
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:14,927
Did he again couriered something?

683
00:37:15,007 --> 00:37:16,847
No, no call him here in 2 minutes.

684
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:19,207
He will not be able
to come in 2 minutes.

685
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:19,807
Why?

686
00:37:20,487 --> 00:37:22,407
Because he will come in 2 seconds.

687
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:24,567
He is here. Choosy.
- Greetings sir.

688
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:27,127
What are you doing here?

689
00:37:27,327 --> 00:37:29,287
Sir, it had gone bad.
- Listen..

690
00:37:34,447 --> 00:37:34,967
Okay.

691
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:36,847
Neha, where are you?

692
00:37:38,087 --> 00:37:39,487
I need to see you immediately.

693
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:43,367
Okay, I am coming. Yes.

694
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:52,247
Parul should not come to
know about this. You know it, right.

695
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:57,367
That is about later.
First tell me that..

696
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,807
..why should I do it?

697
00:38:03,327 --> 00:38:05,087
There is no scientific reason in it.

698
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:07,287
Just do it for old times' sake.

699
00:38:09,047 --> 00:38:10,887
For old times' sake?
- Yes.

700
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:18,967
Last month when I had
asked a favor from you..

701
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:21,927
..then where had old times' gone.

702
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:23,687
You have gone mad.

703
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:26,327
You wanted to have sex with me.

704
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:29,527
And I am just telling you
to write the script of the interview.

705
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,607
There is a difference.
- What is the difference?

706
00:38:34,127 --> 00:38:36,927
That time I was desperate
and today you are desperate.

707
00:38:37,207 --> 00:38:40,927
By giving this stupid reason do not
prove yourself to be right, please.

708
00:38:42,127 --> 00:38:43,847
And what the hell are you doing?

709
00:38:44,047 --> 00:38:46,887
Okay I will write interview for you.

710
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:47,687
Thanks.

711
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:49,487
One minute, one minute..

712
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,287
That one minute has come.

713
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:54,407
Stop this striptease of yours first.

714
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:57,967
I have two conditions.

715
00:38:58,207 --> 00:39:01,487
First that you will atke
me with you for the interview.

716
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,607
And you will mention
my name on live TV.

717
00:39:05,127 --> 00:39:06,647
And give me credit for it.

718
00:39:07,047 --> 00:39:10,527
What are you saying?
I am not interviewing a street dog.

719
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:14,487
Understand the seriousness of the
situation. I am going to interview D.

720
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:15,487
It is risky.

721
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:18,967
Okay, then I have other works also.

722
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:20,247
I'll see you in some time.

723
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:24,207
Listen, okay.

724
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:28,687
Good. Now second condition.

725
00:39:28,887 --> 00:39:30,967
Now nothing. Done.

726
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:31,927
Nothing more.

727
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:41,407
After the interview
I want you for one night.

728
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:43,087
Are you crazy?

729
00:39:43,807 --> 00:39:44,647
Just think it over.

730
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:48,287
This is the biggest
interview of your life.

731
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:51,327
I am India's biggest news writer.

732
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,007
No, no..

733
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:56,127
You can think over it and let me know.

734
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,887
Listen. Okay.

735
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:02,727
Really.

736
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:07,447
I have already put my life on stake
and now let it be my dignity as well.

737
00:40:15,327 --> 00:40:20,687
I love you..you are my life

738
00:40:20,847 --> 00:40:26,287
I am living because of you.

739
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:30,807
I love you..you are my life

740
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:33,087
There is good news.
- Really.

741
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:34,687
I thought only I was
going to give good news.

742
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,927
I didn't know you also..

743
00:40:36,847 --> 00:40:37,487
What?

744
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:39,647
Roy has agreed.

745
00:40:40,047 --> 00:40:41,807
I am going to interview D.

746
00:40:41,927 --> 00:40:43,087
What?
- Yes baby.

747
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:47,567
Oh my God.
That is so cool.

748
00:40:48,087 --> 00:40:49,687
No, no..

749
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:51,287
Yes baby.
- No..

750
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,167
Yes..
- Go and do your work.

751
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:53,607
Go and get started.
Come on.

752
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:56,567
This is my work.
- Come on.

753
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:58,407
No, this is not your work.
That is your work, go.

754
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:00,207
Okay let me make a drink then.
- Okay.

755
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:04,447
I will have to be punished
for falling in love.

756
00:41:45,157 --> 00:41:45,987
What is this?

757
00:41:45,987 --> 00:41:49,557
Madam, I have a rule and that..
What is this?

758
00:41:49,557 --> 00:41:50,427
Madam, I have a rule and that..

759
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:53,547
..is I sell only female
things on my cart.

760
00:41:54,407 --> 00:41:56,647
That is why fish with lady finger.

761
00:41:56,727 --> 00:42:00,367
And colocasia with fish
and gourd with colocasia.

762
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:01,927
Do you want to say something else?

763
00:42:02,007 --> 00:42:04,807
It will help in the
making of the video. Stupid.

764
00:42:05,007 --> 00:42:06,887
What a coincidence madam.

765
00:42:07,447 --> 00:42:12,247
The vegetables of my cart are
green and your dress is also green.

766
00:42:12,487 --> 00:42:15,167
And I have become
excited on seeing you.

767
00:42:15,247 --> 00:42:16,687
Shut up. Shut up.

768
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:20,127
The shoot has still
not started so be normal.

769
00:42:20,607 --> 00:42:24,047
Uncle, you are getting too excited.
- One minute, one minute..

770
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,047
We are not sitting
in neighboring country.

771
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,807
India should be seen. India..

772
00:42:28,657 --> 00:42:31,457
Rolling..3, 2, 1..action.

773
00:42:31,577 --> 00:42:34,337
At this time I am in
the vegetable market of Dongri.

774
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:37,417
Aslam uncle puts the biggest
cart of vegetables here.

775
00:42:37,537 --> 00:42:38,617
He is with us.

776
00:42:38,777 --> 00:42:40,657
Today he is put up a small cart.

777
00:42:41,097 --> 00:42:44,857
Aslam uncle, shall we start if
the fishes have gained consciousness.

778
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,697
Yes sir.

779
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,137
We have heard that
famous underworld don D..

780
00:42:49,217 --> 00:42:50,777
..used to buy vegetables from here.

781
00:42:50,857 --> 00:42:51,977
Is this true?

782
00:42:52,297 --> 00:42:57,217
But it. That rascal used
to never buy but take them for free.

783
00:42:57,537 --> 00:43:02,257
So you mean to say such a great
underworld don D was a vegetable thief.

784
00:43:02,737 --> 00:43:04,417
Which vegetables he used to steal?

785
00:43:04,537 --> 00:43:10,457
I have a cart of 55 vegetables
but D always used to take spinach.

786
00:43:10,537 --> 00:43:13,257
Oh! You want to say that
he was into green veggies.

787
00:43:13,337 --> 00:43:15,857
No sir, green veggies were into D.

788
00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:17,537
So you can speak Hindi Urdu.

789
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:21,057
Absolutely.
I mean he had a problem of piles.

790
00:43:21,137 --> 00:43:23,017
You mean to say piles.

791
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:27,457
By changing words the
problem will not subside.

792
00:43:27,577 --> 00:43:30,657
So by eating spinach piles are cured.

793
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:33,697
Not by eating sir but by applying.

794
00:43:34,537 --> 00:43:39,457
As you saw Aslam uncle
said that for D it was..

795
00:43:39,577 --> 00:43:44,217
..less of vegetable shop
and more of medical store.

796
00:43:44,297 --> 00:43:48,577
To send your response
tweet

797
00:43:51,457 --> 00:43:52,977
How much over acting do you do?

798
00:43:53,857 --> 00:43:54,537
Let's go.

799
00:43:57,457 --> 00:44:00,977
Sir, do you wish to say something
to Arnab about his media stand.

800
00:44:01,817 --> 00:44:04,537
He definitely ahs some
connection with that D.

801
00:44:04,617 --> 00:44:06,937
It is a game which they
both together are playing with me.

802
00:44:07,017 --> 00:44:10,977
Sir, it is quite daring that
a reporter has openly challenged D.

803
00:44:11,137 --> 00:44:13,297
Do you want to say something about it?

804
00:44:13,377 --> 00:44:15,097
Please stay away. I don't
want to say anything about this.

805
00:44:15,177 --> 00:44:18,017
Sir, Arnab insulted you so much and
still you do not want to say anything.

806
00:44:18,097 --> 00:44:19,577
I said leave my way.

807
00:44:19,617 --> 00:44:21,577
Please give me the answer, sir.
- Nonsense.

808
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,577
You are an inspector so sit straight.

809
00:44:42,617 --> 00:44:44,097
Let me set your moustaches.

810
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,057
Madam..
- What?

811
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:50,057
I swear upon my mother..
- What?

812
00:44:50,137 --> 00:44:56,257
I mean I swear upon my mother that when
you touch my cheeks I seem to melt.

813
00:44:56,337 --> 00:44:58,377
-Shut up.
-Come on let's start.

814
00:44:59,257 --> 00:45:00,017
Are you ready?

815
00:45:00,897 --> 00:45:02,137
Okay let's go.

816
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:08,057
At this time I am outside Nagpada
police station and we have with us..

817
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:10,737
..senior constable Dougle.
Come let us talk to him.

818
00:45:10,817 --> 00:45:13,217
Mr. Dougle we have heard
that D has spent many..

819
00:45:13,897 --> 00:45:16,177
..days in this police
station when he was young.

820
00:45:16,257 --> 00:45:18,777
Not when he was young but he used
to come here even in his childhood.

821
00:45:18,857 --> 00:45:20,857
Sometimes he used
to puncture the cycle..

822
00:45:20,937 --> 00:45:22,657
..or sometimes break
the lock of the neighbors.

823
00:45:22,737 --> 00:45:24,937
I swear he was a very
different kind of a person.

824
00:45:25,017 --> 00:45:27,977
So you mean to say that D
has spent a lot of time in this jail.

825
00:45:28,057 --> 00:45:29,897
Not only in jail but he has spent..

826
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,777
..a lot of time in
the 4*4 room next to that.

827
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:32,977
What happens there?

828
00:45:33,137 --> 00:45:36,737
We try to improve new and
spoilt brats there with love.

829
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,777
Okay, so that means you
have thrashed D many times.

830
00:45:38,857 --> 00:45:41,657
One time I let him go.

831
00:45:41,857 --> 00:45:44,337
I thrashed him badly.
- Okay.

832
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:46,737
One day his father
brought him here to me.

833
00:45:46,817 --> 00:45:48,097
Okay. Tell us more.

834
00:45:48,817 --> 00:45:52,217
Rest all is fine. Wife is unwell.

835
00:45:52,297 --> 00:45:54,377
Younger has failed in 10th std.

836
00:45:54,457 --> 00:45:55,857
Rest all is well.

837
00:45:55,937 --> 00:45:57,937
Tell about that girl. Stop overacting.

838
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,257
Yes..
- Yes tell..

839
00:45:59,337 --> 00:46:02,977
I remember he was brought
here once for teasing a girl.

840
00:46:03,057 --> 00:46:04,177
So D had teased a girl.

841
00:46:04,257 --> 00:46:06,137
He did not tease but tried to.

842
00:46:06,217 --> 00:46:11,617
The girl also thrashed him
and brought her to police station.

843
00:46:11,697 --> 00:46:13,537
That day I felt pity on him.

844
00:46:13,617 --> 00:46:15,097
I did not feel like thrashing him.

845
00:46:15,177 --> 00:46:16,697
So you did not thrash D.

846
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:19,897
No sir. That day I came
here after fighting with wife.

847
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:20,577
Yes.

848
00:46:20,617 --> 00:46:23,897
Does anyone put garlic in
potato and cauliflower vegetable?

849
00:46:23,977 --> 00:46:24,697
Does anyone put?

850
00:46:25,257 --> 00:46:27,417
No. My mood was very bad.

851
00:46:27,777 --> 00:46:28,617
I slapped..

852
00:46:28,697 --> 00:46:29,297
Your wife.

853
00:46:29,377 --> 00:46:32,337
I dare not slap my wife.
But I slapped D.

854
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:33,777
Okay.
- Yes..

855
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:37,017
That day I really felt
like thrashing him hard.

856
00:46:37,097 --> 00:46:38,937
I missed one and
hit him under the eye.

857
00:46:39,017 --> 00:46:39,537
Oh.

858
00:46:39,577 --> 00:46:43,457
He wears the glasses to
hide the mark given by my hand.

859
00:46:43,537 --> 00:46:45,377
Many people do not know about it.

860
00:46:45,457 --> 00:46:48,537
You just heard what Dougle said.

861
00:46:48,617 --> 00:46:54,417
The mark of what he gave
D under the eye still remains.

862
00:46:54,537 --> 00:46:57,177
The question is that mark still there.

863
00:46:57,257 --> 00:47:01,697
Tweet your response
at

864
00:47:15,697 --> 00:47:18,057
Brother..
- Yes, tell me.

865
00:47:18,577 --> 00:47:20,057
How shall I speak? I am feeling shy.

866
00:47:21,937 --> 00:47:25,777
What is the matter?
Have you got vasectomy done?

867
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:28,897
No, no what are you
talking brother. Oh no..

868
00:47:29,897 --> 00:47:31,217
Oh God....

869
00:47:33,177 --> 00:47:37,217
A chaos about you
is there on social media.

870
00:47:37,577 --> 00:47:38,577
About what?

871
00:47:40,297 --> 00:47:43,417
The video about you.

872
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:50,057
There is a vegetable seller
who says that you stole his vegetable.

873
00:47:50,137 --> 00:47:53,857
There is a policeman who says that..

874
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:56,817
Don't be poetic. Tell me clearly.

875
00:47:56,897 --> 00:48:01,377
Policeman is saying that
he had thrashed you hard.

876
00:48:01,457 --> 00:48:04,817
That constable is saying so.

877
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:07,417
Show me the video.

878
00:48:07,537 --> 00:48:08,537
No, no..

879
00:48:08,737 --> 00:48:11,057
Show it to me.
- No..

880
00:48:13,577 --> 00:48:16,657
What is this?
This seems to be ammunition shop.

881
00:48:17,377 --> 00:48:19,417
This is new one.
Even I had not seen this.

882
00:48:19,537 --> 00:48:22,457
At this moment I am with Mr.
Zuber proprietor of Zuber arms.

883
00:48:22,897 --> 00:48:24,777
Mr. Zuber I am with you.

884
00:48:24,857 --> 00:48:25,777
Tell me.

885
00:48:25,857 --> 00:48:28,297
Did D buy the gun for
the first time from you?

886
00:48:28,777 --> 00:48:32,977
Yes sir, we needed
gun oil to repair the guns.

887
00:48:33,057 --> 00:48:35,297
The picture as well as sound is good.
- he used to supply.

888
00:48:35,377 --> 00:48:35,977
What?

889
00:48:36,177 --> 00:48:37,417
He used to supply.

890
00:48:37,537 --> 00:48:41,377
He used to supply. So how long did
this association with him continued?

891
00:48:41,537 --> 00:48:45,217
It could not continue for long
but the matter is that he used to..

892
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:49,537
..steal oil from Mahalaxmi
godown and sell us at cheaper rate.

893
00:48:49,937 --> 00:48:52,057
This must have continued
for 2-3 months..

894
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,537
..and then what could have happened.

895
00:48:53,657 --> 00:48:56,217
Mr. Dougle came and arrested him.

896
00:48:56,297 --> 00:48:56,777
Okay.

897
00:48:56,857 --> 00:48:59,617
He thrashed him so hard that after..

898
00:48:59,697 --> 00:49:01,377
..that he was hardly
seen once or twice around.

899
00:49:01,457 --> 00:49:04,617
What did you talk with him
whenever you saw him once or twice?

900
00:49:04,897 --> 00:49:08,777
Just tell me that does
a man speak who is injured?

901
00:49:09,137 --> 00:49:14,017
He wanted to speak a lot but
could not speak with swollen lips.

902
00:49:14,337 --> 00:49:15,057
Did he speak?

903
00:49:15,217 --> 00:49:16,617
No, he could not speak.
- Okay.

904
00:49:16,857 --> 00:49:21,417
All he could say was that he
will not be able to do this business.

905
00:49:21,537 --> 00:49:21,977
Okay.

906
00:49:23,777 --> 00:49:26,137
When did he but the
first gun from you?

907
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:29,417
1989. he came here with two friends.

908
00:49:29,577 --> 00:49:31,537
He came here to buy three
hand guns and two pistols.

909
00:49:31,617 --> 00:49:34,537
What would have been the
cost of 3 hand guns and 2 pistols?

910
00:49:34,857 --> 00:49:36,417
There was no sale.

911
00:49:36,697 --> 00:49:42,137
There is a ground behind
our godown where guns are tested.

912
00:49:42,217 --> 00:49:44,737
I took him there to get the test done.

913
00:49:44,897 --> 00:49:48,577
Believe it or not but it seemed
as if he knew nothing about it.

914
00:49:48,737 --> 00:49:51,537
He did not know
anything about the gun.

915
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:53,137
Even then he was adamant to shoot.

916
00:49:53,217 --> 00:49:55,937
I asked him to shoot
as even I had to make sale.

917
00:49:56,177 --> 00:49:59,617
Then he picked up the
gun and started shooting..

918
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:00,057
Yes..

919
00:50:00,137 --> 00:50:02,137
..and because of the weight
of the gun the wrist got twisted.

920
00:50:02,217 --> 00:50:04,337
And did not hit the aim.
- The aim had to miss.

921
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:05,617
Absolutely right, sir.

922
00:50:05,697 --> 00:50:08,897
But he aimed at the
ceiling of nearby shop.

923
00:50:08,977 --> 00:50:10,937
The ceiling fell
and three workers died.

924
00:50:11,537 --> 00:50:14,737
Against his will D
committed his first murder.

925
00:50:14,817 --> 00:50:16,337
Okay then what happened?

926
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:20,297
Then I asked him to
leave before any more died.

927
00:50:20,377 --> 00:50:23,737
Then Mr. Dougle came and took him.

928
00:50:24,057 --> 00:50:25,897
Then..

929
00:50:26,177 --> 00:50:29,417
In this way D committed
his first murder.

930
00:50:29,537 --> 00:50:32,697
To give your response tweet..

931
00:50:32,777 --> 00:50:37,217
..

932
00:50:40,057 --> 00:50:41,097
Who is he?

933
00:50:49,737 --> 00:50:51,857
Find out Girdhari.
- Okay.

934
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:53,697
I will not spare him.

935
00:50:53,777 --> 00:50:55,857
Be careful brother.
Your BP will shoot.

936
00:50:56,177 --> 00:50:58,457
Find out. Find out..

937
00:50:58,537 --> 00:50:59,577
Okay.

938
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,017
Brother that..

939
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:05,217
What?

940
00:51:05,537 --> 00:51:06,937
There are two more videos.

941
00:51:21,777 --> 00:51:23,097
Why are you laughing?

942
00:51:23,177 --> 00:51:25,057
Because you were laughing brother.

943
00:51:35,297 --> 00:51:36,897
Hello..
- Hello.

944
00:51:37,937 --> 00:51:45,057
Before doing the daring you
should have thought about the dangers.

945
00:51:45,217 --> 00:51:46,137
Who is speaking?

946
00:51:46,217 --> 00:51:47,857
Since three days you
have created a chaos on..

947
00:51:47,937 --> 00:51:50,457
..twitter and you do
not know who I am speaking.

948
00:51:50,657 --> 00:51:51,297
D.

949
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,737
Will D personally call you?

950
00:51:53,817 --> 00:51:54,697
So who is speaking?

951
00:51:54,777 --> 00:51:57,017
It is not important who I am speaking.

952
00:51:57,097 --> 00:52:01,577
It is important that
you stop your drama.

953
00:52:02,297 --> 00:52:05,537
Otherwise we will not
take much time to finish you.

954
00:52:05,617 --> 00:52:07,177
This drama will not stop.

955
00:52:08,017 --> 00:52:09,017
India is a free country
and we have the..

956
00:52:09,097 --> 00:52:10,617
..right to speak and
show anything we wish to.

957
00:52:10,697 --> 00:52:12,337
Hey, free country.

958
00:52:12,857 --> 00:52:14,657
Keep a finger on the globe.

959
00:52:15,057 --> 00:52:18,017
Every country is there
but none is free for us.

960
00:52:18,857 --> 00:52:20,897
Whatever you are showing
is false so stop it.

961
00:52:20,977 --> 00:52:22,177
What is wrong in that?

962
00:52:22,257 --> 00:52:24,337
If you believe vegetable seller
and constable then everything is true.

963
00:52:24,417 --> 00:52:27,577
Understand that you
and your actors will die.

964
00:52:27,737 --> 00:52:29,937
You do not understand.
This drama will not end.

965
00:52:31,217 --> 00:52:32,977
Kill me if you wish to.

966
00:52:33,057 --> 00:52:34,937
What will you achieve by killing me.

967
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:40,217
Look, if one incident happens on social
media then its impact is for long.

968
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:43,537
Your brother is going
to be insulted for sure.

969
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,977
Yes, there is one option.

970
00:52:45,297 --> 00:52:47,817
Quiet. Are you playing KBC with me?

971
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:50,377
Ask brother to give
me personal interview.

972
00:52:50,777 --> 00:52:52,817
Whatever he wishes to
justify say in that interview.

973
00:52:52,897 --> 00:52:55,777
I take the responsibility
of telecasting that interview.

974
00:52:55,897 --> 00:52:56,457
Okay..

975
00:52:56,577 --> 00:52:59,617
Hey you rascal..

976
00:52:59,697 --> 00:53:01,337
Don't curse me but do me this favor.

977
00:53:01,977 --> 00:53:05,937
Now call me next time only when
brother agrees for interview. Okay.

978
00:53:06,177 --> 00:53:07,217
Hey hello..

979
00:53:23,257 --> 00:53:27,537
So he has created all
this chaos for the interview.

980
00:53:27,817 --> 00:53:28,657
Yes brother.

981
00:53:31,257 --> 00:53:32,217
Say yes.

982
00:53:32,737 --> 00:53:34,417
What are you saying?

983
00:53:34,537 --> 00:53:35,937
Say yes to him.
How?

984
00:53:37,137 --> 00:53:40,857
It is an opportunity Girdhari.
Enough of playing jokes.

985
00:53:42,777 --> 00:53:45,177
Those who were scared till
yesterday are laughing today.

986
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:54,697
Everyone should know
that D means fear.

987
00:53:55,017 --> 00:53:57,737
That means D you will
give interview and come on TV.

988
00:53:57,857 --> 00:54:00,057
Bringing him here
would create trouble.

989
00:54:00,217 --> 00:54:01,697
There is a security risk.

990
00:54:01,777 --> 00:54:04,217
There is no security risk Girdhari.

991
00:54:06,417 --> 00:54:08,937
He has just to be brought here.

992
00:54:09,297 --> 00:54:10,577
What do you mean?

993
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:15,337
I mean you say yes
to him for the interview..

994
00:54:17,057 --> 00:54:20,297
..and I will kill him live on TV.

995
00:54:34,097 --> 00:54:34,817
Hello..

996
00:54:35,257 --> 00:54:37,657

3:30 at Bhendi Bazaar.

997
00:54:37,737 --> 00:54:38,657
Come alone.

998
00:54:39,457 --> 00:54:40,537
Who is speaking?

999
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:43,297
If you need interview
then reach there.

1000
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,297

Bhendi Bazaar. Can't you hear?

1003
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,977
Okay, Bhendi Bazaar.
But where in Bhendi Bazaar?

1004
00:54:52,137 --> 00:54:54,537
Ask for 100gms cardamom
at Simar general store.

1005
00:54:54,777 --> 00:54:55,577
200gms.

1006
00:54:55,657 --> 00:54:58,297
100gms cardamom.
- Okay.

1007
00:54:59,017 --> 00:55:00,057

1008
00:55:00,137 --> 00:55:01,937
Yes, Bhendi Bazaar.
- Okay.

1009
00:55:13,737 --> 00:55:18,577
Roy, my boy we are in cardamom!

1010
00:55:19,217 --> 00:55:21,337
I mean we are in business.

1011
00:55:22,337 --> 00:55:23,137
Yes.

1012
00:55:45,937 --> 00:55:48,337
I hope you had no problem
in understanding the route. - No..

1013
00:55:48,617 --> 00:55:50,737
Look at this cardamom.

1014
00:55:50,817 --> 00:55:52,777
I had called for it.

1015
00:55:53,057 --> 00:55:54,577
It was finished at home.

1016
00:55:54,657 --> 00:55:56,537
It will be of use
to make rice pudding.

1017
00:55:56,577 --> 00:55:59,857
You just have to take 4 people there.

1018
00:55:59,937 --> 00:56:01,297
Tell me before hand.

1019
00:56:01,377 --> 00:56:03,057
Take this.
- What is this?

1020
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:07,777
These are your tickets. Do
not open them before reaching there.

1021
00:56:07,857 --> 00:56:10,337
You must have understood
that Haftaa brother has sent this.

1022
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:11,737
But how will we go?

1023
00:56:11,817 --> 00:56:14,977
There is a Bahid village
near Bikaner in Rajasthan.

1024
00:56:15,057 --> 00:56:18,457
Reach there at 4 in the afternoon
there day after tomorrow.

1025
00:56:18,577 --> 00:56:21,857
Near kali Mata Chowk
you will find a tea stall.

1026
00:56:21,937 --> 00:56:25,017
Order for Udta Chicken
and Bullet Chaat.

1027
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:27,457
Brother, give me 4 Udta Chicken chaat.

1028
00:56:27,737 --> 00:56:29,057
Coffee With D

1029
00:56:32,537 --> 00:56:36,777
If you want to live
then drink coffee with D

1030
00:56:39,577 --> 00:56:44,057
If you want to live
then drink coffee with D

1031
00:56:57,697 --> 00:57:00,897
Brother we got message
of Hafta brother.

1032
00:57:01,457 --> 00:57:02,697
The boys are right.

1033
00:57:02,777 --> 00:57:05,617
Won't you blindfold us
so that we cannot see the way?

1034
00:57:05,857 --> 00:57:07,577
There is no problem if you see..

1035
00:57:07,617 --> 00:57:09,417
..because you will not
be able to see while returning.

1036
00:57:09,537 --> 00:57:10,217
Why?

1037
00:57:10,297 --> 00:57:12,257
Because while returning
you will be in chicken bag.

1038
00:57:13,177 --> 00:57:15,097
Coffee With D.

1039
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:28,697
Okay, who is Arnab?

1040
00:57:28,977 --> 00:57:31,097
Okay, okay.

1041
00:57:31,177 --> 00:57:34,897
Hey, what are you selling nowadays,
vegetable seller?

1042
00:57:34,977 --> 00:57:37,657
I don't have a shop.
I am a makeup man sir.

1043
00:57:37,737 --> 00:57:39,017
Okay, keep quiet vegetable seller.

1044
00:57:39,097 --> 00:57:41,177
Hey madam, no photo.
- Why?

1045
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:42,137
Keep your mobile inside.

1046
00:57:43,057 --> 00:57:45,697
No photo.
- Sorry.

1047
00:57:45,777 --> 00:57:47,457
You seemed to be very brave
on the phone the other day.

1048
00:57:47,537 --> 00:57:49,337
I felt as if you would
kill me there and then.

1049
00:57:49,417 --> 00:57:51,457
Today you seemed to be tensed.

1050
00:57:52,137 --> 00:57:55,537
I had to reach you otherwise I
am worth nothing in front of you all.

1051
00:57:55,617 --> 00:57:56,377
What do you mean?

1052
00:57:56,697 --> 00:57:59,977
I mean will D sir
meet us now or later?

1053
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:01,297
He will meet you later.

1054
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:03,257
Is she your wife?
- No.

1055
00:58:03,937 --> 00:58:06,177
Is she your sister?
- No.

1056
00:58:07,537 --> 00:58:09,457
I am Girdhari.

1057
00:58:11,657 --> 00:58:13,617
Either shake hands or give me the bag.

1058
00:58:15,057 --> 00:58:16,377

Ask her to pick up.

1079
00:59:06,017 --> 00:59:08,017
Come on get inside.
- Come on.

1080
00:59:08,097 --> 00:59:10,537
Come on.

1081
00:59:19,577 --> 00:59:20,177
Hello.

1082
00:59:20,577 --> 00:59:23,337
You should have been
director in CBI Mr. Roy.

1083
00:59:23,537 --> 00:59:24,537
Who is this?

1084
00:59:24,577 --> 00:59:26,697
I am director of CBI speaking fool.

1085
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,657
Is there some legal matter that
you have sent your people to Pakistan?

1086
00:59:29,737 --> 00:59:32,457
Sorry sir. I made a mistake.

1087
00:59:32,577 --> 00:59:35,457
I was about to call
you and then I realized..

1088
00:59:35,537 --> 00:59:37,977
..that you will talk that nonsense.

1089
00:59:38,217 --> 00:59:40,297
Get the phone of D tapped.

1090
00:59:40,537 --> 00:59:43,057
Or send some of his internal photos.

1091
00:59:43,857 --> 00:59:45,337
Or give him posion.

1092
00:59:45,657 --> 00:59:48,097
My boy would have got
distracted from his work, sir.

1093
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:50,777
You do not know what
foolishness have you done.

1094
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:56,297
Sir if we do the work that you cannot
do then it is called foolishness.

1095
00:59:56,377 --> 00:59:57,377
This is wrong, sir.

1096
00:59:57,457 --> 00:59:59,577
You idiot.
Do you know what you have done?

1097
00:59:59,617 --> 01:00:01,057
Because of this..
- I am sorry sir.

1098
01:00:01,137 --> 01:00:02,777
I will have to keep the phone.
There is lots of work here.

1099
01:00:02,857 --> 01:00:05,137
Sir we will talk
at ease some other time.

1100
01:00:05,217 --> 01:00:07,377
Why don't you do one thing?
Come to our studio.

1101
01:00:07,457 --> 01:00:08,857
We will take your interview as well.
- What..

1102
01:00:09,257 --> 01:00:10,897
Okay sir.
- Idiot.

1103
01:00:12,857 --> 01:00:15,017
I know that you are scared.

1104
01:00:15,697 --> 01:00:18,217
Anyways there is nothing
to be scared of as..

1105
01:00:18,297 --> 01:00:20,577
I do not unnecessarily
raise hand on someone.

1106
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,657
Hey, can't you see it is a carpet.

1107
01:00:24,297 --> 01:00:25,697
How dare you bring dirty shoes inside?

1108
01:00:26,017 --> 01:00:30,097
Hey, I think you do
not know whose men are we.

1109
01:00:30,177 --> 01:00:34,097
Idiot, you are the men of that person
who sells cardamom in Bhendi bazaar.

1110
01:00:34,377 --> 01:00:37,577
And my husband has personally gone
to meet the person for whom he works.

1111
01:00:37,657 --> 01:00:39,377
Now you see what is your standing?

1112
01:00:40,777 --> 01:00:42,657
Keep the shoes away and sit down.
- Okay.

1113
01:00:42,737 --> 01:00:44,017
I am saying that..

1114
01:00:44,137 --> 01:00:46,177
First remove your shoes.
- Remove them, remove them..

1115
01:00:46,257 --> 01:00:47,977
Okay, okay..

1116
01:00:50,457 --> 01:00:54,657
Hey beautiful,
you are taking us too lightly.

1117
01:00:54,857 --> 01:00:56,697
Do you know what is this?
- It is a shoe.

1118
01:01:00,177 --> 01:01:03,657
Brother, gun.
Since long we were playing with knife.

1119
01:01:03,737 --> 01:01:08,977
Keep it straight.
- Do you know this is real gun?

1120
01:01:09,537 --> 01:01:12,457
Keep it on the side
otherwise you may shoot.

1121
01:01:12,617 --> 01:01:14,457
Why?

1122
01:01:14,617 --> 01:01:17,137
If you shoot then
this bulb will burst.

1123
01:01:17,457 --> 01:01:20,537
And if I shoot then God forbid even
I don't know what will happen of you.

1124
01:01:21,857 --> 01:01:25,537
I think I will have to
take permission to kill you.

1125
01:01:28,417 --> 01:01:30,057
Is it correct?
- It is correct.

1126
01:01:30,417 --> 01:01:32,337
Hello.
- Tell me.

1127
01:01:32,817 --> 01:01:34,697
What kind of female is she?

1128
01:01:34,777 --> 01:01:37,657
She is saying that she
will kill me with my gun.

1129
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:39,257
Make her understand who I am?

1130
01:01:39,337 --> 01:01:40,417
Who I am?

1131
01:01:40,537 --> 01:01:42,217
Who I am?

1132
01:01:42,297 --> 01:01:43,337
Who I am?

1133
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:44,617
Tell me who I am?

1134
01:01:45,057 --> 01:01:48,417
Don't mess up. You just have
to keep a watch and nothing else.

1135
01:01:48,737 --> 01:01:51,817
Okay, good that we talked to you.

1136
01:01:51,897 --> 01:01:55,577
Otherwise you know that
if would have got angry..

1137
01:01:55,617 --> 01:01:58,577
..this woman must have died by now.

1138
01:01:58,617 --> 01:02:01,257
Surely.
- Ameen.

1139
01:02:01,337 --> 01:02:05,857
Forget it. You cannot kill a
mosquito and you are talking so great.

1140
01:02:06,057 --> 01:02:08,297
Just keep a watch quietly
and for god sake..

1141
01:02:08,377 --> 01:02:10,097
..don't get insulted anymore.
- He is praising me.

1142
01:02:10,177 --> 01:02:11,537
Keep quiet.

1143
01:02:11,617 --> 01:02:14,617
Brother, listen to me.
- I don't want to hear anything.

1144
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:16,857
Hey Afshaab.
-Yes.

1145
01:02:17,217 --> 01:02:19,737
Make them understand.
They are creating too much problem.

1146
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:21,977
They do not know basic hygiene.

1147
01:02:22,177 --> 01:02:24,577
He came with dirty
shoes on the carpet.

1148
01:02:24,857 --> 01:02:27,057
And the other one has
spread the smell of tobacco..

1149
01:02:27,137 --> 01:02:28,857
..which he is chewing continuously.

1150
01:02:28,937 --> 01:02:31,137
He eats a lot of tobacco.

1151
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:32,777
So make him understand.

1152
01:02:33,937 --> 01:02:37,137
Is this the way to behave
in the house of sophisticated people?

1153
01:02:37,977 --> 01:02:41,897
One thing more. Tell then
not do any drama in front of me.

1154
01:02:41,977 --> 01:02:44,537
I know they have just
come to keep a watch.

1155
01:02:44,977 --> 01:02:49,057
They have no orders to do anything
nor do they have that status.

1156
01:02:52,257 --> 01:02:55,897
Everyone knows Crime
Patrol Episode 591 Season 2

1157
01:02:55,977 --> 01:02:57,697
Watch it on you tube.
I shall keep the phone.

1158
01:02:58,537 --> 01:02:59,217
Take it.

1159
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:01,537
She sees crime patrol.
- okay, come on.

1160
01:03:09,457 --> 01:03:12,137
I beg of you. Please..

1161
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:17,137
It is matter of my dignity.
Please get scared a bit.

1162
01:03:17,217 --> 01:03:18,857
Let me make a video, please.

1163
01:03:18,937 --> 01:03:20,537
What is there?

1164
01:03:21,017 --> 01:03:22,577
Shall I say something?

1165
01:03:24,457 --> 01:03:26,137
Is it done?
Video..

1166
01:03:27,377 --> 01:03:28,337
Okay do.

1167
01:03:28,777 --> 01:03:30,097
Get scared a bit.

1168
01:03:30,177 --> 01:03:32,017
Arnab I am feeling very scared.

1169
01:03:32,097 --> 01:03:34,777
Arnab, they have kidnapped me.
Please save me Arnab.

1170
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:37,057
Please I am very scared.

1171
01:03:39,097 --> 01:03:44,777
Arnab, they are holding my hand.
Please save me.

1172
01:03:48,777 --> 01:03:50,217
Leave me.

1173
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:53,577
Enough.
- Get lost. Enough of it.

1174
01:04:00,457 --> 01:04:01,657
Brother has made a nice house.

1175
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:03,697
The place where you are standing..

1176
01:04:03,777 --> 01:04:05,257
Is there a bomb there?
- No, no..

1177
01:04:05,337 --> 01:04:08,417
Those are Italian tiles. Imported.

1178
01:04:10,777 --> 01:04:12,217
Is it good?
- Nice.

1179
01:04:13,457 --> 01:04:14,377
Can you see that?

1180
01:04:14,777 --> 01:04:17,697
Brother cut the hand
of the person who made it.

1181
01:04:19,257 --> 01:04:20,057
Why?

1182
01:04:20,617 --> 01:04:22,977
A masterpiece remains a
masterpiece only when one is made.

1183
01:04:23,057 --> 01:04:24,897
Like Shah Jahan.
- Yes.

1184
01:04:26,337 --> 01:04:27,977
Till when will sir do interview?

1185
01:04:28,057 --> 01:04:28,657
Interview?

1186
01:04:28,737 --> 01:04:30,857
Eat something and then
we will do interview.

1187
01:04:30,937 --> 01:04:32,417
What will you have vegetarian
or non vegetarian food.

1188
01:04:32,537 --> 01:04:33,297
Nothing..

1189
01:04:33,377 --> 01:04:34,777
Eat something.

1190
01:04:34,857 --> 01:04:36,057
We had chicken on the way.

1191
01:04:36,377 --> 01:04:37,297
Okay.

1192
01:04:37,377 --> 01:04:43,297
We have a tradition that
before killing the goat we feed him.

1193
01:04:44,537 --> 01:04:45,457
Food.

1194
01:04:48,577 --> 01:04:50,017
How did you like the house?
- Nice.

1195
01:04:50,097 --> 01:04:51,657
Is it nice?

1196
01:04:52,457 --> 01:04:55,697
The house in which you live
in Mumbai is rented or your own.

1197
01:04:55,777 --> 01:04:56,577
It is on EMI

1198
01:04:57,617 --> 01:04:59,297
That house is also nice.

1199
01:04:59,777 --> 01:05:00,857
Curtains are also nice.

1200
01:05:02,017 --> 01:05:04,697
Sister-in-law is also beautiful.

1201
01:05:05,617 --> 01:05:09,257
You are very fond of making
comedy videos and showing them.

1202
01:05:09,337 --> 01:05:12,337
Watch a thriller now.
- Arnab, he is holding my hand.

1203
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:13,897
Please save me..

1204
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,617
Don't do this. What are you doing?

1205
01:05:16,697 --> 01:05:17,457
Leave me.

1206
01:05:17,537 --> 01:05:20,297
Nothing will happen. Don't worry
nothing will happen to sister-in-law.

1207
01:05:20,377 --> 01:05:22,097
This is just a teaser.

1208
01:05:22,977 --> 01:05:24,537
This is for the simple
reason that you do not..

1209
01:05:24,617 --> 01:05:27,097
..misbehave while taking
interview with brother.

1210
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:31,937
Otherwise we will get sequel 1,
2, 3 of it.

1211
01:05:32,297 --> 01:05:35,817
Nothing will happen to her.
This is just for reference.

1212
01:05:37,577 --> 01:05:38,537
Where is he?

1213
01:05:39,177 --> 01:05:41,457
Rumy. There he is.

1214
01:05:41,817 --> 01:05:43,297
Okay..
- Where is..

1215
01:05:43,657 --> 01:05:45,297
Bathroom. This side.

1216
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:50,297
Come, will you have tea?

1217
01:05:50,377 --> 01:05:52,097
Yes, I am very fond of tea.

1218
01:05:52,177 --> 01:05:55,017
Make me drink nice tea.
- Tanveer, get tasty tea.

1219
01:05:55,977 --> 01:05:58,137
And how am I looking?

1220
01:05:58,217 --> 01:05:59,377
You are looking very nice.

1221
01:05:59,457 --> 01:06:02,137
Do little bit of what you do.
- Makeup.

1222
01:06:02,217 --> 01:06:02,897
Yes.

1223
01:06:03,217 --> 01:06:05,897
So will you also go
on air for the interview?

1224
01:06:05,977 --> 01:06:07,257
On air.

1225
01:06:07,417 --> 01:06:09,417
That means brother
will go on air as well.

1226
01:06:09,657 --> 01:06:12,137
No, through satellite direct on TV.

1227
01:06:12,217 --> 01:06:15,417
Yes, yes I will come.
Call that cameraman.

1228
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:17,177
Choosy, come here.

1229
01:06:17,857 --> 01:06:19,017
Yes tell me.
- Come here.

1230
01:06:19,097 --> 01:06:20,537
Am I looking okay?
- Nice, absolutely nice.

1231
01:06:20,617 --> 01:06:21,737
Come this side.

1232
01:06:23,177 --> 01:06:25,897
I am cracking jokes
so shoot that in camera.

1233
01:06:25,977 --> 01:06:27,537
Record.
- Yes.

1234
01:06:28,057 --> 01:06:28,737
Shall I speak?

1235
01:06:29,017 --> 01:06:29,857
Yes speak.

1236
01:06:29,977 --> 01:06:31,217
There was a man..

1237
01:06:32,137 --> 01:06:34,737
..who was taking his
newlywed wife on a horse cart.

1238
01:06:34,817 --> 01:06:35,897
Okay.
- Yes.

1239
01:06:36,257 --> 01:06:39,017
A stone came under
the foot of the horse..

1240
01:06:39,217 --> 01:06:41,817
..and he shook with jerk.

1241
01:06:42,297 --> 01:06:43,657
The wife also got jerk.

1242
01:06:43,857 --> 01:06:45,697
The man said one.
- Yes.

1243
01:06:46,137 --> 01:06:48,257
After some time the
horse again got a jerk.

1244
01:06:48,417 --> 01:06:51,697
The wife shook and the man said two.
- Two.

1245
01:06:51,777 --> 01:06:54,457
They went a little ahead.
The same stone and jerk.

1246
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:58,097
The man took out the
gun and shot at the horse.

1247
01:06:58,177 --> 01:07:02,137
The wife shouted that
how merciless you are.

1248
01:07:02,217 --> 01:07:04,377
Does anyone kill an
innocent animal in this way?

1249
01:07:04,577 --> 01:07:05,777
The man said one.

1250
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:09,297
How was it?

1251
01:07:09,617 --> 01:07:11,337
Nice, nice..
- Then laugh.

1252
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:13,737
Nice..
- Now show how it has come.

1253
01:07:14,777 --> 01:07:15,657
Look brother.

1254
01:07:16,257 --> 01:07:18,617
It has come nice.
Nice. Now do that to it.

1255
01:07:18,857 --> 01:07:20,617
Delete..
- No..

1256
01:07:21,177 --> 01:07:21,937
Photohop..

1257
01:07:22,137 --> 01:07:23,217
Upload.

1258
01:07:23,297 --> 01:07:25,457
What do you do as you
did of brother's video?

1259
01:07:25,537 --> 01:07:28,137
Okay, upload it on facebook.
- Yes.

1260
01:07:28,217 --> 01:07:30,457
Yes, do that.
- Okay upload it on facebook.

1261
01:07:30,537 --> 01:07:31,937
Make an infection of it.

1262
01:07:32,017 --> 01:07:35,017
It is not a viral or mosquito
that I make infection of it.

1263
01:07:35,097 --> 01:07:37,297
How did you spread
the video of brother?

1264
01:07:37,377 --> 01:07:38,537
Okay Viral..

1265
01:07:38,577 --> 01:07:40,417
Yes, that.. now make it viral..

1266
01:07:40,537 --> 01:07:42,657
Yes..
- Okay we will do it.

1267
01:07:44,177 --> 01:07:45,097
Neha.

1268
01:07:45,457 --> 01:07:47,737
I just cracked a joke so listen to it.

1269
01:07:48,057 --> 01:07:49,697
Thanks but no thanks.

1270
01:07:49,977 --> 01:07:52,257
It is nice and you will enjoy it.

1271
01:07:52,337 --> 01:07:54,777
No, I don't listen much to jokes.

1272
01:07:54,857 --> 01:07:56,257
Then shall I narrate
something serious?

1273
01:07:56,817 --> 01:07:58,617
I am okay. Thanks.

1274
01:08:00,697 --> 01:08:02,417
I swear it is very hot.

1275
01:08:02,697 --> 01:08:03,617
What?

1276
01:08:04,017 --> 01:08:04,737
Tea.

1277
01:08:04,817 --> 01:08:05,937
Isn't it?
Yes it is hot.

1278
01:08:06,017 --> 01:08:08,857
Please have tea.
- No, I am okay.

1279
01:08:08,937 --> 01:08:10,057
Really, thank you.

1280
01:08:10,257 --> 01:08:12,137
Come on Rumy, going to be on air.

1281
01:08:12,217 --> 01:08:13,697
Come on.
I am giving you with love.

1282
01:08:13,937 --> 01:08:14,857
Okay please...

1283
01:08:15,177 --> 01:08:15,857
Please take it.

1284
01:08:15,937 --> 01:08:16,697
No thanks.
- Come on.

1285
01:08:32,737 --> 01:08:34,217
"Tell me what should I do?"

1286
01:08:34,537 --> 01:08:38,377
"At the back is fear and
death is standing in front."

1287
01:08:39,857 --> 01:08:41,537
"Tell me what should I do?"

1288
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:45,417
"At the back is fear and
death is standing in front."

1289
01:08:46,537 --> 01:08:49,297
Hey Sarwa, just because
of an interview with hooligan..

1290
01:08:49,377 --> 01:08:51,097
..the entire society
has become chaotic.

1291
01:08:51,177 --> 01:08:53,017
Sarwa, he is sitting in Karachi..

1292
01:08:53,097 --> 01:08:57,017
..and here in Mumbai because
of his name he has created confusion.

1293
01:08:57,097 --> 01:08:58,457
Look, how people are running.

1294
01:08:58,537 --> 01:09:02,017
Hey, don't call him a hooligan.
Call him Don.

1295
01:09:02,097 --> 01:09:03,337
Call him Don.

1296
01:09:04,577 --> 01:09:08,977
"If you have the courage
to live then drink Coffee With D."

1297
01:09:11,737 --> 01:09:15,737
"If you have the courage
to live then drink Coffee With D."

1298
01:09:17,657 --> 01:09:19,417
"Coffee With D."

1299
01:09:21,297 --> 01:09:22,817
"Coffee With D."
- You are getting nervous..

1300
01:09:22,897 --> 01:09:25,257
..and you are making me nervous too.
- Just finish this.

1301
01:09:25,337 --> 01:09:26,457
Okay, okay..

1302
01:09:26,817 --> 01:09:28,217
Okay.
- Yeah.

1303
01:09:28,777 --> 01:09:30,217
Okay, let us start.
- Okay.

1304
01:09:30,297 --> 01:09:31,257
Yeah.

1305
01:09:32,977 --> 01:09:35,937
Ready 3, 2..

1306
01:09:36,017 --> 01:09:38,177
One minute..

1307
01:09:38,377 --> 01:09:42,817
Mr. Girdhari, ask brother to
change the shirt. What is he wearing?

1308
01:09:42,897 --> 01:09:44,817
It will create so
much jitter on camera.

1309
01:09:44,897 --> 01:09:45,857
What? Who will kill?

1310
01:09:45,937 --> 01:09:47,417
No, no one minute..

1311
01:09:47,537 --> 01:09:48,977
Will you kill brother?
- No, no..

1312
01:09:49,057 --> 01:09:49,857
He said jitter.

1313
01:09:49,937 --> 01:09:51,537
It is hot outside so
he is becoming irritable.

1314
01:09:51,577 --> 01:09:52,897
Has glitter come to kill him?

1315
01:09:52,977 --> 01:09:56,337
Shirt is absolutely fine.
- Okay.

1316
01:09:56,417 --> 01:09:57,217
Please sit down.

1317
01:09:59,457 --> 01:10:00,937
Quiet.
- What sir?

1318
01:10:01,017 --> 01:10:01,697
Okay.

1319
01:10:03,377 --> 01:10:06,657
Alright going live. 3. 2, 1..

1320
01:10:11,857 --> 01:10:14,937
Welcome and good evening
to One On One with me Arnab Ghosh.

1321
01:10:15,017 --> 01:10:17,417
Today's interview is
special for two reasons.

1322
01:10:17,537 --> 01:10:21,457
One, the person whom I am
going to interview is camera shy.

1323
01:10:21,577 --> 01:10:24,297
He has not given interview
to anyone despite the fact..

1324
01:10:24,537 --> 01:10:27,377
..that he has done such
works that the world's police..

1325
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:31,057
I mean media wants to interview him.

1326
01:10:31,137 --> 01:10:33,137
Secondly it is my birthday..

1327
01:10:33,577 --> 01:10:36,057
..so it might be the
last interview of my life.

1328
01:10:38,537 --> 01:10:39,657
Jokes apart.

1329
01:10:40,017 --> 01:10:42,377
I like to introduce you to the man..

1330
01:10:42,577 --> 01:10:46,337
..the myth and the most
wanted outlaw of the world D.

1331
01:10:51,097 --> 01:10:54,297
So I am giving you interview at last.

1332
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:57,097
At least one of your ill
feelings are taken care of.

1333
01:10:57,177 --> 01:10:59,337
Today you are not giving
interview but I am taking it.

1334
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:24,377
Come on let's start again.

1335
01:11:25,697 --> 01:11:26,697
Greetings Mr. D.

1336
01:11:27,777 --> 01:11:28,937
Greetings.

1337
01:11:29,337 --> 01:11:32,697
Brother..
- Where, where..

1338
01:11:32,777 --> 01:11:33,457
On TV.

1339
01:11:34,097 --> 01:11:37,897
Brother, brother.. worry not.

1340
01:11:37,977 --> 01:11:40,457
I will not spare her. Hey.

1341
01:11:41,537 --> 01:11:44,017
Brother.

1342
01:11:44,577 --> 01:11:50,057
Doesn't your channel have
any news to show other than me?

1343
01:11:50,137 --> 01:11:53,137
We have. But you do such big things.

1344
01:11:53,537 --> 01:11:55,977
You must have seen those videos.
- I have seen..

1345
01:11:56,657 --> 01:11:59,657
..and recognize some of the actors.

1346
01:12:02,137 --> 01:12:05,777
What are you saying Mr. D? Those
are the real videos of real people.

1347
01:12:05,857 --> 01:12:08,257
Don't call me Mr. but brother.
It brings us closer.

1348
01:12:08,817 --> 01:12:11,097
By addressing me Mr.
I get the feel of enmity.

1349
01:12:11,377 --> 01:12:13,777
Anyway your stories are
like drugs to the Indians.

1350
01:12:13,857 --> 01:12:14,817
We can't help it.

1351
01:12:15,017 --> 01:12:19,057
So you mean I should give drug as
well as entertainment brother Arnab.

1352
01:12:19,137 --> 01:12:20,337
Call me Mr. Arnab.

1353
01:12:20,617 --> 01:12:22,377
By calling me brother
I get the feel of hooligan.

1354
01:12:22,897 --> 01:12:26,737
And it is not entertainment.
It is called news.

1355
01:12:27,937 --> 01:12:28,897
Okay.

1356
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:31,417
Brother Girdhari.

1357
01:12:31,577 --> 01:12:33,177
Girdhari, did I hear it correctly?

1358
01:12:33,257 --> 01:12:34,617
Yes, Girdhari.

1359
01:12:34,897 --> 01:12:41,457
Lovingly I call him Girdhari
Secular and he is my main associate.

1360
01:12:41,697 --> 01:12:46,937
In your language he is CEO,
my main man.

1361
01:12:47,017 --> 01:12:49,097
And she is my main lady.

1362
01:12:49,537 --> 01:12:53,937
But Girdhari..
I am surprised that your CEO is a..

1363
01:12:56,297 --> 01:12:57,697
Don't go to that side..

1364
01:12:58,297 --> 01:13:00,297
..otherwise the interview
will become like that..

1365
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:01,737
What do you mean? How will it be?

1366
01:13:01,817 --> 01:13:04,177
Like a nonsense political rally.

1367
01:13:05,017 --> 01:13:08,697
As you wish otherwise honestly
I am interested in going there.

1368
01:13:09,457 --> 01:13:12,737
Girdhari...
- Yes, brother.

1369
01:13:13,697 --> 01:13:17,417
What news did last week come
about me on their news channel?

1370
01:13:17,537 --> 01:13:19,257
Breaking news.

1371
01:13:22,257 --> 01:13:25,337
Brother they had said that for..

1372
01:13:26,297 --> 01:13:30,177
..you have come to Bangkok because
Pakistan does not have this facility.

1373
01:13:30,377 --> 01:13:31,537
Yes.

1374
01:13:31,977 --> 01:13:35,257
Yes. Now tell me brother
Arnab is this right?

1375
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:39,537
For last three months I
have not moved from this place.

1376
01:13:40,257 --> 01:13:41,737
There is nothing great in this.

1377
01:13:41,937 --> 01:13:44,377
That day Pakistan
bashing was necessary.

1378
01:13:44,457 --> 01:13:47,577
Population control guys
wanted to run a story for them.

1379
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:51,217
And more rumors of you being
in Pakistan or not continue.

1380
01:13:51,297 --> 01:13:54,097
Yes so. I did not understand anything.

1381
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:56,697
We had fewer slots.

1382
01:13:56,777 --> 01:13:59,377
So chief editor covered
three stories in single news.

1383
01:13:59,457 --> 01:14:01,057
You must have heard the headlines.

1384
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:04,817
No facility in Pakistan..D
had to go to Bangkok.

1385
01:14:04,897 --> 01:14:05,937
What's wrong with that?

1386
01:14:08,537 --> 01:14:10,937
You should have called
the chief editor as well.

1387
01:14:18,337 --> 01:14:21,097
Brother, may I ask you a question?
- Yes.

1388
01:14:21,817 --> 01:14:24,217
I hope you will let
me go alive from here.

1389
01:14:24,417 --> 01:14:25,457
Do you have any doubt?

1390
01:14:25,537 --> 01:14:28,257
I am sure that you will
not do anything like that.

1391
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:29,977
What will I not do?

1392
01:14:30,057 --> 01:14:31,417
Cheap hooligan acts.

1393
01:14:39,097 --> 01:14:41,617
Brother, firstly I would
like to ask you that..

1394
01:14:41,697 --> 01:14:44,017
..how did you become
such a big gangster?

1395
01:14:44,097 --> 01:14:46,617
You have said it once
so dare not say it again.

1396
01:14:47,537 --> 01:14:49,297
I am not gangster..

1397
01:14:51,897 --> 01:14:53,097
..but a Don.

1398
01:14:54,017 --> 01:14:56,657
What did you understand?
- Okay, what is the difference?

1399
01:14:56,977 --> 01:14:59,897
Have you ever seen shootout on roads?

1400
01:14:59,977 --> 01:15:01,857
Not really but have heard from police.

1401
01:15:02,137 --> 01:15:05,737
Those involved in
shootout are gangsters.

1402
01:15:05,817 --> 01:15:06,897
And don?

1403
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:12,017
Have you ever heard about the
mastermind behind these shootouts?

1404
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:13,697
Not really. Have heard rumors.

1405
01:15:13,777 --> 01:15:19,897
So Don is the mastermind
about whom you have heard rumors.

1406
01:15:20,737 --> 01:15:23,777
So basically how did you become Don?

1407
01:15:29,937 --> 01:15:32,697
Any problem sir.
- No problem.

1408
01:15:33,217 --> 01:15:36,177
Actually I had a desire
of doing business from childhood.

1409
01:15:36,457 --> 01:15:38,217
But business can be of any kind.

1410
01:15:38,297 --> 01:15:41,217
Construction, production,
transportation, real estate etc.

1411
01:15:41,297 --> 01:15:44,177
So what do you think all
these are not my businesses?

1412
01:15:44,257 --> 01:15:46,137
Let's not get involved in what I feel.

1413
01:15:46,217 --> 01:15:48,377
Otherwise this interview
will have pre mature climax.

1414
01:15:48,457 --> 01:15:50,097
Where did you begin from?

1415
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:53,057
Actually I was multi
talented from childhood.

1416
01:15:53,457 --> 01:15:57,057
What is the called? All rounder.

1417
01:15:58,017 --> 01:16:00,577
But my father had problem with this.

1418
01:16:00,657 --> 01:16:02,737
So you mean to say that
the reason you became a Don..

1419
01:16:02,817 --> 01:16:05,377
..are the unresolved father issues.

1420
01:16:06,657 --> 01:16:07,537
What?

1421
01:16:09,137 --> 01:16:11,577
Only one person is responsible..

1422
01:16:11,657 --> 01:16:16,177
..for me to become Don and that is I.

1423
01:16:17,137 --> 01:16:19,337
What did you understand?
- You are right.

1424
01:16:19,577 --> 01:16:21,577
What a stupid question on my part?

1425
01:16:21,657 --> 01:16:24,577
Which father would want his
son to become a Don after growing up?

1426
01:16:24,697 --> 01:16:26,457
Even you are right?

1427
01:16:26,577 --> 01:16:30,577
Which channel would want
his best reporter to die untimely?

1428
01:16:37,857 --> 01:16:39,217
Let's come to your question?

1429
01:16:40,377 --> 01:16:43,737
Actually I loved
cricket from childhood.

1430
01:16:44,817 --> 01:16:47,377
I was short height with
heavy body so could not play.

1431
01:16:47,457 --> 01:16:52,097
But my instincts were very strong.

1432
01:16:52,897 --> 01:16:58,137
In your language 'Mann Ki Baat'

1433
01:16:58,417 --> 01:17:02,977
So from childhood you got
involved in match fixing and betting.

1434
01:17:14,337 --> 01:17:16,737
I said four it was four.

1435
01:17:17,217 --> 01:17:19,217
I said six it was a six.

1436
01:17:19,617 --> 01:17:22,697
I said out it was out.

1437
01:17:23,057 --> 01:17:26,417
So basically you want to say
that your gut feeling was very strong.

1438
01:17:26,537 --> 01:17:27,897
Yes, in the beginning.

1439
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,617
Afterwards there
was no need of gut feel.

1440
01:17:31,617 --> 01:17:32,937
Sorry, I did not understand.

1441
01:17:33,017 --> 01:17:35,817
Ask something else.
Ask something interesting.

1442
01:17:35,897 --> 01:17:39,737
So you are saying that you
have nothing to do with match fixing.

1443
01:17:40,017 --> 01:17:43,257
The entire world knows this D.
you cannot deny this.

1444
01:17:43,337 --> 01:17:45,657
Your photographs
are seen in the stadium.

1445
01:17:45,737 --> 01:17:47,017
How can you say this?

1446
01:17:47,097 --> 01:17:48,777
Photo.
- Yes.

1447
01:17:49,617 --> 01:17:51,817
Photographs are seen
of film stars on grant road..

1448
01:17:51,897 --> 01:17:54,097
..so that means all
of them are prostitutes.

1449
01:17:55,017 --> 01:17:57,937
Photo of politicians is also
there in from Amar Jawan Jyoti..

1450
01:17:58,017 --> 01:17:59,017
..so all of them are patriots.

1451
01:17:59,097 --> 01:18:00,177
What are you talking, brother Arnab?

1452
01:18:00,257 --> 01:18:02,617
So where did all rumors come from?

1453
01:18:02,817 --> 01:18:06,417
Actually I had friendship
with few players.

1454
01:18:06,977 --> 01:18:09,897
Some had difficulty in
affording two girlfriends.

1455
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:11,817
Some had to repay education loan.

1456
01:18:11,897 --> 01:18:13,737
I use to help them.

1457
01:18:13,817 --> 01:18:15,897
Oh I see and in return.

1458
01:18:16,217 --> 01:18:18,817
In return they used to help me.
What else?

1459
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:20,577
Now..

1460
01:18:21,337 --> 01:18:24,897
If every batsman will
make 100 in every match then..

1461
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:27,857
..how will rest of
the talent get a chance?

1462
01:18:28,577 --> 01:18:31,417
Growth should be inclusive.

1463
01:18:31,697 --> 01:18:34,577
That means whatever
we saw on TV screens..

1464
01:18:34,657 --> 01:18:36,537
..was actually remote
controlled by you.

1465
01:18:36,657 --> 01:18:39,737
Hey, you are unnecessarily
exaggerating things.

1466
01:18:42,257 --> 01:18:44,257
So many times..

1467
01:18:44,737 --> 01:18:50,857
..I have told the players
to make 100 in a match.

1468
01:18:50,937 --> 01:18:53,057
For which country?
- My country.

1469
01:18:53,137 --> 01:18:56,537
What do you mean by my country?
- My country means my country.

1470
01:18:56,737 --> 01:18:58,977
That's all very fine
but why don't you take a name?

1471
01:18:59,057 --> 01:19:02,177
What is there in a name,
brother Arnab?

1472
01:19:02,257 --> 01:19:05,097
A country is not made
by name but with people.

1473
01:19:05,177 --> 01:19:06,577
What did you understand?
- Okay.

1474
01:19:06,817 --> 01:19:08,657
So you were talking
about your talents.

1475
01:19:08,817 --> 01:19:09,737
Yes.

1476
01:19:10,057 --> 01:19:12,257
Other than cricket
I loved movies also.

1477
01:19:14,297 --> 01:19:17,057
But I had two weaknesses
with regard to movies.

1478
01:19:18,537 --> 01:19:21,457
One I cannot wait till the
movie is released in cinema halls.

1479
01:19:22,337 --> 01:19:23,697
Secondly..

1480
01:19:25,377 --> 01:19:27,617
..I cannot enjoy movie alone.

1481
01:19:27,697 --> 01:19:30,577
If the movie is nice it
should reach everyone. Isn't it?

1482
01:19:30,857 --> 01:19:33,937
Okay, so that is
why you started piracy.

1483
01:19:34,577 --> 01:19:35,977
Piracy?

1484
01:19:36,297 --> 01:19:37,977
What does that mean, Girdhari?

1485
01:19:38,937 --> 01:19:43,817
I used to travel the world.

1486
01:19:43,897 --> 01:19:47,937
Wherever I saw a nice movie
I used to make one copy of it.

1487
01:19:48,017 --> 01:19:50,377
Did you understand? - So
this according to you is not piracy.

1488
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:56,097
Not forcefully, Arnab but with love.

1489
01:19:56,377 --> 01:19:58,417
Sometimes France and sometimes Cannes.

1490
01:19:58,537 --> 01:20:00,817
France and Cannes are the same Mr. D.

1491
01:20:00,897 --> 01:20:03,537
You understood it so
why are you going in detail.

1492
01:20:03,577 --> 01:20:06,617
So basically you picked
up a print from festivals.

1493
01:20:07,977 --> 01:20:10,057
Picked up?

1494
01:20:11,537 --> 01:20:13,337
Men are kidnapped.

1495
01:20:13,937 --> 01:20:16,097
Have you ever heard
that the film was kidnapped?

1496
01:20:16,737 --> 01:20:18,017
No, Have you heard?

1497
01:20:18,097 --> 01:20:19,657
A question to your passion for movies.

1498
01:20:19,817 --> 01:20:21,937
Do you invest in Bollywood?
- No.

1499
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:24,097
A lot of people believe that you do.

1500
01:20:24,177 --> 01:20:27,697
And you have a huge
piracy racket that causes..

1501
01:20:27,777 --> 01:20:31,097
..losses worth crores
to film industry every year.

1502
01:20:31,377 --> 01:20:32,657
Which losses?

1503
01:20:33,777 --> 01:20:35,217
Which losses?

1504
01:20:35,537 --> 01:20:38,097
First tell me where is my money?

1505
01:20:38,177 --> 01:20:39,577
Which money of yours?

1506
01:20:39,737 --> 01:20:44,337
The money that I should get
on every film that is based on me.

1507
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:45,777
Should I get it or not?

1508
01:20:45,977 --> 01:20:48,137
Intellectual property.

1509
01:20:48,537 --> 01:20:52,537
I am sure everyone wants
to know what your real business is.

1510
01:20:52,577 --> 01:20:56,257
Smuggling,
extortion, horse racing or what..

1511
01:20:56,457 --> 01:20:57,817
Nothing out of this.

1512
01:20:58,857 --> 01:21:01,097
Basically you are unemployed.

1513
01:21:01,577 --> 01:21:03,217
Shall I ask you
something brother Arnab?

1514
01:21:04,857 --> 01:21:09,217
Begal family in America,
Gonzalis family in South America..

1515
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:11,577
..and there are so
many names in Italy.

1516
01:21:11,657 --> 01:21:13,377
You will keep counting till evening.

1517
01:21:13,817 --> 01:21:17,177
All these people work
according to their wish.

1518
01:21:18,697 --> 01:21:20,257
Why do you have..

1519
01:21:20,977 --> 01:21:23,377
..special interest in me?

1520
01:21:23,457 --> 01:21:27,097
What special have they done
that no one says anything to them.

1521
01:21:27,177 --> 01:21:29,017
Mr. D you are evading my question.

1522
01:21:29,097 --> 01:21:31,097
Are you saying that
you don't do smuggling?

1523
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:34,937
Hey buddy, I am service provider.

1524
01:21:35,097 --> 01:21:36,897
Service provider.

1525
01:21:38,097 --> 01:21:42,857
Transport service,
courier service, mobile service..

1526
01:21:42,937 --> 01:21:44,617
From mobile service
I remember one thing.

1527
01:21:45,657 --> 01:21:49,737
Tell me one thing if a person
calls from an airtel number..

1528
01:21:49,817 --> 01:21:53,097
..and do kidnapping then
what is the fault of airtel.

1529
01:21:53,177 --> 01:21:56,457
You said courier service. So
that means are you dominoes of drugs.

1530
01:21:56,977 --> 01:22:00,537
Your question has two words
which I did not understand.

1531
01:22:00,737 --> 01:22:01,297
Okay.

1532
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:03,577
If you are a service provider..

1533
01:22:03,657 --> 01:22:06,737
..then why don't you openly
do business just like others?

1534
01:22:07,257 --> 01:22:09,097
I work openly.

1535
01:22:10,057 --> 01:22:13,297
You tell me how much material
you want me to send to your house.

1536
01:22:16,017 --> 01:22:17,137
I never meant that.

1537
01:22:20,297 --> 01:22:21,177
Leave it.

1538
01:22:22,057 --> 01:22:23,577
What about extortion?

1539
01:22:23,617 --> 01:22:25,217
I swear upon God..

1540
01:22:25,857 --> 01:22:27,977
..till today I have not
got anyone's child aborted.

1541
01:22:28,057 --> 01:22:31,577
Mr. D I am not talking
about abortion but of extortion.

1542
01:22:31,657 --> 01:22:35,257
Okay, what is the meaning of this?
I do not know its meaning.

1543
01:22:35,337 --> 01:22:38,537
Actor..he understands
intellectual property..

1544
01:22:38,577 --> 01:22:40,457
..but does not understand extortion.

1545
01:22:40,537 --> 01:22:44,097
Extortion means to obtain
money through force or threat.

1546
01:22:44,297 --> 01:22:45,457
Amazing.

1547
01:22:46,217 --> 01:22:49,217
Why do people come to
the point of force and threat?

1548
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,657
What is my fault in this?

1549
01:22:50,737 --> 01:22:53,777
So you do agree that
you extract money from people.

1550
01:22:53,857 --> 01:22:57,017
If I provide service then
will surely give the bill.

1551
01:22:57,097 --> 01:23:00,577
Do you take salary from
the channel to do this show?

1552
01:23:00,737 --> 01:23:04,777
Okay Mr. D I think you are
not in mood to give direct answers.

1553
01:23:04,857 --> 01:23:06,897
Let's shift to some lighter questions.

1554
01:23:08,177 --> 01:23:11,537
You have already shifted
from brother to Mr. D

1555
01:23:11,577 --> 01:23:15,137
Even you have shifted from Mr.
Arnab to brother Arnab.

1556
01:23:19,457 --> 01:23:22,257
Who is your favorite actor?

1557
01:23:22,337 --> 01:23:24,737
Bruce Wills and Sylvester Stallone.

1558
01:23:25,017 --> 01:23:26,417
So you see Hollywood as well.

1559
01:23:26,537 --> 01:23:27,737
I see only Hollywood.

1560
01:23:27,817 --> 01:23:30,017
That is strange but why not Bollywood.

1561
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:32,017
I don't like movies from South and..

1562
01:23:32,097 --> 01:23:34,337
..you do not make
anything else except that.

1563
01:23:35,057 --> 01:23:36,577
Who is your favorite heroine?

1564
01:23:36,617 --> 01:23:38,377
No one is nice in your country.

1565
01:23:38,457 --> 01:23:41,177
Some have fake lips,
some do not know Hindi..

1566
01:23:41,257 --> 01:23:42,777
..and if you see someone
without make up..

1567
01:23:42,857 --> 01:23:44,337
..then you would get paralysis attack.

1568
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:47,737
Where do you get all these from?

1569
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:50,417
Okay, so who do you like?

1570
01:23:50,537 --> 01:23:53,177
Nazreena..
- But she is from Bollywood.

1571
01:23:53,337 --> 01:23:58,057
She is in Bollywood now. Her
actual work started in New York's bar.

1572
01:23:58,657 --> 01:24:00,577
Mr. D this is a family show..

1573
01:24:00,657 --> 01:24:03,817
..so it would be better if
you keep your responses censored.

1574
01:24:03,897 --> 01:24:06,897
If you were to do family show
then why are you interviewing me?

1575
01:24:06,977 --> 01:24:09,537
You should have done of
Sooraj Barjatya or Raju Hirani.

1576
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:13,137
Believe me I tried for that
but they are busier than you nowadays.

1577
01:24:13,217 --> 01:24:15,417
Shall I arrange by calling them now?

1578
01:24:15,737 --> 01:24:19,937
Anyway, other than
Hollywood what do you like?

1579
01:24:20,417 --> 01:24:23,457
Other than Hollywood
I like to see porn.

1580
01:24:23,537 --> 01:24:29,377
There is no story in this as well
in that but action is surely there.

1581
01:24:29,817 --> 01:24:33,137
But nowadays many such movies
are being made in Bollywood..

1582
01:24:33,217 --> 01:24:34,657
..where there is so much action.

1583
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:39,097
For example Jism 2, Ragini MMS 2
Extreme action.

1584
01:24:39,177 --> 01:24:41,617
So you had to get a porn star.

1585
01:24:44,177 --> 01:24:48,137
Okay, With that we take a short break.
Stay with us we will just be back.

1586
01:24:53,257 --> 01:24:57,977
Special LIV-IN condoms. Made from
Nigeria's special 4N TCM polyster.

1587
01:24:58,057 --> 01:24:59,777
You need not remove it.

1588
01:24:59,857 --> 01:25:02,337
You never know when
you would get a chance.

1589
01:25:02,617 --> 01:25:06,337
It adjusts according to your size.

1590
01:25:06,457 --> 01:25:11,297
So that at the time
of need you are ready.

1591
01:25:11,937 --> 01:25:15,657
LIV-In condoms. Keep wearing it.

1592
01:25:16,057 --> 01:25:16,897
Don't remove it.

1593
01:25:16,977 --> 01:25:19,217
Welcome back. I am still with D.

1594
01:25:19,737 --> 01:25:21,897
A man who is not
ready to give answer..

1595
01:25:21,977 --> 01:25:24,257
..but we are trying
to find answers from him.

1596
01:25:24,657 --> 01:25:30,097
Sir, tell me something about
your journey from Mumbai to here.

1597
01:25:31,697 --> 01:25:32,977
Not Mumbai.

1598
01:25:33,937 --> 01:25:35,017
Okay, sure.

1599
01:25:35,457 --> 01:25:37,337
That reminds me.

1600
01:25:37,417 --> 01:25:39,137
I received a call yesterday that..

1601
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:41,297
..there is no water in
my area for last three days.

1602
01:25:41,777 --> 01:25:43,937
You cannot do such a small work.

1603
01:25:44,537 --> 01:25:47,817
Mr. D let me remind you
that I am not in municipality.

1604
01:25:47,897 --> 01:25:50,297
Not that I have remembered
then let me get it done.

1605
01:25:50,377 --> 01:25:51,977
Call up Gaitonde.

1606
01:25:53,137 --> 01:25:55,457
I will just show you
what municipality is.

1607
01:25:59,657 --> 01:26:01,177
Hello..
- Gaitonde...

1608
01:26:01,257 --> 01:26:02,017
Greetings, brother.

1609
01:26:02,217 --> 01:26:03,377
How are you?
- Absolutely fine.

1610
01:26:03,457 --> 01:26:04,217
Greetings.

1611
01:26:04,617 --> 01:26:06,337
All that is fine. Listen to me.

1612
01:26:07,377 --> 01:26:09,457
There is no water
in Dongri for three days.

1613
01:26:10,137 --> 01:26:14,017
Send tanker there quickly
and I will not call again.

1614
01:26:15,057 --> 01:26:18,537
Yes brother Arnab, tell me.

1615
01:26:18,577 --> 01:26:21,537
Mr. D you have still
not answered my question.

1616
01:26:21,577 --> 01:26:24,657
Tell me about your
journey from...to here.

1617
01:26:24,737 --> 01:26:28,897
Look Dongri brought me up,
waiting room helped me to grow

1618
01:26:28,977 --> 01:26:31,297
Wadala and Manish Market made me Don.

1619
01:26:31,377 --> 01:26:33,617
Your government made me fugitive.

1620
01:26:33,697 --> 01:26:36,377
That is all about my journey.

1621
01:26:36,577 --> 01:26:40,537
And how did you reach this place?

1622
01:26:40,577 --> 01:26:42,857
Here I have come with my wish.
Ask why?

1623
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:43,857
Why?

1624
01:26:44,817 --> 01:26:47,337
I Karachi I feel the fragrance of....

1625
01:26:47,417 --> 01:26:50,057
Okay now that e are
talking of fragrance then..

1626
01:26:50,137 --> 01:26:52,977
..do you want to say
something about 93 blasts.

1627
01:26:53,057 --> 01:26:56,377
Don't go there otherwise
interview will become like that.

1628
01:26:56,457 --> 01:26:58,577
Mr. D it is my job to go there.

1629
01:26:58,937 --> 01:27:01,297
I am also a service provider like you.

1630
01:27:01,377 --> 01:27:02,377
I deliver truth.

1631
01:27:02,457 --> 01:27:05,817
Then go and find truth somewhere else.
There is no truth about this here.

1632
01:27:05,897 --> 01:27:07,057
So you do not want to say anything.

1633
01:27:07,137 --> 01:27:09,457
How did the battery
of the remote decreased?

1634
01:27:11,097 --> 01:27:15,097
Brother Arnab,
in childhood my mother had explained..

1635
01:27:15,177 --> 01:27:17,617
..that if someone has
made up his mind then..

1636
01:27:17,697 --> 01:27:20,937
..don't waste time
to make him understand.

1637
01:27:21,137 --> 01:27:24,017
Okay so if you won't
tell then let me ask.

1638
01:27:24,337 --> 01:27:28,217
Were you involved in 93 blasts?
- No.

1639
01:27:28,857 --> 01:27:30,177
Not a plain no.

1640
01:27:30,257 --> 01:27:32,177
I was not involved so
you want me to give a speech..

1641
01:27:32,257 --> 01:27:34,137
..of three and a half minutes on it.

1642
01:27:34,217 --> 01:27:35,217
What rubbish is this?

1643
01:27:35,297 --> 01:27:39,617
It is very clear from the evidences
that you had supplied bombs.

1644
01:27:40,097 --> 01:27:42,177
Yes I did.
When did I say that I didn't?

1645
01:27:42,337 --> 01:27:44,337
But you just said that
you were not involved.

1646
01:27:44,777 --> 01:27:45,977
Brother..

1647
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:50,617
I supply the bombs
and crackers that burst.

1648
01:27:50,697 --> 01:27:54,017
I have a fireworks factory in....

1649
01:27:54,257 --> 01:27:58,337
So you are actually saying that
you own a fireworks factory in India.

1650
01:27:58,537 --> 01:27:59,257
Yes.

1651
01:27:59,457 --> 01:28:01,977
If you don't mind can you
tell me the name of that company?

1652
01:28:02,057 --> 01:28:03,577
You are again getting into details.

1653
01:28:04,257 --> 01:28:06,897
What did you say that
is was what of drugs?

1654
01:28:06,977 --> 01:28:08,617
Dominoes....
- Dominoes.

1655
01:28:08,697 --> 01:28:13,337
So understand that I am
big bazaar of bombs as well.

1656
01:28:14,137 --> 01:28:18,297
Let us talk about your
occupational hazards.

1657
01:28:19,137 --> 01:28:23,457
I mean let's talk about the problems
you face in running your business.

1658
01:28:23,777 --> 01:28:26,297
You must be facing problems
in running the business of bombs.

1659
01:28:26,537 --> 01:28:28,737
Yes, from problem I remember.

1660
01:28:28,817 --> 01:28:31,977
Yesterday Al-Qaida people
called and said that..

1661
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:34,817
..they had sent a suicide
bomb girl in Delhi.

1662
01:28:35,097 --> 01:28:37,257
She was passing through petrol pump..

1663
01:28:37,337 --> 01:28:39,857
..and four boys noticed
and thought she was their right.

1664
01:28:39,937 --> 01:28:40,737
And did....

1665
01:28:40,817 --> 01:28:45,937
Has it been declared
as official sport in Delhi?

1666
01:28:46,097 --> 01:28:50,337
Can you elaborate that
suicide bomber matter?

1667
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:51,897
Don't deviate from the issue.

1668
01:28:52,337 --> 01:28:59,097
The point is that in your country
a kind girl cannot work peacefully.

1669
01:28:59,177 --> 01:29:00,977
I agree....

1670
01:29:02,297 --> 01:29:07,097
But that so called innocent girl
had not gone there to do candle march.

1671
01:29:08,377 --> 01:29:10,257
Leave it. Let's just move on.

1672
01:29:10,897 --> 01:29:13,697
What other problems do you have?
- Attrition.

1673
01:29:13,777 --> 01:29:15,617
Great. He did not
understand unresolved..

1674
01:29:15,697 --> 01:29:18,017
..father issues but
knows of attrition.

1675
01:29:18,097 --> 01:29:20,857
Did you say anything?
- No nothing.

1676
01:29:20,937 --> 01:29:21,857
You carry on.

1677
01:29:22,177 --> 01:29:25,457
In last two months two hundred
people have stopped working for me.

1678
01:29:25,537 --> 01:29:29,177
Amazing. I had heard no
one can leave the job of Don.

1679
01:29:29,537 --> 01:29:33,257
You heard it right but your Baba..

1680
01:29:35,097 --> 01:29:36,137
..he keeps doing this.

1681
01:29:36,217 --> 01:29:38,177
I had sent to threaten him.

1682
01:29:39,057 --> 01:29:42,777
Three days they stayed in his camp and
said that they don't want to return.

1683
01:29:42,857 --> 01:29:46,137
Seeing them some people
left from there as well.

1684
01:29:46,217 --> 01:29:48,617
What SMS had come, Girdhari?

1685
01:29:49,177 --> 01:29:50,017
Show them.

1686
01:29:50,817 --> 01:29:52,097
Brother, we will not be able to do it.

1687
01:29:52,177 --> 01:29:54,537
Such SMS are coming.

1688
01:29:54,857 --> 01:29:55,537
What should we do?

1689
01:30:00,537 --> 01:30:01,817
Absolutely bomb.

1690
01:30:02,217 --> 01:30:03,617
Where?

1691
01:30:05,657 --> 01:30:07,577
Brother, what is her name?

1692
01:30:07,857 --> 01:30:09,337
Absolutely Bomb.

1693
01:30:16,257 --> 01:30:18,817
Where have you got lost?
Ask further, reporter.

1694
01:30:19,177 --> 01:30:20,737
Not reporter but senior editor.

1695
01:30:20,817 --> 01:30:22,137
What is the difference between both?

1696
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:24,457
The same that is there
between gangster and Don.

1697
01:30:26,377 --> 01:30:28,537
On this note let's take a short break.

1698
01:30:28,617 --> 01:30:32,177
I am still sitting with
the most wanted man on the planet.

1699
01:30:32,257 --> 01:30:36,817
And believe me things are going to get
lot more interesting. Don't go away.

1700
01:30:37,377 --> 01:30:38,817
Bring water for brother.

1701
01:30:39,217 --> 01:30:41,377
I will just check it.

1702
01:30:43,617 --> 01:30:45,137
I was saying....
- Water...

1703
01:30:47,217 --> 01:30:49,137
I was giving it to her.

1704
01:30:49,217 --> 01:30:50,537
So, I was saying...

1705
01:30:50,577 --> 01:30:52,297
Strange man you are.

1706
01:30:53,297 --> 01:30:55,377
Okay drink.

1707
01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:56,777
Thank you.

1708
01:31:05,737 --> 01:31:06,457
What happened?

1709
01:31:06,617 --> 01:31:10,697
These rich people are so stingy.

1710
01:31:10,777 --> 01:31:13,817
After begging for two hours we
got this and that also without sugar.

1711
01:31:13,897 --> 01:31:15,697
What are you talking?
Is there no sugar in this?

1712
01:31:15,937 --> 01:31:17,297
What should we do now?

1713
01:31:18,617 --> 01:31:20,697
I have an idea.
- What?

1714
01:31:21,017 --> 01:31:22,377
Wait, let me think.

1715
01:31:22,457 --> 01:31:24,137
Idea and that also you have to think.

1716
01:31:26,857 --> 01:31:30,337
Bomb, bond....

1717
01:31:30,417 --> 01:31:32,617
Brother, let me tell you one thing.

1718
01:31:33,017 --> 01:31:36,137
Since long this idea
was coming to my mind.

1719
01:31:36,217 --> 01:31:37,657
But just could not speak.

1720
01:31:37,737 --> 01:31:40,457
It is the effect of the company.

1721
01:31:42,337 --> 01:31:43,977
What has she given?

1722
01:31:44,057 --> 01:31:49,017
After Duryodhan only
you have dared to insult.

1723
01:31:49,297 --> 01:31:51,537
What do you mean?

1724
01:31:51,617 --> 01:31:55,017
It means to insult someone physically.

1725
01:31:55,097 --> 01:31:57,577
Is there any other
way to make someone naked?

1726
01:31:57,617 --> 01:31:59,897
Yes brother.
Which one?

1727
01:31:59,977 --> 01:32:01,097
Emotionally.

1728
01:32:14,777 --> 01:32:15,577
Hi.

1729
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:19,297
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1730
01:32:20,257 --> 01:32:21,537
You seem to belong to this place.

1731
01:32:21,937 --> 01:32:26,177
What do you mean?
I was born in Faislabad.

1732
01:32:26,697 --> 01:32:31,377
Okay. Don't you feel
guilty in working with D?

1733
01:32:35,297 --> 01:32:39,097
I mean in whatever you are
saying is not with conviction.

1734
01:32:39,417 --> 01:32:40,617
What is that?

1735
01:32:41,857 --> 01:32:46,537
You are not saying with true
heart whatever you want to say.

1736
01:32:46,737 --> 01:32:50,617
I am unmarried so do
not know the matter of heart.

1737
01:32:51,257 --> 01:32:55,897
If I was Gafur instead of Girdhari
then would you ask this question?

1738
01:32:55,977 --> 01:32:56,977
About guilt.

1739
01:33:00,857 --> 01:33:01,937
Do you want number?

1740
01:33:02,097 --> 01:33:04,657
No, there is a call for me.
Excuse me.

1741
01:33:06,577 --> 01:33:07,257
Yes sir.

1742
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:10,257
Come on Arnab,
he is killing you out there.

1743
01:33:10,977 --> 01:33:13,017
Have you gone there to
ask questions or give answers?

1744
01:33:13,417 --> 01:33:15,817
Just kick him in the guts man.

1745
01:33:16,537 --> 01:33:18,537
Do you know what the
reaction of the public is?

1746
01:33:18,737 --> 01:33:22,937
You are trending globally
with a hash tag national hero.

1747
01:33:23,017 --> 01:33:24,777
Do you know what that means?

1748
01:33:25,297 --> 01:33:27,697
He is smarter than
what we had thought of.

1749
01:33:28,177 --> 01:33:30,657
But don't worry it
is just the interval.

1750
01:33:30,857 --> 01:33:33,257
I will take care. Okay.

1751
01:33:35,937 --> 01:33:38,737
I think we are missing
an opportunity here.

1752
01:33:39,417 --> 01:33:42,457
We are interviewing the
biggest interview of the century.

1753
01:33:43,657 --> 01:33:47,097
Do you understand? This is Arnab v/s D

1754
01:33:47,657 --> 01:33:51,737
Alright then 3, 2, 1 going live.

1755
01:33:51,817 --> 01:33:54,537
Welcome back to the most
exciting part of the interview.

1756
01:33:54,617 --> 01:33:55,657
The rapid fire.

1757
01:33:55,937 --> 01:33:59,257
Yes, this is my favorite.
- Not this one sir.

1758
01:33:59,337 --> 01:34:03,017
Okay, the one in which you
ask questions one after the other.

1759
01:34:03,097 --> 01:34:05,977
And the one who gives answers
just say anything in haste.

1760
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:08,657
Is it that?
- Yes exactly.

1761
01:34:08,857 --> 01:34:09,657
So shall we move ahead?

1762
01:34:09,737 --> 01:34:11,577
You go ahead. I will speak from here.

1763
01:34:12,817 --> 01:34:16,217
In this round I will ask
you five questions in 1 minute.

1764
01:34:16,297 --> 01:34:18,217
You have to answer them quickly.

1765
01:34:18,297 --> 01:34:19,177
1st question.

1766
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:23,577
If you are left alone
on an island for one week..

1767
01:34:23,617 --> 01:34:25,457
..then whom would you
like to take with you?

1768
01:34:25,537 --> 01:34:26,537
Anyone would do.

1769
01:34:26,697 --> 01:34:27,817
What do you mean that anyone would do?

1770
01:34:27,897 --> 01:34:30,857
Because whosoever will come with me
but only I will be alive after one week.

1771
01:34:30,937 --> 01:34:34,817
If you get a chance
to meet American president..

1772
01:34:34,897 --> 01:34:38,217
..Pakistan PM and Indian
PM then who would you like to meet.

1773
01:34:38,297 --> 01:34:39,977
I do not like the Indian one.

1774
01:34:40,457 --> 01:34:42,537
US one is scared of me.

1775
01:34:42,577 --> 01:34:45,417
And as far as Pakistan PM is concerned
then he is almost here all the time.

1776
01:34:45,537 --> 01:34:47,617
Wait for 10 minutes and
I shall make you meet him.

1777
01:34:48,577 --> 01:34:50,657
Virat or Shahid?
- Whoever takes the money?

1778
01:34:50,857 --> 01:34:53,177
AK 47 or AK 56

1779
01:34:54,057 --> 01:34:57,697
Brain...most dangerous.

1780
01:34:57,777 --> 01:34:59,577
Nazreena or Geetika.

1781
01:34:59,657 --> 01:35:00,817
Both....

1782
01:35:02,137 --> 01:35:04,217
Not both but you have to choose one.

1783
01:35:04,457 --> 01:35:07,697
Both have come here.

1784
01:35:07,777 --> 01:35:08,577
Okay.

1785
01:35:08,657 --> 01:35:12,777
If there is biopic on D then
whom would you want to play your role?

1786
01:35:13,577 --> 01:35:14,577
Shashi Kapoor.

1787
01:35:14,657 --> 01:35:16,177
Mr. Shashi Kapoor. Why?

1788
01:35:16,257 --> 01:35:19,657
Even I have bungalow,
car and money but..

1789
01:35:20,057 --> 01:35:22,297
..mother is still with him till today.

1790
01:35:22,377 --> 01:35:23,257
Okay.

1791
01:35:23,337 --> 01:35:25,137
Black money or white money?

1792
01:35:26,297 --> 01:35:30,027
I am not racist like you.
Black and white is same for me.

1793
01:35:30,027 --> 01:35:30,137
If you would like to change one thing
in your life then what would it be.
I am not racist like you.
Black and white is same for me.

1794
01:35:30,137 --> 01:35:33,707
If you would like to change one thing
in your life then what would it be.

1795
01:35:33,907 --> 01:35:37,227
Instead of Dongri I would
like to be born in Colaba.

1796
01:35:37,307 --> 01:35:39,547
After that life would
automatically change.

1797
01:35:39,627 --> 01:35:44,547
I have to say that you
have answered well and frank.

1798
01:35:44,627 --> 01:35:46,867
Leave all this, where is the hamper?

1799
01:35:47,227 --> 01:35:47,947
Which hamper?

1800
01:35:48,027 --> 01:35:52,107
The hamper that you
give after the rapid fire.

1801
01:35:52,227 --> 01:35:53,627
I did not talk about that.

1802
01:35:53,707 --> 01:35:55,307
That is not my problem
if you did not talk.

1803
01:35:55,387 --> 01:35:57,787
A hamper is always
given after rapid fire.

1804
01:35:57,867 --> 01:35:58,587
Everyone knows it.

1805
01:35:58,667 --> 01:35:59,787
Do you know or not?

1806
01:36:00,227 --> 01:36:01,067
Where is it?

1807
01:36:01,187 --> 01:36:04,267
Sir, we will get it delivered
to you once we reach India.

1808
01:36:07,547 --> 01:36:10,347
Hurry up and ask further.
It is time for my prayers.

1809
01:36:10,587 --> 01:36:12,627
So Mr. D this is our
live audience segment.

1810
01:36:12,707 --> 01:36:15,787
In Mumbai studio a panel
of three people is sitting.

1811
01:36:15,867 --> 01:36:17,427
They will directly
ask questions from you.

1812
01:36:18,307 --> 01:36:20,867
First of all Rohit Shukla from JNU.

1813
01:36:21,267 --> 01:36:23,587
Rohit, ask your question please.

1814
01:36:23,787 --> 01:36:26,667
Mr. D your responses till now show..

1815
01:36:26,747 --> 01:36:28,507
..that you do not
have illegal business..

1816
01:36:28,587 --> 01:36:30,827
..and till now you have
never gone against law.

1817
01:36:30,907 --> 01:36:32,627
Practically very hard to believe.

1818
01:36:32,947 --> 01:36:35,867
Hey, when did I say this sir?

1819
01:36:35,947 --> 01:36:38,827
No Mr D we can have
a re learn of the interview.

1820
01:36:38,907 --> 01:36:41,427
We are asking you something
and you are answering differently.

1821
01:36:41,507 --> 01:36:45,387
Instead of you if I play interview of
Chhota Bheem it would look the same.

1822
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:47,227
Really..
- Yes..

1823
01:36:47,307 --> 01:36:48,507
Come on....

1824
01:36:49,427 --> 01:36:53,107
I have broken countless laws.

1825
01:36:53,227 --> 01:36:54,867
Now we are talking.
Tell us more please.

1826
01:36:54,947 --> 01:36:56,787
From last 3 years I
have not paid service tax.

1827
01:36:56,867 --> 01:36:59,587
So you mean you have not
broken bigger law than this.

1828
01:36:59,667 --> 01:37:05,027
Brother, you had said that
it is a family show so be censored.

1829
01:37:05,107 --> 01:37:07,707
Our next question is from Mr.
Vijay Chakraborty..

1830
01:37:07,787 --> 01:37:11,907
..who is our special guest tonight
from external affairs ministry.

1831
01:37:13,507 --> 01:37:16,227
Can you tell us Mr. D that which
country's citizenship do you have?

1832
01:37:16,867 --> 01:37:19,627
Don't censor this.
I will take care of it.

1833
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:37,067
Take this.
This is the proof of my citizenship.

1834
01:37:37,187 --> 01:37:39,827
Whatever you feel is
more controversial keep it.

1835
01:37:40,827 --> 01:37:42,987
What the hell? What is this?

1836
01:37:43,587 --> 01:37:46,667
These are passport of 192 countries.

1837
01:37:48,707 --> 01:37:52,387
You want to say that you
are citizen of the entire world.

1838
01:37:52,467 --> 01:37:54,667
No, 4 still remain.

1839
01:37:54,747 --> 01:37:56,427
Girdhari, what happened
about those 4 countries?

1840
01:37:56,507 --> 01:37:58,947
Brother, we have applied
for it so it will come in 4 days.

1841
01:37:59,027 --> 01:38:01,427
He must have made it in tatkaal.

1842
01:38:02,107 --> 01:38:04,227
He is the one who was
the owner of the gun shop.

1843
01:38:04,307 --> 01:38:07,907
Our next question is from
Miss Neha who is our ace news writer.

1844
01:38:09,867 --> 01:38:11,307
Hi Mr. D

1845
01:38:11,907 --> 01:38:14,387
This question is from
your female audience.

1846
01:38:14,507 --> 01:38:17,067
Why do you always keep
moustache and what is this..

1847
01:38:17,187 --> 01:38:19,987
..fascination with the
same brand of sunglasses.

1848
01:38:21,867 --> 01:38:23,507
Why do I keep moustache?

1849
01:38:24,507 --> 01:38:26,707
I get a character.

1850
01:38:27,227 --> 01:38:29,667
I cannot keep a tail so
that is why I keep moustaches.

1851
01:38:31,267 --> 01:38:35,267
Without moustaches I feel
a man is standing naked on the road.

1852
01:38:37,347 --> 01:38:39,627
As far as sunglasses are concerned.

1853
01:38:40,027 --> 01:38:44,347
So all things related
to me are banned in the world.

1854
01:38:44,547 --> 01:38:47,347
So my glasses would be Ray Ban.

1855
01:38:49,547 --> 01:38:53,187
A big thanks to our
panel in Mumbai and to Neha.

1856
01:38:53,587 --> 01:38:55,267
World reminds me that..

1857
01:38:56,187 --> 01:39:01,027
..there is a rumor that you knew
in advance about the Osama killings.

1858
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:04,267
I knew it? My men killed him.

1859
01:39:05,307 --> 01:39:07,587
Such a big joke doesn't
suit your moustaches.

1860
01:39:07,667 --> 01:39:09,387
I am telling you the truth Mr. Arnab.

1861
01:39:09,627 --> 01:39:12,547
For three months he had not
paid the EMI of protection money.

1862
01:39:12,627 --> 01:39:13,707
So I had no option.

1863
01:39:13,787 --> 01:39:16,707
What are you talking?
US did such a big cowat operation.

1864
01:39:16,787 --> 01:39:18,027
A movie has been made on that.

1865
01:39:18,107 --> 01:39:21,227
A movie has been made on Jurassic
Park as well but that is not true.

1866
01:39:21,667 --> 01:39:26,067
So you are saying such a big
operation by US was a video game.

1867
01:39:26,187 --> 01:39:26,947
Is that what you are saying?

1868
01:39:27,027 --> 01:39:29,547
Brother, anyone may do the operation..

1869
01:39:29,627 --> 01:39:32,867
..but what do you know which people
are behind the commando uniform.

1870
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:36,787
Wow! It is very hard to tell
whether it is fact or fiction.

1871
01:39:37,667 --> 01:39:43,707
Even about 93 blasts no one
knows whether it is fact or fiction.

1872
01:39:45,747 --> 01:39:47,587
On that note we take a short break.

1873
01:39:47,667 --> 01:39:50,227
We will be back with our
final leg of the interview.

1874
01:40:01,867 --> 01:40:03,467
Hello, is everything fine there?

1875
01:40:03,667 --> 01:40:05,907
Everything is fine here.
But what are you doing?

1876
01:40:05,987 --> 01:40:06,667
What happened?

1877
01:40:06,747 --> 01:40:09,467
The problem is that
nothing has happened?

1878
01:40:10,187 --> 01:40:13,787
I had married a man who
was court martial on live TV

1879
01:40:14,187 --> 01:40:17,467
And not with a man who
would get scared of a hooligan.

1880
01:40:18,187 --> 01:40:21,867
Otherwise what do you think a crime
reporter like me would marry you?

1881
01:40:21,947 --> 01:40:23,787
Tell me what do you want to say?

1882
01:40:24,187 --> 01:40:27,187
Listen, it might
sound cheesy out to you

1883
01:40:27,467 --> 01:40:29,707
But you definitely remember
our journalism oath, right.

1884
01:40:30,227 --> 01:40:35,747
We will uphold the dignity of this
country and its media come what may.

1885
01:40:36,427 --> 01:40:38,987
Yes, it is getting cheesy and sweet.

1886
01:40:39,067 --> 01:40:41,707
Shut up, Arnab.
This is not a joke.

1887
01:40:43,387 --> 01:40:46,267
You are on the verge
of becoming national hero.

1888
01:40:47,587 --> 01:40:49,587
How many people get this chance?

1889
01:40:50,547 --> 01:40:52,907
Social media is going dessert.

1890
01:40:53,107 --> 01:40:54,667
Do you realize the gravity?

1891
01:40:54,867 --> 01:40:58,107
He must be a hooligan of somewhere.
What do we have to do?

1892
01:40:58,347 --> 01:41:01,707
Just remember that you are
the biggest hooligan of Indian media.

1893
01:41:01,947 --> 01:41:05,307
This is not just an interview
anymore to save your job.

1894
01:41:06,107 --> 01:41:09,427
This is that trial of D which has not
happened in court for last 22 years.

1895
01:41:10,227 --> 01:41:12,307
And it does not matter
if it is a media trial.

1896
01:41:13,347 --> 01:41:16,547
We cannot afford to lose this Arnab.

1897
01:41:17,267 --> 01:41:20,347
And India cannot afford to lose this.
So don't worry about me.

1898
01:41:20,547 --> 01:41:21,547
I am fine.

1899
01:41:21,747 --> 01:41:23,787
And as it is I have
done a text to police.

1900
01:41:24,627 --> 01:41:28,627
So you just go out there
and grab him by his fucking balls.

1901
01:41:29,507 --> 01:41:30,667
Bye.

1902
01:41:49,707 --> 01:41:54,107
I had never thought that I
would smoke a cigarette with you ever.

1903
01:41:54,627 --> 01:41:56,187
Have you tried a cigar?

1904
01:41:57,267 --> 01:41:58,347
No.

1905
01:41:59,627 --> 01:42:01,027
It hurts my throat.

1906
01:42:03,627 --> 01:42:07,507
Do you know why I didn't
ask for interview's script..

1907
01:42:07,587 --> 01:42:09,947
..before saying yes to the interview?

1908
01:42:11,267 --> 01:42:14,627
Because I thought
you are a family man..

1909
01:42:15,267 --> 01:42:20,027
..and would remain in your limits
because of fear of wife's death.

1910
01:42:20,267 --> 01:42:21,827
I thought you would
remain in your limits.

1911
01:42:22,787 --> 01:42:26,347
But I had forgotten that media
people never remain in their limits.

1912
01:42:30,427 --> 01:42:31,947
Just relax.

1913
01:42:32,227 --> 01:42:34,827
We both will together take
care of the interview further.

1914
01:42:34,907 --> 01:42:36,547
But remain in your limits.

1915
01:42:37,547 --> 01:42:43,347
Otherwise it is Don's interview
on live TV so anything can happen.

1916
01:42:44,387 --> 01:42:45,547
What did you understand?

1917
01:42:48,867 --> 01:42:49,987
-It is happening too much.
-Yes you are right.

1918
01:42:50,067 --> 01:42:50,987
Okay fine.
- Okay.

1919
01:42:53,427 --> 01:42:56,467
It is the last leg of the
interview so let's make it count.

1920
01:42:56,667 --> 01:42:59,267
This is your revised
draft for the final segment.

1921
01:42:59,347 --> 01:43:01,067
Just show him his place Arnab.

1922
01:43:06,467 --> 01:43:09,707
Welcome back to One
on One with me Arnab Ghsoh.

1923
01:43:09,787 --> 01:43:11,787
Now we have reached
our final segment..

1924
01:43:11,867 --> 01:43:15,547
..where we will ask some
inconvenient questions to MR. D

1925
01:43:16,507 --> 01:43:18,467
Are you ready?
- Yes.

1926
01:43:19,947 --> 01:43:23,267
From your talks we can make out that
your influence is on the global level.

1927
01:43:23,467 --> 01:43:27,427
So were you behind
the hijacking in Kandahar?

1928
01:43:27,507 --> 01:43:30,067
It is a limit.

1929
01:43:30,507 --> 01:43:31,627
Now you would say..

1930
01:43:31,707 --> 01:43:34,227
..that I am responsible for the
Malaysian airlines that got missing.

1931
01:43:34,307 --> 01:43:35,707
I won't say that but
a Gulf news report says so.

1932
01:43:36,187 --> 01:43:38,787
I won't say that but
a Gulf news report says so.

1933
01:43:38,867 --> 01:43:40,427
This report is right.

1934
01:43:40,507 --> 01:43:42,467
So are you telling
me a fact or a fiction?

1935
01:43:42,547 --> 01:43:45,307
I have said what I wanted to say
now understand whatever you want to.

1936
01:43:45,387 --> 01:43:48,067
Mr. D let me be very
categorical in my question.

1937
01:43:48,187 --> 01:43:51,027
So you are saying that you
are behind the disappearance..

1938
01:43:51,107 --> 01:43:54,467
..of two Malaysian
planes including MH 370.

1939
01:43:54,547 --> 01:43:58,107
There is no need to be hyper.
Relax, relax..

1940
01:43:58,227 --> 01:43:59,907
Is there no need to get hyper?

1941
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:03,787
You are saying that
flight disappearance..

1942
01:44:03,867 --> 01:44:06,467
..in Malaysia have
been engineered by you.

1943
01:44:06,547 --> 01:44:08,507
And you are asking me to calm down.

1944
01:44:09,427 --> 01:44:12,907
All this has been made by media,
my brother.

1945
01:44:12,987 --> 01:44:15,627
Nothing of this kind had happened.
- Then what had happened?

1946
01:44:15,987 --> 01:44:20,427
What happened was that I had to sit in
flight from Kuala Lampur to Karachi.

1947
01:44:20,627 --> 01:44:22,867
And those rascals made
e sit in Beijing flight.

1948
01:44:22,947 --> 01:44:24,547
Tell me what my fault in this is.

1949
01:44:25,107 --> 01:44:27,547
I had to reach hurriedly
for my nephew's wedding..

1950
01:44:27,627 --> 01:44:29,707
..so we had to divert the flight.

1951
01:44:29,787 --> 01:44:31,507
Look, she is standing behind you.

1952
01:44:32,467 --> 01:44:35,587
Now you will say that passengers
of the flight are also here.

1953
01:44:38,867 --> 01:44:42,547
So do you think I have so many
servants in my house from beginning?

1954
01:44:46,027 --> 01:44:48,467
What about the second Malaysian plane?

1955
01:44:48,667 --> 01:44:52,587
You are too much, Arnab.

1956
01:44:53,267 --> 01:44:58,347
After the problem I faced am I
stupid to travel by that flight again.

1957
01:44:58,867 --> 01:45:03,747
No wonders your name is also
there in the top 10 list of the FBI

1958
01:45:04,347 --> 01:45:07,387
This is the problem.
- What is the problem?

1959
01:45:07,547 --> 01:45:13,387
The problem is Arnab
that I used to be number 1.

1960
01:45:13,667 --> 01:45:17,347
In last three years I
have come down to number 6.

1961
01:45:17,707 --> 01:45:22,547
Boys whom I have trained
are on top of the list.

1962
01:45:22,787 --> 01:45:24,867
What times have come?

1963
01:45:24,947 --> 01:45:26,707
You have become sentimental.

1964
01:45:26,867 --> 01:45:28,987
No problem. Everyone's time comes.

1965
01:45:30,707 --> 01:45:35,467
I think that censor
thing does not apply to you.

1966
01:45:35,667 --> 01:45:38,787
It does apply Mr. D but
I also get sentimental sometimes.

1967
01:45:39,227 --> 01:45:42,227
I am sure you must be having
plan to become number 1 again.

1968
01:45:42,307 --> 01:45:43,827
Yes I have a plan.

1969
01:45:44,987 --> 01:45:49,467
If I shoot you on live TV
then I can become number 1 overnight.

1970
01:45:49,547 --> 01:45:51,627
You are again talking like a hooligan.

1971
01:45:51,987 --> 01:45:54,107
There is a difference
between saying and doing Mr. D.

1972
01:45:54,187 --> 01:45:55,307
My hero.

1973
01:45:55,387 --> 01:45:59,827
Finally on popular
demand one last question.

1974
01:45:59,987 --> 01:46:01,187
Popular demand.

1975
01:46:02,467 --> 01:46:04,467
Will I have to dance?

1976
01:46:06,027 --> 01:46:08,707
You can do if you wish
to but that is not the case.

1977
01:46:09,067 --> 01:46:10,187
Okay.

1978
01:46:10,347 --> 01:46:13,867
Viewers want to know that you..

1979
01:46:13,947 --> 01:46:15,467
..have many fake accounts
on facebook and twitter.

1980
01:46:15,547 --> 01:46:18,707
Often you are being bullied on that.
What do you have to say about that?

1981
01:46:18,787 --> 01:46:19,907
Are you saying correct?

1982
01:46:20,227 --> 01:46:21,827
Of course.

1983
01:46:23,467 --> 01:46:27,267
One account is exactly
on your name with status update..

1984
01:46:27,347 --> 01:46:29,507
..check in, and share happening often.

1985
01:46:29,587 --> 01:46:30,507
Show it to me.

1986
01:46:30,947 --> 01:46:32,227
Show me which account is this?

1987
01:46:34,947 --> 01:46:36,827
This one.
- Yes.

1988
01:46:41,707 --> 01:46:44,187
What is the matter?
Why are you laughing at your own joke?

1989
01:46:44,227 --> 01:46:45,467
This is my account.

1990
01:46:47,707 --> 01:46:49,867
Girdhari takes care of it.

1991
01:46:50,667 --> 01:46:52,187
Show Girdhari..

1992
01:46:53,107 --> 01:46:54,507
Look, look..

1993
01:46:55,067 --> 01:46:55,947
Look.

1994
01:46:56,627 --> 01:47:00,387
I had gone to Malaysia and
had checked-in in that hotel. Look.

1995
01:47:00,787 --> 01:47:05,107
Once I was getting a philosopher
kind of feeling like..

1996
01:47:05,187 --> 01:47:09,947
..Danish type so I asked
him to put that status.

1997
01:47:10,027 --> 01:47:12,347
Look, look..

1998
01:47:13,067 --> 01:47:16,907
I had gone to PM's daughter's wedding
and I have put photograph of the deal.

1999
01:47:20,987 --> 01:47:24,467
Look Girdhari the face of
facebook has become like Doordarshan.

2000
01:47:24,547 --> 01:47:27,707
You had put these
on..what do you call it?

2001
01:47:27,787 --> 01:47:29,347
Gram Panchayat.

2002
01:47:29,427 --> 01:47:31,947
Gram Panchayat.
- Instagram.

2003
01:47:32,027 --> 01:47:33,467
Instagram.

2004
01:47:34,547 --> 01:47:36,547
Don't do anything that
will lead to thrashing.

2005
01:47:36,627 --> 01:47:38,507
One last question?

2006
01:47:40,387 --> 01:47:42,467
Why did you escape from India?

2007
01:47:44,387 --> 01:47:45,667
I did not escape.

2008
01:47:46,707 --> 01:47:50,507
I was going to settle
in Dubai to expand my business.

2009
01:47:50,787 --> 01:47:54,667
Unfortunately the blasts took place
and you all thought that I escaped.

2010
01:47:55,427 --> 01:47:57,947
Then why did you leave
your people alone in India.

2011
01:47:58,387 --> 01:48:01,507
Or you had planned
to settle abroad alone.

2012
01:48:02,187 --> 01:48:03,507
That's okay. There is no problem.

2013
01:48:03,587 --> 01:48:06,467
There are many people who
are not bothered about others.

2014
01:48:06,627 --> 01:48:08,787
And go away from home for business.
That is fine.

2015
01:48:08,867 --> 01:48:13,187
Arnab, this time I will
not show a trailer on mobile..

2016
01:48:13,907 --> 01:48:15,587
..but will show live shooting.

2017
01:48:15,667 --> 01:48:19,227
What trailer will you show me?
I will show you your status.

2018
01:48:19,307 --> 01:48:21,107
Hey, talk sensibly.

2019
01:48:21,187 --> 01:48:22,307
Hey, you keep quiet.

2020
01:48:22,507 --> 01:48:24,187
You do not have the status
to become constable in your country..

2021
01:48:24,227 --> 01:48:25,827
..and here you are his right hand.

2022
01:48:25,907 --> 01:48:27,347
Do you know what
you do with right hand?

2023
01:48:27,427 --> 01:48:30,787
Quiet. - Girdhari, leave it. A it
is the bullets have become expensive.

2024
01:48:30,867 --> 01:48:32,427
Why are you wasting it? Leave it.

2025
01:48:34,027 --> 01:48:37,547
D I will tell you
what your problem is.

2026
01:48:37,747 --> 01:48:40,947
You have kept 200 body
guards and security system..

2027
01:48:41,027 --> 01:48:42,467
..because you are scared.

2028
01:48:42,907 --> 01:48:45,187
Sitting under so much
of security in the house..

2029
01:48:45,267 --> 01:48:47,307
..you are talking about courage.

2030
01:48:47,387 --> 01:48:51,067
If you are such a big dynamic
Don then dare to come back.

2031
01:48:51,547 --> 01:48:54,747
Delhi is only 1100 kms away
from here but you cannot go there.

2032
01:48:55,027 --> 01:48:57,467
You can go to Nairobi, Malaysia..

2033
01:48:57,547 --> 01:49:00,987
..and even have passport
of the world with you.

2034
01:49:01,067 --> 01:49:04,347
But will never come to Delhi.
Shall I tell you why?

2035
01:49:04,427 --> 01:49:06,227
Because you belong to no one.

2036
01:49:06,947 --> 01:49:09,867
You neither belong to your
family nor to your country men.

2037
01:49:10,027 --> 01:49:14,707
The country in which you were born
you killed 257 people of that country.

2038
01:49:14,787 --> 01:49:20,387
The area that brought you up is going
to police and court because of you.

2039
01:49:20,467 --> 01:49:22,787
But you think that you are Don.

2040
01:49:22,867 --> 01:49:27,587
You are Bhai but your brother was
hanged six months ago in our country.

2041
01:49:27,667 --> 01:49:28,547
Do you remember?

2042
01:49:29,187 --> 01:49:30,587
You should have saved him.

2043
01:49:30,827 --> 01:49:33,427
You are scared of
your own criminal record.

2044
01:49:33,507 --> 01:49:37,867
You are so scared that for your
crime you let your brother get hanged.

2045
01:49:41,347 --> 01:49:41,827
Take this.

2046
01:49:42,027 --> 01:49:43,907
If I play this CD now..

2047
01:49:43,987 --> 01:49:45,667
..then it will take
only 5 minutes to prove..

2048
01:49:45,747 --> 01:49:47,787
..that all allegations
on you are true.

2049
01:49:48,227 --> 01:49:51,707
You are fond of watching movies
so let's watch this CD together.

2050
01:49:52,467 --> 01:49:56,347
You will not see because till today
you have been running from yourself.

2051
01:49:56,987 --> 01:49:59,347
Don are those who accept
their crime openly.

2052
01:49:59,427 --> 01:50:02,267
They either accept or deny openly.

2053
01:50:02,347 --> 01:50:05,187
They do not hide behind random
fantasy stories just as you do.

2054
01:50:05,267 --> 01:50:08,187
But what to do you are a coward.

2055
01:50:08,747 --> 01:50:12,227
Now rest of your life you
will escape from these allegations..

2056
01:50:12,307 --> 01:50:16,117
..and when you die then everyone
will run from burial place..

2057
01:50:16,197 --> 01:50:19,947
..because there will be no difference
between you and your crimes.

2058
01:50:20,227 --> 01:50:24,547
This is your luck D.
you are not Don but fraud.

2059
01:50:27,187 --> 01:50:28,187
Wow! Arnab.

2060
01:50:40,267 --> 01:50:41,707
Brother...
- What have you done?

2061
01:50:45,307 --> 01:50:46,227
I have not done anything.

2062
01:50:46,307 --> 01:50:47,547
Give me the arms.

2063
01:50:47,627 --> 01:50:48,627
You take care of brother.

2064
01:50:48,707 --> 01:50:50,427
Girdhari, he has killed brother.

2065
01:50:50,507 --> 01:50:52,267
I have to take revenge
for what he has done.

2066
01:50:52,347 --> 01:50:53,187
Take care here.

2067
01:50:53,347 --> 01:50:55,547
Out, get out....

2068
01:51:04,267 --> 01:51:05,547
Brother....

2069
01:51:05,627 --> 01:51:08,187
Oh god, he has made me crazy.

2070
01:51:08,227 --> 01:51:10,667
Brother's heart is very good.
- Come on..

2071
01:51:10,907 --> 01:51:14,347
so he had to get heart attack.
- Come on, come on it is time to go.

2072
01:51:14,547 --> 01:51:16,507
Brother's heart is very big.
- Okay..

2073
01:51:17,067 --> 01:51:18,027
Bye...

2074
01:51:19,187 --> 01:51:21,627
Come on....

2075
01:51:23,187 --> 01:51:23,987
Brother....

2076
01:51:25,827 --> 01:51:27,507
Hey, come on.

2077
01:51:28,667 --> 01:51:29,347
Come..

2078
01:51:35,347 --> 01:51:36,747
Do you know what the right hand does?

2079
01:51:36,827 --> 01:51:39,747
The right hand shoots, presses
the trigger, slaps and takes revenge.

2080
01:51:39,827 --> 01:51:41,667
Don't give me speech.
Finish it.

2081
01:51:41,907 --> 01:51:43,227
Come on escape.
- Please.. please..

2082
01:51:43,467 --> 01:51:45,067
500mts away you will find our men.

2083
01:51:45,187 --> 01:51:46,947
They will help you
to reach your home safely.

2084
01:51:47,307 --> 01:51:48,067
What are you saying?

2085
01:51:48,547 --> 01:51:49,467
I am saying the truth.

2086
01:51:50,387 --> 01:51:50,907
Come on.

2087
01:51:51,587 --> 01:51:53,027
I am not believer in violence now.

2088
01:51:53,107 --> 01:51:54,227
I believe in love.

2089
01:51:54,307 --> 01:51:54,987
Are you joking?

2090
01:51:55,067 --> 01:51:56,867
No, come on run....

2091
01:51:57,787 --> 01:52:01,027
Hey, good bye Neha.

2092
01:52:02,387 --> 01:52:03,907
Don't look behind and see.

2093
01:52:11,827 --> 01:52:12,827
Bye..

2094
01:52:13,787 --> 01:52:16,907
You are welcome in this
special edition of news.

2095
01:52:16,987 --> 01:52:20,187
Harsh words took away D's life.

2096
01:52:20,507 --> 01:52:24,427
Today's breaking news
is that our star reporter..

2097
01:52:24,507 --> 01:52:29,507
..Arnab Ghosh has killed
dangerous Don D in his house.

2098
01:52:29,747 --> 01:52:31,827
There has been turmoil in the country.

2099
01:52:38,227 --> 01:52:40,067
You became a star overnight, baby.

2100
01:52:40,187 --> 01:52:43,227
I was born as a super star.
- You are right.

2101
01:52:44,467 --> 01:52:46,987
Okay, I wanted to tell you something.

2102
01:52:47,067 --> 01:52:48,027
Tell me.

2103
01:52:49,707 --> 01:52:52,187
You know this interview was
very tough and challenging for me.

2104
01:52:52,227 --> 01:52:53,067
You know it.

2105
01:52:54,427 --> 01:52:56,467
I had to accept many challenges.

2106
01:52:57,187 --> 01:52:58,187
I know.

2107
01:52:58,587 --> 01:53:00,387
I had to compromise.

2108
01:53:00,467 --> 01:53:01,907
I know.
- You don't know.

2109
01:53:06,587 --> 01:53:08,427
Are you telling me that
you have to compromise with D.

2110
01:53:08,507 --> 01:53:09,747
No, no not that bad.

2111
01:53:10,227 --> 01:53:11,747
Then anything else would do.

2112
01:53:11,827 --> 01:53:12,987
I don't think so.

2113
01:53:13,227 --> 01:53:14,387
What do you mean?

2114
01:53:15,627 --> 01:53:20,187
Actually I will have to
sleep with Neha for one night.

2115
01:53:24,307 --> 01:53:26,947
What do you mean you have
to sleep for one night with Neha?

2116
01:53:27,027 --> 01:53:28,227
Only one night.

2117
01:53:30,187 --> 01:53:32,027
What rubbish is that?
- Only one.

2118
01:53:33,227 --> 01:53:34,827
So you have guts to tell me this.

2119
01:53:35,027 --> 01:53:36,027
Not to.

2120
01:53:37,187 --> 01:53:38,787
You have a pregnant wife.

2121
01:53:41,107 --> 01:53:43,987
You are a rascal.
You are such a creep.

2122
01:53:45,187 --> 01:53:46,267
Say sorry.

2123
01:53:47,867 --> 01:53:48,867
Say sorry.

2124
01:53:49,187 --> 01:53:49,987
Sorry.

2125
01:53:50,067 --> 01:53:51,187
One more time.

2126
01:53:52,227 --> 01:53:53,107
Only one.

2127
01:53:53,307 --> 01:53:54,547
Sorry.

2128
01:53:55,307 --> 01:53:56,587
Only one time.

2129
01:53:57,427 --> 01:53:58,747
Say sorry.

2130
01:53:59,627 --> 01:54:01,467
Sorry.

2131
01:54:01,547 --> 01:54:03,787
You area such a creep.

2132
01:54:04,067 --> 01:54:06,827
Okay, okay I am going to the doctor.

2133
01:54:07,667 --> 01:54:08,627
That's it.

2134
01:54:08,707 --> 01:54:12,307
And listen celebration is due tonight.

2135
01:54:12,547 --> 01:54:15,987
If you are with me.
- Not bad.

2136
01:54:16,187 --> 01:54:18,867
Among so much crowd....

2137
01:54:19,307 --> 01:54:25,067
The biggest.. is being
offered to the country.

2138
01:54:25,667 --> 01:54:26,467
Hello.

2139
01:54:26,547 --> 01:54:29,827
Shall I call you brother
Arnab or senior editor Mr. Arnab.

2140
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:32,107
Hello.

2141
01:54:32,427 --> 01:54:35,267
I am saying greetings Mr. Arnab.

2142
01:54:38,347 --> 01:54:39,307
D.

2143
01:54:39,907 --> 01:54:42,747
To hell with D.

2144
01:54:43,347 --> 01:54:48,227
You are talking to
David Adrees Kalemen.

2145
01:54:49,267 --> 01:54:53,107
The time has come to do that thing
which we have been planning to do.

2146
01:54:53,747 --> 01:54:55,507
Brother, as you say.

2147
01:54:56,587 --> 01:54:59,347
I will do acting of
heart attack and fall.

2148
01:54:59,427 --> 01:55:00,467
Okay.

2149
01:55:00,827 --> 01:55:05,947
And you make them
reach India safely. Okay.

2150
01:55:06,027 --> 01:55:10,587
So that they can make the
news of my death as breaking news.

2151
01:55:11,027 --> 01:55:11,747
Okay brother.

2152
01:55:11,827 --> 01:55:14,067
And you will be free from this life.

2153
01:55:14,187 --> 01:55:19,947
Yes Girdhari.
I wanted to kill him on live TV

2154
01:55:20,467 --> 01:55:24,907
Then I thought there
is an opportunity and..

2155
01:55:24,987 --> 01:55:27,867
..why should I waste it
by committing a murder.

2156
01:55:27,947 --> 01:55:31,187
Or give birth to a new life for me.

2157
01:55:32,067 --> 01:55:32,987
Did you understand?

2158
01:55:34,427 --> 01:55:38,467
You did not even know and you
became a chess piece of D's chess.

2159
01:55:43,187 --> 01:55:47,507
Today I am going to
step into my new life.

2160
01:55:47,827 --> 01:55:49,307
It is because of your favor.

2161
01:55:49,627 --> 01:55:56,467
Do remember me if you want
a promotion or money?

2162
01:55:56,707 --> 01:55:57,987
I will not refuse you.

2163
01:56:02,707 --> 01:56:04,267
What are you doing?

2164
01:56:04,347 --> 01:56:06,587
Have you taken the shock to heart?

2165
01:56:08,107 --> 01:56:12,867
Sorry buddy.
I am trying not to laugh but...

2166
01:56:16,387 --> 01:56:19,347
Whom are you calling buddy?
Do you know whom are you talking to?

2167
01:56:20,427 --> 01:56:23,627
With David Adrees Kalemen.

2168
01:56:26,267 --> 01:56:32,787
Buddy, I have seen many amazing
and foolish people in my media career.

2169
01:56:33,027 --> 01:56:38,187
But you are too great.
You are above all.

2170
01:56:41,347 --> 01:56:43,787
Do you know what have you done today?

2171
01:56:43,867 --> 01:56:47,507
With your cunningness
you have done something..

2172
01:56:47,587 --> 01:56:51,027
..which international police
and intelligence could not do.

2173
01:56:51,307 --> 01:56:55,707
You killed D with your own hands today.

2174
01:56:57,107 --> 01:57:00,907
You think yourself to be a remote
control but you are actually..

2175
01:57:01,187 --> 01:57:05,227
..a useless remote control of a TV
which is also there in my house.

2176
01:57:06,507 --> 01:57:08,387
Your story is amazing.

2177
01:57:08,467 --> 01:57:14,427
You were born in India and
then you went to Dubai.

2178
01:57:14,507 --> 01:57:17,267
Then because of fear of Interpol
you escaped to Pakistan.

2179
01:57:17,347 --> 01:57:19,787
Then you got so scared
that you disappeared..

2180
01:57:19,867 --> 01:57:22,627
..not only from Pakistan
but from world map.

2181
01:57:23,907 --> 01:57:25,587
Great.

2182
01:57:25,827 --> 01:57:30,627
I have to say that everyone
is in love with his own identity..

2183
01:57:30,707 --> 01:57:34,707
..but you destroyed your identity.

2184
01:57:34,787 --> 01:57:36,427
Superb, buddy.

2185
01:57:37,507 --> 01:57:40,587
Honestly I am grateful to you.

2186
01:57:40,667 --> 01:57:43,947
You freed my country
from your hangover.

2187
01:57:44,027 --> 01:57:45,187
Total free.

2188
01:57:45,227 --> 01:57:49,827
Because of our police and intelligence
your fear had already disappeared.

2189
01:57:49,907 --> 01:57:54,627
But you finished the fear
of your name as well.

2190
01:57:54,707 --> 01:57:58,827
Superb. D, D is gone.

2191
01:57:58,907 --> 01:58:02,187
Look what amazing thing I did.

2192
01:58:02,467 --> 01:58:06,347
I am sure you must be standing in the..

2193
01:58:06,427 --> 01:58:09,707
..ticket line of an amusement
park wearing red hat.

2194
01:58:09,787 --> 01:58:14,107
But my stomach is twisting
because of laughter.

2195
01:58:15,987 --> 01:58:19,747
Now I will take your leave.
I will keep the phone.

2196
01:58:19,827 --> 01:58:22,107
Okay. But one minute.

2197
01:58:22,347 --> 01:58:24,947
Do you know what date is today?
15th August.

2198
01:58:25,027 --> 01:58:29,747
No one must have thought that today you
will free us from yourself.

2199
01:58:31,547 --> 01:58:34,947
Now I have an important
meeting with real people.

2200
01:58:36,707 --> 01:58:38,187
Thanks for calling.

2201
01:58:39,667 --> 01:58:42,507
Hello, hello.....

2202
01:58:47,107 --> 01:58:50,547
Brother, he is asking for change.

2203
01:58:53,227 --> 01:58:55,267
Always keep change. Understood.

2204
01:58:55,547 --> 01:58:56,747
Do you know who I am?

2205
01:58:56,827 --> 01:58:57,987
D

2206
01:58:59,387 --> 01:59:00,547
Come on brother.

2207
01:59:00,627 --> 01:59:02,987
From the time he has dies
everyone think of themselves as D.

2208
01:59:03,067 --> 01:59:06,027
Look there.
Upcoming movie Coffee With D

2209
01:59:06,947 --> 01:59:08,187
Brother...

2210
01:59:08,907 --> 01:59:09,987
You come, please.
