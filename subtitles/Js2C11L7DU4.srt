1
00:02:49,578 --> 00:02:50,738
I am dead!

2
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:52,857
I am dead!

3
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:55,098
I am dead!

4
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:56,778
Don't hit me!

5
00:02:56,858 --> 00:02:57,938
You won't listen otherwise!

6
00:02:58,018 --> 00:02:59,243
This is your punishment!

7
00:02:59,323 --> 00:03:01,458
I won't make a mistake again, madam!

8
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:02,508
Don't hit me!

9
00:03:02,588 --> 00:03:03,778
Idiot!

10
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:06,505
You broke my chandelier
worth 10,000!

11
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:09,658
Who will pay for the damages?

12
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:10,768
Answer me!

13
00:03:10,913 --> 00:03:12,458
Secretary!
- Yes madam!

14
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,178
Deduct the damage costs every
month from his salary!

15
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,818
But madam!
- But what?

16
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:20,938
This man has been kept on
a 15 days trial basis!

17
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:22,618
His salary has not been fixed!

18
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:25,698
Then fix it, and deduct
the costs from it!

19
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:28,340
I will fix it and..
- You shut up!

20
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,458
Shut up!

21
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:31,587
Secretary, please keep quiet!

22
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:34,029
All of you listen carefully!

23
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:37,554
If anyone makes a mistake,
or does such a damage.

24
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,658
Then I will teach him a lesson!

25
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:41,298
Secretary!
- It hasn't been fixed.

26
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:42,951
Shut up and follow me!

27
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:44,298
Definitely! Definitely!

28
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:49,944
"Heartless,
gave me so much pain.."

29
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:55,235
"..without knowing
how delicate my heart is.."

30
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:01,486
"This cruel world.."

31
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:11,658
Bravo Saigal sir.

32
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:17,795
"This cruel world.."

33
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:26,469
I am fed up of your tape.

34
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:28,218
I am standing here!

35
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:32,298
You always listen to
such ancient songs.

36
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:33,658
What has happened to you?

37
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:35,058
Why didn't you drink this milk?

38
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:37,218
Milk! What milk?
- This milk!

39
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:39,138
It was very hot.

40
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:40,378
So I thought once it cools down..

41
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,378
Whether it is hot or cold,
you will have to drink it.

42
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,058
Come on, give him the milk.
- Yes madam.

43
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:47,618
The servants have other work too.

44
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:51,298
They don't have time to listen
to the tape like you.

45
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:52,458
Quickly drink the milk.

46
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:54,898
You have work too.

47
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:57,458
I stopped drinking milk
in my childhood..

48
00:04:57,538 --> 00:04:58,940
..why are you giving me again?

49
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,982
Madam's orders.

50
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:01,458
What does your madam care?

51
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:04,218
First she gives me milk, then
eggs and then thrashes me.

52
00:05:04,863 --> 00:05:06,698
Do one thing, you drink this milk.

53
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:09,032
Me!
- Yes. - How can I drink this milk?

54
00:05:09,112 --> 00:05:10,578
From your mouth, how else?

55
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:12,778
Here, keep these pills too.

56
00:05:12,935 --> 00:05:13,618
Drink it.

57
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,098
Bravo, drink it.

58
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:28,618
1!

59
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:31,058
2!

60
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:14,098
Brother Suraj!
- Yes!

61
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:16,778
Why are you gasping?

62
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:19,298
Nothing, I was just jogging.

63
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,898
The neighbour's dog
was scared seeing me.

64
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:24,810
And so he ran ahead
and I was behind him.

65
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,758
So I am gasping.

66
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:29,098
Okay!

67
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,298
So you mean,
you were exercising..

68
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:33,258
..and the dog came after you.

69
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:34,532
That's what I am saying.

70
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:35,618
I am telling the same thing.

71
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,178
But are you giving me
morning tea or not?

72
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:40,018
Why not, surely I will.

73
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:42,298
But this is a special tea.

74
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:45,298
Okay, so this is Mr. Vicky's tea.

75
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:46,778
It is so strange brother.

76
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:49,178
Until he doesn't drink the
tea prepared by me..

77
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:50,458
..he doesn't wake up.

78
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:53,458
He wakes up only listening
to disco and pop music.

79
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:57,018
But you are fulfilling your duty
by mixing your love in this tea.

80
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:00,558
But just see that useless,
does he care at all.

81
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:02,508
Heard that!

82
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:03,998
Now he will wake up!

83
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:04,758
Go!

84
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:06,696
Fulfill your duty, go.

85
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:40,462
Vicky!

86
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:43,478
Vicky!

87
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:51,734
Aarti you!

88
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,218
Why did you switch off the music?

89
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:55,429
First drink the tea, then
you can dance all you want.

90
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:57,458
Why do you come to disturb
me every morning?

91
00:07:57,538 --> 00:07:58,466
Why do you bring tea
for me every morning?

92
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,765
Because I like doing things for you.

93
00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:02,816
After all,
we are childhood friends.

94
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,738
Aarti, I am fed up of you!

95
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,418
We are no more children,
we have grown up!

96
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:09,658
The feelings of a person
doesn't change..

97
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:10,978
..when they grow up.

98
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:14,298
This girl won't understand.
Keep the tea!

99
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:15,521
Keep the tea!

100
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:16,898
Go! Go!

101
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:30,359
What are you saying Mrs. Poonawala.

102
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,098
That's just like darkness
under the lamp.

103
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:38,218
Just see, you are searching for
a groom for your daughters.

104
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:40,243
And I am looking for
girls for my son.

105
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,458
And both of us are looking
here and there.

106
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:45,298
Yes, yes for my son Suraj.

107
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:46,898
Do one thing.

108
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:48,698
Come home at 5 o'clock in
the evening for tea..

109
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:51,018
..along with your daughters.

110
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,018
This way, the children will
see each other too.

111
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:57,538
Okay then, see you
at 5 o'clock. Bye.

112
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,258
May I come in madam?
- Come in.

113
00:09:01,878 --> 00:09:04,398
Good morning madam.
- Good morning.

114
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:08,608
Secretary, today at 5 o'clock my
best friend is coming for tea.

115
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:09,778
Along with her daughters.

116
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:11,260
To fix the alliance.

117
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,258
Be ready and..
- It's very nice of you madam.

118
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:16,458
There are very few women
like you in our country.

119
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,458
5 years after my wife died,
you thought about me.

120
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:22,778
Shut up you fool!
- Why shut up madam.

121
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:25,778
They are coming for Suraj.
- Oh! My fault! I am sorry!

122
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:26,785
Secretary.
- Yes.

123
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:30,378
Cancel all the appointments
that are in the afternoon!

124
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,722
How is that possible madam?

125
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:33,818
Today afternoon you have
to go to the widow home..

126
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:37,088
Secretary, do as I say!
- Yes.

127
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,618
Because today's tea party
is more important for me.

128
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:41,874
No arguments go home and make
all the arrangements.

129
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:42,938
Diary closed.

130
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:44,578
Come, come.

131
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,538
Come.

132
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,678
Miscreant, fell asleep standing.

133
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,798
There is always a party
in this house.

134
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:58,298
But today's party is very
important for madam.

135
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:01,537
Her son's alliance is
about to be fixed.

136
00:10:01,618 --> 00:10:04,205
None of you should make a mistake.

137
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:06,153
If anyone of you makes a mistake..

138
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:08,779
..then I will be court-marshaled
along with you..

139
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,696
Secretary!
- Madam, good morning.

140
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,637
Good afternoon!
- Oh, good afternoon.

141
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:14,762
Have you explained them properly?

142
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:15,727
I was just doing that, madam.

143
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:18,058
If anyone makes a mistake.

144
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:22,503
Then I will flog him,
where is your uniform.

145
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:23,949
Madam, my child urinated on it.

146
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:27,559
Shut up!
Go and change your uniform!

147
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:28,978
Secretary, explain him!

148
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:30,138
I will explain him, madam.

149
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:32,498
Stupid, quickly go and
change your uniform.

150
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:34,778
Or else, you will also
do what your child did.

151
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:35,978
Correct.

152
00:10:37,924 --> 00:10:39,698
Greetings mummy.
- What is this nonsense?

153
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:42,458
Even the servants of this
house speak English.

154
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:47,537
And even after doing M.A, you are
still stuck up in ancient era.

155
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:49,938
Greetings mother! Greetings father!

156
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,178
What is all this?

157
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:55,229
Look, if you want to live
in today's society..

158
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:57,258
..then learn its etiquette too!

159
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,498
And what are you wearing?

160
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:04,338
I want to see you well dressed,
up to date, but..

161
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,178
Mummy, a man's character is
reflected from his behaviour..

162
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:09,338
..and not his clothes.

163
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:13,641
Wow! What great thoughts.

164
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:16,618
Instead of taking birth in this
family, you should have..

165
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:18,978
Been born in a respected family.

166
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:21,319
Mr. Bhandari.
- Yes.

167
00:11:21,456 --> 00:11:26,247
When I am talking to my son,
please don't interfere!

168
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:28,030
I know that he is your son..

169
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,658
..but co-incidentally I am his
father too. - Keep quiet!

170
00:11:31,738 --> 00:11:33,858
I have been quiet right
from my marriage.

171
00:11:34,168 --> 00:11:35,187
What was I saying?

172
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:36,418
I don't know.

173
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:39,498
I was saying, Suraj today
evening Mr. Poonawala..

174
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:42,898
..is coming for tea along
with her three daughters.

175
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:44,178
Really!

176
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:45,840
But why?

177
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:49,967
Because she is searching for
a groom for her daughters.

178
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:52,509
So, will he marry all
those three girls?

179
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,589
Mr. Bhandari again you..
- Good afternoon everybody.

180
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,252
Hi! Hi mom!

181
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:58,029
Hi dad!

182
00:11:58,589 --> 00:11:59,669
Hi brother, how are you?

183
00:12:00,232 --> 00:12:02,116
You are looking so
smart and handsome!

184
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:03,210
Where are you going?

185
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,060
There is a tennis match
in the college.

186
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,453
I am getting late, mom.
- Wish you all the best! - See you.

187
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:08,469
Bye.

188
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,669
By dad.
- Bye.

189
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:12,229
Did you see your younger brother?

190
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:14,561
He is so smart and mod.
- A lot.

191
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:16,798
I had dreamt the same
things about you, but..

192
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:19,868
Yes, the dreams she had seen
for me, those are shattered.

193
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,229
Now she wants to make
you the scapegoat.

194
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:23,207
Mr. Bhandari, I told you..
- I am sorry.

195
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:24,589
Suraj!
- There.

196
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:26,509
Please keep quiet!
- Alright.

197
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:29,069
Suraj, guests are arriving
in the evening.

198
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:31,069
Before that, you will
come in my room.

199
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:34,589
Because I will select
your dress, understood.

200
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,029
Mummy, I will..
- No arguments, that's all!

201
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:41,749
Father..
- No arguments.

202
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:43,778
There is no place for arguments
in this government.

203
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:44,749
Didn't you hear? Go!

204
00:12:44,988 --> 00:12:46,229
This government has to change.

205
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:47,629
First you change you clothes.

206
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:53,549
Gopi.
- Yes madam.

207
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,749
I am getting Suraj ready.

208
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:59,349
Inform me as soon as Mr. and
Mrs. Poonawala arrive.

209
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:00,309
Go.

210
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:02,989
No good.

211
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:06,389
O yes! This is the colour.

212
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:09,829
Wear this Suraj you will
look very cute in this.

213
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,309
What a beautiful colour!

214
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:12,509
Mummy.
- I like this.

215
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:14,829
Mummy, you are treating
me like a child.

216
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:16,909
Can't I..
- Will you keep quiet?

217
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:18,829
Do as I say!

218
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,069
They will be arriving.

219
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:21,869
Come on wear this, no arguments.

220
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,509
Thank you.

221
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:26,389
Come, come Mrs. Chunawala.

222
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:28,909
Oh no Mr. Bhandari.

223
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:31,229
How many times have I told you!

224
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:33,909
I am Mrs. Poonawala
and not Chunawala.

225
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:38,642
It is so, rose called by any
other name is still rose.

226
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,057
It won't turn into a cauliflower.

227
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:40,881
What?

228
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:42,244
I didn't understand what you meant!

229
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:46,509
You will not understand,
your husband would have.

230
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,149
I say, your husband is so fortunate.

231
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:52,469
He got such a lovely wife like you.

232
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,061
You are married.

233
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:59,149
But you don't look like you are
a mother of three children.

234
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:01,829
Thank you very much
for the compliment.

235
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,244
You have maintained
your figure so well.

236
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:04,149
So nice.

237
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:05,989
Tell the secret to my wife too.

238
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:07,858
Her waistline is increasing.

239
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:09,069
Mr. Bhandari.

240
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,709
Come, come you have
a very long life.

241
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,029
We were just talking about you.

242
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:15,109
There is a call for you, please go.

243
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:18,509
No, there is always a call
for me at such occasions.

244
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,749
Forgive me Mrs. Chuanawala..
Kathawala!

245
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:24,469
No, no Tambakuwala..
- Poonawala.

246
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:25,427
What difference does it make?

247
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:27,923
Rose flower, cauliflower,
did it make any difference.

248
00:14:28,003 --> 00:14:30,429
Mr. Bhandari!
- Yes, I am leaving.

249
00:14:32,183 --> 00:14:37,303
Mrs. Bhandari, your husband
is so interesting.

250
00:14:37,383 --> 00:14:41,090
He talks so well, how sweet of him.

251
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,429
Mrs. Poonawala, Thank you very much.

252
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,824
This is my son, Suraj Bhandari, M.A.

253
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,029
Greetings aunt.
- Greetings.

254
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:51,509
Son, these are my daughters.

255
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:53,069
Anita.
- Hi.

256
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:54,909
And she is Vanita.
- Hello.

257
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:57,429
And this is Sunita.
- Hi.

258
00:14:57,686 --> 00:15:00,789
I have come for her alliance.
- O, I see.

259
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:02,589
Aunt, if you don't mind.

260
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:04,149
Can I see your bungalow
along with Suraj?

261
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:05,309
Why not?

262
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:06,789
There is no need to ask for that.

263
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:09,709
Suraj, show her our bungalow.

264
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:12,108
But mummy, there is nothing
to show.. - Come on.

265
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:13,069
Come on.

266
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:16,509
Listen, bring tea, coffee, cold
drinks and something to eat.

267
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:17,589
Yes madam!
- Go!

268
00:15:19,014 --> 00:15:20,029
Mrs. Bhandari.

269
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:23,509
The pair of your Suraj and my
Sunita will be very nice.

270
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,749
Come.

271
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:26,669
Seeing the house is
just an pretence.

272
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:29,176
What is your opinion about me?

273
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:30,989
Very nice, but first see the house.

274
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:33,589
These long stairs,
they go to the sky.

275
00:15:33,885 --> 00:15:35,029
And my mummy's bedroom is there.

276
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:37,389
And down there is
my daddy's bedroom.

277
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:38,589
These stairs lead that way.

278
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:40,149
Really?
- Yes.

279
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:43,083
But where is your bedroom?

280
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:44,469
I am stuck in the middle.

281
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:45,669
Come on.

282
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:50,029
Mrs. Poonawala, I don't have any
objection to this alliance.

283
00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:53,069
But all of this depends
on Mr. Bhandari.

284
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:57,509
Last week, Mr. Bhandari had come
with her daughter's hand.

285
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:01,469
And he has promised to give
lakhs of rupees in dowry.

286
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:03,669
Just say yes to this alliance.

287
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:07,029
We will give so much
to Mr. Bhandari.

288
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:09,709
He will be fed up of counting it.

289
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:11,914
There you are, so sweet.

290
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:15,361
And the both of us will teach
them such a lesson..

291
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,844
..they will never forget.

292
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:19,758
I am against taking dowry.

293
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:21,709
But now that you are forcing me.

294
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:23,729
I cannot hurt you.

295
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:26,409
We are not giving anything to you.

296
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:28,580
We are giving our daughter.

297
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:31,169
And this is our cold water fountain.

298
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:32,488
Very beautiful.

299
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:34,149
And this is its cold water.

300
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:36,309
And this is our ancestral cheetah.

301
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,109
Is it alive?

302
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:39,429
No, it died seeing our mummy.

303
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:42,027
And our mummy had brought
this whip as dowry.

304
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,229
Come on.

305
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:49,429
Mrs. Bhandari, see a good
date and inform us.

306
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:51,869
We will complete the ritual
of the engagement.

307
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:55,829
You are very, very interesting
person Mrs. Poonawala.

308
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,629
Thank you very much
Mrs. Bhandari.

309
00:17:00,315 --> 00:17:01,669
This is my bedroom.

310
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:04,069
Bedroom!
- Yes!

311
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:07,814
Wow! Lovely.

312
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:13,029
Our bedroom is so nice.

313
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,149
Our bedroom!
- Yes.

314
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:19,509
Our mummy is fixing our alliance.

315
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,509
There is a pain in my head
so I suddenly remembered..

316
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,949
..that I have a bad eyesight.

317
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:27,149
So I have to go to the doctor
to have my eyesight checked.

318
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:30,219
If I miss this, then it will
be delayed for a month.

319
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,589
Because the doctor is suddenly
going to America.

320
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:33,389
So you rest in my bedroom.
- Okay.

321
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,669
I will just come.

322
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:35,829
Listen to me.

323
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:40,589
Chunawala!

324
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:42,229
I knew that you will be shocked.

325
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:44,509
Its fine son, get married.

326
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:46,429
You will become a millionaire.

327
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:48,347
To hell with such money father.

328
00:17:48,427 --> 00:17:49,589
I don't want such money.

329
00:17:49,848 --> 00:17:52,429
Father, I want a simple girl.

330
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:54,082
Someone who can take care of me.

331
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,029
Who can share my happiness
and sorrows!

332
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:57,749
Can understand my emotions.

333
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,669
Son, if you want such a wife.

334
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:05,311
I feel you won't find her
in this life. - Why?

335
00:18:05,428 --> 00:18:06,469
Because your mother won't allow..

336
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:07,811
..such a daughter-in-law
in this house.

337
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:09,909
There aren't such daughter-in-law's
in modern families.

338
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,509
I feel so suffocated here.

339
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:13,429
I don't know how you have
been tolerating..

340
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,829
..this modern house for so long.

341
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:18,669
For that you need a
very strong heart.

342
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:23,449
And son, the tolerance that
you always talk about.

343
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,109
I will tell you.

344
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,909
My father was a very poor man.

345
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:37,549
And I had a very peasant job in
your mother's father's office.

346
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:40,709
Seeing my honesty and sincerity.

347
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:43,269
He married his daughter to me.

348
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:46,509
Thinking that I will show his
daughter the right path.

349
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,349
But I was a very sincere
and simple person.

350
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,309
I couldn't bring her
on the right path.

351
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,909
But she brought me in this house
as a live in son-in-law.

352
00:18:58,331 --> 00:19:04,509
Then.. instead of a husband
I was more like her slave!

353
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:06,069
Father.

354
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:09,069
Anyway, it is our fate.

355
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:11,452
You feel suffocated, isn't it?

356
00:19:11,532 --> 00:19:13,949
Do one thing, go to
some hill station

357
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,116
Lakhanpur is close-by.

358
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:16,523
A friend of mine stays there

359
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,130
Lakhanpur, please alight.

360
00:19:57,639 --> 00:19:59,930
Alight quickly, we have
to get down too.

361
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:02,170
It is too late.

362
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:03,855
In the front.

363
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:05,530
Come on, let us have tea Ramesh.

364
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:15,570
Listen brother.
- Yes, what is it?

365
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,730
Which way is the guest house.
- That side.

366
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,130
There.
- Yes, on the left.

367
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,330
Thank you.

368
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,250
"I am a betel leaf seller."

369
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:55,170
"Without a shop."

370
00:20:56,196 --> 00:21:01,988
"The entire village
eats my betel leaf."

371
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,450
"Whether it is Delhi or Chennai."

372
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:10,470
"Or whether it is
Mumbai or Kolkata."

373
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:16,370
"This green leaf is the antidote
for all the ailments."

374
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,010

00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:24,690
"Mister, have a betel leaf."

377
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:28,250
"My betel leaf is very nice."

378
00:21:28,636 --> 00:21:31,250
"My betel leaf.."

379
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,276
"My betel leaf is famous
all over India."

380
00:21:36,356 --> 00:21:37,330
"Hey mister."

381
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:38,570
"Hey sir."

382
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,064
"Boy, have a betel leaf."

383
00:21:42,144 --> 00:21:44,890
"My betel leaf is very nice."

384
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,846
"Mister, have a betel leaf."

385
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:51,450
"My betel leaf is very nice."

386
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,010
"After eating it,
there is redness on the lips."

387
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,250
"And a glow on the face."

388
00:22:23,746 --> 00:22:26,868
"After eating it,
there is redness on the lips."

389
00:22:26,948 --> 00:22:29,784
"And a glow on the face."

390
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:32,850
"Have a betel leaf."

391
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,170
"Your wife will be floored."

392
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:41,370
"A gentle smile will solve
all your problems."

393
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,299
"Mister, have a betel leaf."

394
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:47,276
"My betel leaf is very nice."

395
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:50,228
"Mister, have a betel leaf."

396
00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:53,850
"My betel leaf is very nice."

397
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:26,208
"If you want to appease
your beloved."

398
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:30,330
"You want to fix your
broken alliance."

399
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:35,410
"If you want to appease
your beloved."

400
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,450
"You want to fix your
broken alliance."

401
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,250
"Take this betel leaf along."

402
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,250
"Everything will be right."

403
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,170
"The youngsters, children and
old are fan of my betel leaf."

00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,010
"Mister, have a betel leaf."

407
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:01,570
"My betel leaf is very nice."

408
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:27,090
"Whether it is a jamboree."

409
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,850
"Or singing or dancing."

410
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,876
"Whether it is a jamboree."

411
00:24:32,956 --> 00:24:34,650
"Or singing or dancing."

412
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:37,450
"Or singing or dancing."

413
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:40,450
"Eat a betel leaf."

414
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,547
"And entice the entire jamboree."

415
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,240
"Every jamboree is incomplete
without a betel leaf."

416
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,130
"Mister, have a betel leaf."

417
00:24:51,317 --> 00:24:54,690
"My betel leaf is very nice."

418
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,690
"My betel leaf is famous
all over India."

419
00:24:59,927 --> 00:25:00,890
"Hey mister."

420
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:02,330
"Hey sir."

421
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:05,800
"Boy, have a betel leaf."

422
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,511
"My betel leaf is very nice."

423
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,250
"Mister, have a betel leaf."

424
00:25:11,382 --> 00:25:15,090
"My betel leaf is very nice."

425
00:25:31,969 --> 00:25:40,330
1.. 2.. 3.. 4 and 5!

426
00:25:41,785 --> 00:25:42,810
What is it mister?

427
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,010
Do you want a betel leaf?

428
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:47,010
Yes, I want a betel leaf!

429
00:25:47,366 --> 00:25:48,450
Then take it.

430
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:50,825
Take it.

431
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,090
What are you staring at?

432
00:25:56,423 --> 00:25:58,307
Haven't you seen a girl before?

433
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,250
I have, why won't I?

434
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,170
But not in this form.

435
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,090
Do you come here
to sell betel leaf?

436
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,930
No, no I just arrived
here few days ago.

437
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,090
To visit my uncle.

438
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:14,610
This mobile betel leaf shop is
not Shalu's, but her uncles'.

439
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,450
He is ill today, that's
why I brought it.

440
00:26:17,382 --> 00:26:18,330
Fine.

441
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,330
You sing very well.

442
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,386
No sir, I sing because these
days everything is sold..

443
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:26,730
..while singing.

444
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:30,330
You have to take trouble to
allure the customers, mister.

445
00:26:31,346 --> 00:26:32,850
Have you come from the city?

446
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:34,250
Yes, I just arrived.

447
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:36,330
The guest house..

448
00:26:36,584 --> 00:26:37,770
Where is the guest house here?

449
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,490
There it is.

450
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,090
That one.
- Yes.

451
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:46,570
How much for your betel leaf, Shalu?

452
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,599
No mister. Today you
are a guest here.

453
00:26:49,762 --> 00:26:51,130
I won't take money from you.

454
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:53,330
It is not the tradition to
take money from the guest.

455
00:26:53,531 --> 00:26:54,290
If you take betel leaf tomorrow..

456
00:26:54,427 --> 00:26:55,856
..then I will take money first.

457
00:26:57,223 --> 00:26:58,530
Fine.
- Okay.

458
00:26:58,815 --> 00:26:59,930
Thank you.
- Bye.

459
00:27:10,424 --> 00:27:12,890
Watchman! Watchman!

460
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,090
Coming sir.

461
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:16,050
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

462
00:27:16,314 --> 00:27:18,290
Is there a room available
in your guesthouse?

463
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,998
Room! Sir, the entire
guesthouse is empty.

464
00:27:21,078 --> 00:27:22,490
Give me the luggage.
- Come sir, come.

465
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,370
Come, come.

466
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,930
Come, come.

467
00:27:25,683 --> 00:27:26,730
Jaggu dada is here!

468
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,930
Jaggu dada is here!

469
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,090
Jaggu dada is here!

470
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,616
Run!

471
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:37,478
Hey, run!

472
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,103
Run for your lives!

473
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,690
Mister, just wait.

474
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:48,570
What is it?

475
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,330
Has someone
died in the village?

476
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,812
Donations are being collected.

477
00:28:51,892 --> 00:28:53,210
Keep quiet, speak softly.

478
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:54,930
If Jaggu dada hears you.

479
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:56,250
Then he won't spare you.

480
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,690
Jaggu dada, why?

481
00:28:57,971 --> 00:29:00,810
He comes here every week,
and collects money.

482
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,130
Everyone has to put something
in that cap.

483
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,689
And the one that doesn't,
he doesn't spare him.

484
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:06,285
Is that so?

485
00:29:06,365 --> 00:29:08,730
Listen to me, and put
something in that cap.

486
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:10,128
Otherwise he
will not spare you..

487
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,930
..and smash your betel
leaf shop too.

488
00:29:12,277 --> 00:29:13,954
Understood.
- Yes, I understood.

489
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:15,450
You go!
- Okay!

490
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,810
Which scoundrel did this?

491
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:03,250
I don't know Jaggu dada!
I don't know!

492
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:04,410
I don't know Jaggu dada!
I don't know!

493
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,694
I don't know!

494
00:30:05,774 --> 00:30:07,897
Tell me, who did this?

495
00:30:07,977 --> 00:30:09,832
I don't know Jaggu dada!
I don't know! - Tell me!

496
00:30:09,912 --> 00:30:11,330
I don't know! I don't know!

497
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:13,453
I don't know! I don't know!
- Tell me!

498
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:15,982
I will beat you to a pulp!

499
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:16,930
You don't know.

500
00:30:17,626 --> 00:30:19,250
Hey, I am dead. I am dead.

501
00:30:26,016 --> 00:30:30,610
Jaggu dada,
why are you asking that weakling.

502
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,330
I have done this.

503
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:36,330
Really, you have done this.

504
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:37,610
What is your name?

505
00:30:37,854 --> 00:30:39,370
My name is Shalu.

506
00:30:39,622 --> 00:30:40,650
Shalu!

507
00:30:41,445 --> 00:30:42,650
Shalu!

508
00:30:45,448 --> 00:30:46,530
Here!

509
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,610
Where will you go!

510
00:31:18,694 --> 00:31:20,074
No one should cast an evil eye.

511
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,487
Quiet!

512
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,316
Shalu, where will you go!

513
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:33,850
You!

514
00:32:55,618 --> 00:32:56,816
Thrash him!

515
00:32:56,896 --> 00:32:58,584
Thrash him!

516
00:33:05,768 --> 00:33:07,370
Leave me!

517
00:33:07,883 --> 00:33:09,490
Leave me!

518
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:10,810
I will not spare anyone!

519
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,566
Hit him!

520
00:33:16,014 --> 00:33:17,210
Hit him!

521
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,732
Hit him, smash him.

522
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:22,745
Hit him!

523
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,650
Here sister, adorn him.

524
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:27,782
O wow, this is absolutely
an original garland.

525
00:33:28,153 --> 00:33:29,216
I'll be right back.

526
00:33:29,997 --> 00:33:32,316
Move! Move! Move! Move!

527
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,919
Get up! Get up!

528
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:41,023
Forgive me!

529
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,118
If you ever come to
this village again.

530
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:47,311
Then I will beat you to a pulp.

531
00:33:47,391 --> 00:33:49,276
What?
- Beat me to a pulp.

532
00:33:49,356 --> 00:33:50,471
Yes! Run!

533
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,341
Run!

534
00:33:57,022 --> 00:34:00,631
Great Shalu, you taught
that goon a nice lesson.

535
00:34:00,871 --> 00:34:02,363
Look at how he ran.

536
00:34:02,443 --> 00:34:04,161
He must have learned his lesson!

537
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:05,335
He would bother us everyday.

538
00:34:05,447 --> 00:34:09,303
Now he will never come
to this village again.

539
00:34:09,558 --> 00:34:11,224
Live peacefully.

540
00:34:11,431 --> 00:34:13,399
May God bless you!

541
00:34:16,174 --> 00:34:18,055
Shalu, you were really great.

542
00:34:18,142 --> 00:34:21,440
You taught a nice lesson
to that strong goon.

543
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:24,351
Mister, this was a
very small example.

544
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:25,951
Whoever has locked
horns with Shalu..

545
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,031
..she has always taught
him a lesson like this.

546
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:30,831
Oh yes, did you get a room
in the guest house?

547
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:31,831
Yes I did.

548
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:34,191
Bye then.

549
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,471
Suraj has crossed all limits.

550
00:34:41,694 --> 00:34:43,396
He has been missing from
home since yesterday.

551
00:34:43,476 --> 00:34:44,661
Without informing!

552
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:45,729
Do you know anything?

553
00:34:45,843 --> 00:34:48,822
No.. maybe he went with
his friends for a picnic.

554
00:34:48,902 --> 00:34:50,231
With whose permission?

555
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:52,823
Only your permission is
followed in this house.

556
00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:54,524
But if you..
- Keep quiet, please!

557
00:34:54,604 --> 00:34:55,991
Secretary.
- Yes madam.

558
00:34:56,245 --> 00:34:57,685
What are you looking at?

559
00:34:57,765 --> 00:34:59,006
Quickly take the car out and go!

560
00:34:59,086 --> 00:34:59,649
I understood!

561
00:34:59,729 --> 00:35:01,562
Go and search for Suraj sir,
and bring him before you..

562
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:02,363
..either dead or alive.

563
00:35:02,443 --> 00:35:03,242
Shut up!

564
00:35:03,373 --> 00:35:05,805
Understand the situation
before speaking!

565
00:35:05,885 --> 00:35:07,405
Go and search for him, shut up.

566
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:09,085
Yes madam! Sorry.

567
00:35:10,749 --> 00:35:11,794
Shall I keep seated
or shall I get up?

568
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:13,725
Keep seated!
- Thank you!

569
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:17,925
This boy has really troubled me.

570
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:19,965
If Suraj is not found by evening..

571
00:35:20,045 --> 00:35:23,645
..then what will I tell
Mrs. Poonawala.

572
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:27,205
Mrs. Chunawala..
- Mrs. Poonawala, not Chunawala.

573
00:35:27,285 --> 00:35:28,485
Yes, slip of tongue.

574
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:32,805
I will explain to Mrs. Chunawala..
no, Mrs. Poonawala nicely.

575
00:35:32,885 --> 00:35:34,365
Mr. Bhandari!

576
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:37,825
Don't try to be too
free with my friends!

577
00:35:37,905 --> 00:35:39,005
You know my nature.

578
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:41,298
What else do I know in this
world other than your nature?

579
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:44,456
Then listen one thing carefully.
- Yes.

580
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:48,327
My son should be here
within 24 hours!

581
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:51,307
Look that depends on the Lord.

582
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:53,942
But as far as 24 hours are
concerned, that's impossible.

583
00:35:54,101 --> 00:35:55,673
You need at least 9 months for that.

584
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,269
Mr. Bhandari! - Slowly, or oil
will sprout out from earth.

585
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:00,999
My head is about to explode!

586
00:36:03,502 --> 00:36:05,153
Do you need an atom bomb?

587
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:05,708
No, isn't it?

588
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,693
She is enough to blast
the entire world.

589
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,128
Think what my condition is.

590
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:10,893
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

591
00:36:10,973 --> 00:36:12,213
I have brought tea for you.

592
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:13,693
Bring it, I need tea.

593
00:36:13,773 --> 00:36:17,853
Tell me sir, did you face any
difficulty in the night?

594
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:19,813
And did you sleep peacefully?

595
00:36:20,464 --> 00:36:21,213
I slept very peacefully.

596
00:36:21,694 --> 00:36:25,333
Really sir!
- And I saw very nice dreams.

597
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:26,413
Dreams!

598
00:36:28,494 --> 00:36:31,213
Watchman! The first thing that I
sighted entering this village..

599
00:36:31,293 --> 00:36:35,394
..her name is Shalu.

600
00:36:37,522 --> 00:36:38,453
What a beautiful face!

601
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,013
What melodious voice!

602
00:36:41,773 --> 00:36:43,533
She talks nicely too!

603
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:45,773
And she is so brave!

604
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:52,573
Sir, it is so great if 1 girl has
so many qualities. - Isn't it?

605
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:56,613
And watchman, I have been dreaming
about her the entire night.

606
00:36:56,786 --> 00:36:57,453
Really!

607
00:36:57,533 --> 00:36:59,373
That's why you are looking so happy.

608
00:36:59,453 --> 00:37:01,853
Sir, where does that girl live?

609
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,213
Even I don't know that!

610
00:37:03,293 --> 00:37:05,613
I was thinking about asking you.

611
00:37:05,693 --> 00:37:08,293
What does her parents do,
where does she live?

612
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:10,733
Sir, I will find that out.
- Yes!

613
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:12,780
Sir! Sir!

614
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,173
Hide me somewhere, sir!

615
00:37:14,343 --> 00:37:15,587
Hide me somewhere!

616
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:16,654
What is the matter, Shalu?

617
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,557
Why are you so scared?

618
00:37:17,637 --> 00:37:19,773
What shall I tell you,
this is what you say..

619
00:37:19,853 --> 00:37:22,133
..l didn't do anything
and fell into trouble.

620
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,457
Yesterday I had thrashed that goon.
- Yes.

621
00:37:24,537 --> 00:37:27,213
Today he has come with his goons.

622
00:37:27,293 --> 00:37:28,533
And Shalu is in trouble.

623
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,093
He might come here too.

624
00:37:30,173 --> 00:37:31,381
Hide me somewhere!

625
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:32,293
Why are you worried, I am there!

626
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:34,573
I will take care of everything.
- Yes.

627
00:37:34,909 --> 00:37:37,213
You will take care of everything!
- Yes, of course I will.

628
00:37:37,293 --> 00:37:39,853
Mister, then may your children
have a long life.

629
00:37:40,773 --> 00:37:43,933
For your information I must tell
you, I don't have children!

630
00:37:44,493 --> 00:37:46,853
Why, you couldn't have them.

631
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:47,893
Of course I would have.

632
00:37:48,255 --> 00:37:50,093
If I would have been married.

633
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:52,973
You are not married.

634
00:37:53,724 --> 00:37:54,973
I am unmarried too.

635
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:56,693
You are not married!

636
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,533
Then I am happier to meet you!

637
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:00,573
Yes!

638
00:38:00,813 --> 00:38:02,630
Watchman, Shalu has come.

639
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,733
Go bring tea for her!

640
00:38:03,813 --> 00:38:05,293
I will just bring it sir.
-Please come.

641
00:38:07,316 --> 00:38:08,551
Why are you turning back,
no one will come.

642
00:38:08,631 --> 00:38:09,813
Come, come.

643
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:13,613
Sit on the sofa, not down there.

644
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:15,653
Here.
- Then, what is this sofa for.

645
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:18,333
Sit, sit.

646
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:23,173
Shall I tell you one thing, mister?
- Yes.

647
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:27,773
You have so much respect
for the poor.

648
00:38:28,198 --> 00:38:30,213
This difference between
rich and the poor.

649
00:38:30,354 --> 00:38:32,173
We humans have made it.

650
00:38:32,497 --> 00:38:34,333
For the Lord, all human
beings are the same.

651
00:38:34,956 --> 00:38:35,853
They are, isn't it?

652
00:38:36,293 --> 00:38:37,973
Shall I tell you one
more thing, sir? - Yes tell me.

653
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,613
I don't understand what you say.

654
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,973
But it feels very nice to hear.

655
00:38:43,741 --> 00:38:46,973
Shalu, shall I ask you something?
- Ask.

656
00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:50,013
Where is your house?
- Very close-by.

657
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:51,373
You can come now if you want.

658
00:38:51,552 --> 00:38:54,653
I will give you corn bread and
leafy vegetable curry to eat.

659
00:38:54,813 --> 00:38:56,373
We will eat that later.

660
00:38:56,453 --> 00:38:58,253
Shall we first take a
look at your village?

661
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,744
Village! Come on.
- Come on.

662
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,573
Wrapped in the arms
of the mountains..

663
00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:09,813
..your Lakhanpur really
is very beautiful, Shalu.

664
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:12,133
I feel like staying back here.

665
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:14,613
There is such serenity here.

666
00:39:15,181 --> 00:39:18,293
That means you liked
my village very much.

667
00:39:18,453 --> 00:39:19,493
Very nice.

668
00:39:19,945 --> 00:39:21,133
But not as nice as you.

669
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,493
Why are you joking mister.

670
00:39:23,784 --> 00:39:25,213
What is so special about Shalu?

671
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:27,093
You won't understand Shalu.

672
00:39:27,173 --> 00:39:28,618
By seeing some faces
you understand..

673
00:39:28,698 --> 00:39:30,893
..the Lord has taken a lot of
effort in their creation.

674
00:39:31,815 --> 00:39:36,373
And seeing your face, I feel
framing it in my eyes.

675
00:39:36,693 --> 00:39:38,053
Don't move! Don't move! Yes.

676
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:40,773
You move a lot.

677
00:39:40,853 --> 00:39:42,133
If you move the photograph
will not be nice.

678
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,373
Smile.

679
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,173
Are you ready now?

680
00:39:45,494 --> 00:39:46,213
What?

681
00:39:46,293 --> 00:39:47,373
What are you saying, mister?

682
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:50,453
It means, are you ready or not.

683
00:39:50,906 --> 00:39:52,053
I am ready.

684
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:52,933
Yes, very good.

685
00:39:53,053 --> 00:39:54,373
Don't move.

686
00:39:56,735 --> 00:39:58,133
Done.
- First class.

687
00:39:58,573 --> 00:39:59,373
Come on.

688
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:03,813
Except for an uncle, I don't
have anyone else mister.

689
00:40:04,014 --> 00:40:04,573
Really.

690
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,533
He is my mother and my father.

691
00:40:07,093 --> 00:40:08,938
He loves me so much.

692
00:40:09,018 --> 00:40:12,293
I feel like taking care
of him all my life.

693
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:14,213
All your life!

694
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:18,893
That's fine Shalu, but you will
have to leave him someday.

695
00:40:18,973 --> 00:40:20,293
Why?

696
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:23,133
Don't you want to get married?

697
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:28,653
Who knows mister, whether
I will get married or not?

698
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:30,333
You will, why you won't get married!

699
00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:33,093
It is said, matches
are made in heaven.

700
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:36,573
There must be someone
in your fate too.

701
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:39,093
On that note I remembered..

702
00:40:39,434 --> 00:40:41,413
..an astrologer told
me the same thing.

703
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:45,053
That your fate lies on your palms.

704
00:40:45,645 --> 00:40:48,131
Mister, do you know
how to read palms?

705
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:49,564
Read palms.
- Yes.

706
00:40:49,644 --> 00:40:50,813
Read your palm.
- Yes.

707
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:52,413
Yes, I can.

708
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:54,253
Read my palm.

709
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:56,173
Shall I see your palm?
- Yes. - Sit.

710
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:05,573
Mister, you have been holding
my hand for so long.

711
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:08,616
What's written in my hands,
what do the lines say..

712
00:41:08,696 --> 00:41:09,613
..tell me something.

713
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:11,333
In your palms.

714
00:41:12,093 --> 00:41:13,773
It is written Shalu..

715
00:41:15,748 --> 00:41:17,413
Shalu your hands are very beautiful.

716
00:41:18,653 --> 00:41:20,791
You have already said that.

717
00:41:20,871 --> 00:41:22,133
Let go of my hand.

718
00:41:23,723 --> 00:41:27,613
Mister. This Lord Shiva
temple is very famous.

719
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,093
There is a Shiva's veneration
held here every year too.

720
00:41:30,173 --> 00:41:31,253
Really.
- Yes.

721
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:34,293
Whatever you wish for with the
true heart, it is fulfilled.

722
00:41:34,573 --> 00:41:36,715
This temple is so powerful.

723
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:49,253
Shalu.

724
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,613
Let us wish for something together.

725
00:41:53,813 --> 00:41:56,253
Yes, but tell me what
we should wish for.

726
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,613
Leave my hand, mister.

727
00:42:01,142 --> 00:42:02,493
You want to free this hand.

728
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:05,013
And I want to ask for
you from Lord Shiva.

729
00:42:06,253 --> 00:42:07,333
This is my desire Shalu.

730
00:42:08,173 --> 00:42:10,653
That we are bonded
in such a relation.

731
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:12,893
That no one can ever break.

732
00:42:17,053 --> 00:42:20,253
Look mister, I am a simple
girl from the village.

733
00:42:21,213 --> 00:42:24,973
I can't understand what you say.

734
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:27,973
What are your intentions?

735
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:29,853
Shall I tell you?

736
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:31,893
Yes, say it.

737
00:42:33,493 --> 00:42:35,053
Shalu, I have fallen
in love with you.

738
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:38,573
What? Really mister?

739
00:42:38,735 --> 00:42:39,813
Yes Shalu.

740
00:42:51,693 --> 00:42:52,813
Shalu!

741
00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:54,173
Shameless! Characterless!

742
00:42:54,837 --> 00:42:57,493
Weren't you ashamed defaming me!

743
00:42:57,813 --> 00:42:58,853
Why didn't you die of shame!

744
00:42:59,182 --> 00:43:01,253
But uncle..
- I am no more your uncle!

745
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,335
Listen! You are needlessly
getting angry on her!

746
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:04,253
It is not her fault!

747
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,933
Keep quiet mister!

748
00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:08,293
I have seen everything
with my own eyes.

749
00:43:08,573 --> 00:43:12,173
You city people always do
this with us village people.

750
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:13,693
We sow the seeds.

751
00:43:13,773 --> 00:43:15,022
We look after it.

752
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:18,573
When the harvest is ready..
then you people come to cut it.

753
00:43:18,693 --> 00:43:20,013
Get one thing clear, sir.

754
00:43:20,093 --> 00:43:22,933
She is my child! Jagat Dada's!

755
00:43:23,053 --> 00:43:26,933
I will kill her,
but I will not let anyone touch her!

756
00:43:27,222 --> 00:43:28,939
Come on shameless!
- Uncle.

757
00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:30,280
Come on!

758
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,013
Your uncle is dead!

759
00:43:46,428 --> 00:43:49,063
Mister, you!

760
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:50,093
Shalu!

761
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:53,926
Shalu, I am very sorry that..

762
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,417
Why mister!

763
00:43:56,321 --> 00:43:59,721
Lovers have to face more sorrows.

764
00:44:00,116 --> 00:44:01,001
No Shalu.

765
00:44:01,467 --> 00:44:03,427
I am responsible for these sorrows.

766
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,107
And it has brought me here.

767
00:44:06,387 --> 00:44:10,587
At least my sorrows
were of some use.

768
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,387
But mister, you..
- Shalu!

769
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,667
Mister, you are so stubborn!

770
00:44:16,937 --> 00:44:18,827
You have come again to meet Shalu.

771
00:44:19,187 --> 00:44:23,667
I ask you, do you rich people
have some respect for us poor?

772
00:44:24,027 --> 00:44:26,667
Uncle, why are you taunting
me of being a rich man!

773
00:44:27,128 --> 00:44:29,067
It is true that I was
born in a rich family.

774
00:44:29,147 --> 00:44:33,187
But being poor is neither
a fault nor a crime!

775
00:44:33,267 --> 00:44:34,747
And actually, I haven't
come to meet Shalu..

776
00:44:34,827 --> 00:44:37,187
..I have come to meet you.
- Why?

777
00:44:38,392 --> 00:44:42,587
Uncle.. I want to marry Shalu.

778
00:45:22,143 --> 00:45:23,827
You are capable and close too.

779
00:45:25,443 --> 00:45:27,107
Shall I look at you or talk to you.

780
00:45:28,338 --> 00:45:29,307
Tell me.

781
00:45:30,067 --> 00:45:30,907
What can I say mister?

782
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:35,347
From today, you are my lord
and Shalu is your servant.

783
00:45:35,427 --> 00:45:37,187
You are not my servant, you
are the queen of my heart.

784
00:45:39,147 --> 00:45:42,883
Shalu, I never thought I will
find you in the village..

785
00:45:43,278 --> 00:45:48,327
..and we will get married so soon.

786
00:45:48,963 --> 00:45:50,347
It is the magic of your love.

787
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:53,427
Mister, it is not magic.

788
00:45:53,787 --> 00:45:57,467
You used to say, matches
are made in heaven.

789
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,667
That's right too.

790
00:46:01,032 --> 00:46:02,751
But look, enough waiting.

791
00:46:02,831 --> 00:46:05,056
Now remove this veil.

792
00:46:05,234 --> 00:46:06,707
You are very foolish mister.

793
00:46:07,242 --> 00:46:10,547
How can I remove the
veil, I feel shy.

794
00:46:12,787 --> 00:46:16,147
You are feeling shy, and
I am losing patience!

795
00:46:16,547 --> 00:46:20,563
I want to see how my Shalu
looks as a bride.

796
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:21,667
No, no!

797
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:24,027
Will you see my face for free?

798
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:26,587
Won't you give me a token?

799
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:33,667
I will give a nice token but
not to you, to your pink lips.

800
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:45,827
Shalu!

801
00:46:52,607 --> 00:46:53,787
Shalu, what is this misbehaviour?

802
00:46:54,516 --> 00:46:56,947
It is a mischief.

803
00:46:57,394 --> 00:47:00,147
A wife's face should be like this.

804
00:47:01,364 --> 00:47:03,267
Not this, like this.

805
00:47:03,804 --> 00:47:05,387
Like the rose flower.

806
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:38,739
"The rose flower."

807
00:47:39,784 --> 00:47:42,747
"The rose flower."

808
00:47:43,138 --> 00:47:51,276
"One in a million is the
face of my beloved."

809
00:47:51,808 --> 00:47:54,907
"The rose flower."

810
00:47:55,811 --> 00:47:59,467
"The cool breeze."

811
00:48:01,356 --> 00:48:04,187
"The cool breeze."

812
00:48:05,736 --> 00:48:14,896
"Someone should learn from
my beloved to praise."

813
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,856
"The rose flower."

814
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:24,176
"The cool breeze."

815
00:48:50,075 --> 00:48:58,339
"The fragrant henna
in your fair hands."

816
00:48:59,087 --> 00:49:05,576
"The fragrant henna
in your fair hands."

817
00:49:06,582 --> 00:49:13,176
"The bangles tinkle in
your delicate wrists."

818
00:49:13,739 --> 00:49:16,736
"The bangles tinkle."

819
00:49:18,338 --> 00:49:21,576
"The attitude of my beloved."

820
00:49:23,148 --> 00:49:26,456
"The attitude of my beloved."

821
00:49:27,536 --> 00:49:34,896
"My beloved is feeling shy."

822
00:49:36,294 --> 00:49:39,736
"The rose flower."

823
00:50:05,076 --> 00:50:13,536
"In the shelter of fragrance
there are so many flowers."

824
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:21,190
"In the shelter of fragrance
there are so many flowers."

825
00:50:21,372 --> 00:50:24,935
"The colour of love
sister-in-law true."

826
00:50:25,015 --> 00:50:28,350
"The rest are false."

827
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:32,030
"The rest are false."

828
00:50:33,156 --> 00:50:37,053
"The ambience is so beautiful."

829
00:50:38,137 --> 00:50:41,470
"The ambience is so beautiful."

830
00:50:42,825 --> 00:50:49,630
"What can I say, I am in trouble."

831
00:50:51,217 --> 00:50:54,750
"The cool breeze."

832
00:51:21,173 --> 00:51:24,110
"The waves are stable."

833
00:51:24,726 --> 00:51:27,190
"The current is steady."

834
00:51:28,157 --> 00:51:30,790
"The waves are stable."

835
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:34,470
"The current is steady."

836
00:51:35,364 --> 00:51:41,470
"Our eyes narrate our
saga of the night."

837
00:51:42,353 --> 00:51:49,457
"Our eyes narrate our
saga of the night."

838
00:51:49,537 --> 00:51:52,633
"Saga of the night."

839
00:51:53,913 --> 00:51:57,713
"The promising ambience."

840
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,633
"The promising ambience."

841
00:52:03,517 --> 00:52:10,713
"All our life, we will sing
the melody of love."

842
00:52:11,787 --> 00:52:15,033
"The rose flower."

843
00:52:15,273 --> 00:52:22,073
"One in a million is the
face of my beloved."

844
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:26,913
"The cool breeze."

845
00:52:26,993 --> 00:52:34,073
"Someone should learn from
my beloved to praise."

846
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:38,393
"The rose flower."

847
00:52:38,473 --> 00:52:45,473
"One in a million is the
face of my beloved."

848
00:52:46,915 --> 00:52:50,073
"The rose flower."

849
00:52:50,153 --> 00:52:57,073
"One in a million is the
face of my beloved."

850
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,461
Vicky, you..

851
00:53:04,945 --> 00:53:05,776
What are you looking at?

852
00:53:05,914 --> 00:53:07,674
You are looking very handsome today.

853
00:53:07,754 --> 00:53:09,194
What is this misbehaviour?

854
00:53:09,376 --> 00:53:10,816
This is not called misbehaviour.

855
00:53:11,016 --> 00:53:13,056
I have applied the black
spot on your cheek..

856
00:53:13,136 --> 00:53:15,536
..so that no one casts
an evil eye on you.

857
00:53:15,653 --> 00:53:17,056
I don't believe in
all this nonsense.

858
00:53:18,397 --> 00:53:19,216
What is the matter?

859
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:21,496
Today you are going to the
college very well dressed.

860
00:53:21,762 --> 00:53:25,242
Look, I have told you not
to interfere in my matters.

861
00:53:25,783 --> 00:53:27,762
You always obstruct
my path like a cat.

862
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:31,122
What did you say?
I look like a cat!

863
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:34,160
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
The cats will feel bad.

864
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,680
You are a bat.

865
00:53:35,817 --> 00:53:39,137
Fine, you can say whatever you want.

866
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:40,842
I have noted down everything.

867
00:53:41,143 --> 00:53:43,409
Let us get married,
then I will take my revenge.

868
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:44,482
Aarti!

869
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,996
Don't forget your status..

870
00:53:47,076 --> 00:53:49,410
..before dreaming to become this
family's daughter-in-law!

871
00:53:50,218 --> 00:53:53,178
I didn't take mercy on a helpless
and orphan child..

872
00:53:53,258 --> 00:53:56,178
..so that when she grows up,
she considers herself..

873
00:53:56,258 --> 00:53:58,338
..the daughter-in-law
of this family.

874
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:01,338
There is no comparison
between my son and you!

875
00:54:01,635 --> 00:54:02,618
Correct mummy.

876
00:54:02,877 --> 00:54:04,498
That's what I keep explaining
this girl.

877
00:54:04,714 --> 00:54:06,018
But she doesn't understand?

878
00:54:06,397 --> 00:54:08,178
Go! Go and do your work! Go!

879
00:54:08,258 --> 00:54:10,258
Get out!

880
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:12,258
Well done mummy!

881
00:54:12,338 --> 00:54:18,520
Mrs. Forgive me, but I didn't
like your behaviour with Aarti.

882
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,858
Mr. Bhandari, will.. - Let me
tell you for your information.

883
00:54:21,938 --> 00:54:24,098
This girl is not the servant
of this house.

884
00:54:24,573 --> 00:54:28,178
She is the daughter of your
late father's friend..

885
00:54:28,258 --> 00:54:31,858
..Dharamdas, whom he handed
to you while dying.

886
00:54:32,378 --> 00:54:36,538
I think that girl needs more
love than Vicky and Suraj.

887
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:38,578
Look dad.

888
00:54:38,658 --> 00:54:40,698
You can give all the love
you want to Aarti.

889
00:54:40,856 --> 00:54:43,458
But I don't have any soft
corner for Aarti. - Really.

890
00:54:44,062 --> 00:54:46,692
Goodbye mom. See you.
- Bye Sunny.

891
00:54:47,759 --> 00:54:50,080
Did you hear your son's decision?

892
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,018
Remember it.

893
00:54:53,353 --> 00:54:56,178
Yes I heard it. I spent
all my life listening.

894
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:04,263
Dear.

895
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:05,538
Yes.. yes uncle.

896
00:55:06,734 --> 00:55:08,218
Aunt scolded you, didn't she?

897
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,792
That's her habit, you know that.

898
00:55:12,389 --> 00:55:14,218
She always speaks bitterly.

899
00:55:15,015 --> 00:55:16,018
I am her husband, when
she doesn't spare me..

900
00:55:16,098 --> 00:55:17,938
..then how can she spare you.

901
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:21,418
No uncle, maybe I forgot my status.

902
00:55:21,698 --> 00:55:22,938
What is a status?

903
00:55:23,218 --> 00:55:26,457
In this world, your deeds
decide your status..

904
00:55:26,537 --> 00:55:28,778
..and not wealth and money.

905
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:31,858
I had come to say.

906
00:55:32,378 --> 00:55:35,778
Until I am there, I will
always be with you.

907
00:55:36,218 --> 00:55:38,098
The Lord will surely heed you.

908
00:55:38,618 --> 00:55:39,698
Come on smile.

909
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,858
Why are you acting miserly?

910
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,018
Come on.

911
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,378
Hi Pinky.

912
00:55:52,918 --> 00:55:54,218
So you found time to meet me.

913
00:55:54,538 --> 00:55:56,218
Sorry, I am late again.

914
00:55:56,504 --> 00:55:59,298
There is a black cat in my house,
she crossed my path.

915
00:55:59,683 --> 00:56:01,304
That's your everyday reason.

916
00:56:01,384 --> 00:56:03,298
But today I am not going
to listen to you.

917
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:04,858
I am angry with you.

918
00:56:05,298 --> 00:56:06,980
No my darling, Pinky.

919
00:56:09,677 --> 00:56:10,837
Don't do that darling.

920
00:56:11,317 --> 00:56:14,037
If you get upset with me, then
my heart will stop beating.

921
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:16,677
You know how much I love you.

922
00:56:18,037 --> 00:56:18,952
Please.

923
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:20,277
Forgive me this time.

924
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:21,597
Please.

925
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:22,917
You can be forgiven.

926
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:24,277
But on one condition.

927
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:28,677
I accept all your conditions.

928
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:30,237
Really!
- Really!

929
00:56:37,608 --> 00:56:40,877
Shalu, you are crying as
if I am going on war!

930
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,757
It is just a question of 4 days.

931
00:56:42,997 --> 00:56:44,037
I will be back soon.

932
00:56:44,437 --> 00:56:47,277
Then you will have to
take me along too.

933
00:56:48,597 --> 00:56:50,917
I have explained you so many times,
but you don't listen.

934
00:56:51,215 --> 00:56:53,277
It's not right for you to come
along with me right now.

935
00:56:53,357 --> 00:56:54,917
Why? Why isn't it right?

936
00:56:55,421 --> 00:56:59,357
I have married you, I haven't
committed any sin.

937
00:56:59,437 --> 00:57:01,277
I agree you married me.

938
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:04,037
Can't you wait for me for 4 days?

939
00:57:04,597 --> 00:57:06,809
I have explained you everything
about my family..

940
00:57:06,889 --> 00:57:09,037
..about my mother.

941
00:57:09,357 --> 00:57:10,597
Still you are being stubborn.

942
00:57:11,677 --> 00:57:13,597
Don't you have faith in me?

943
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,677
Then swear on me, you
won't forget me.

944
00:57:21,141 --> 00:57:22,357
What are you saying?

945
00:57:23,037 --> 00:57:24,917
You are now a part of my life.

946
00:57:25,837 --> 00:57:27,277
Can I stay alive forgetting you?

947
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,517
Fine.

948
00:57:29,597 --> 00:57:30,917
I agree.

949
00:57:31,431 --> 00:57:35,837
But if you take more than 4
days, I will give up my life.

950
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:38,237
Don't say that.

951
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:40,757
Look, now that I am leaving.

952
00:57:41,037 --> 00:57:42,357
Let us part happily.

953
00:57:50,357 --> 00:57:53,437
Uncle, take care of Shalu.

954
00:57:54,357 --> 00:57:55,837
I am giving you her responsibility.

955
00:57:56,357 --> 00:57:57,437
Return soon.

956
00:57:57,859 --> 00:57:59,917
The life of my daughter
rests in your hands.

957
00:58:00,357 --> 00:58:01,917
Don't leave her in a dilemma.

958
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,237
How can that be?

959
00:58:04,357 --> 00:58:05,597
Don't worry at all.

960
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,757
I will return soon
and take her along.

961
00:58:38,546 --> 00:58:39,697
Oh, Joker!

962
00:58:39,777 --> 00:58:40,631
Declare!

963
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:42,237
Take a look.

964
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:44,237
Damn it!

965
00:58:44,737 --> 00:58:46,277
Full hand again!

966
00:58:46,437 --> 00:58:48,757
I haven't declared a
game since morning.

967
00:58:49,715 --> 00:58:51,597
Aunt, brother Suraj has returned.

968
00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:54,277
Suraj! Come here!

969
00:58:56,803 --> 00:58:57,463
Yes mummy!

970
00:58:57,786 --> 00:58:58,917
Where were you?

971
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:01,169
Mummy, I was feeling
very uneasy here.

972
00:59:01,249 --> 00:59:02,742
So I went to Lakhanpur.

973
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:04,357
What, Lakhanpur!

974
00:59:04,597 --> 00:59:06,555
Yes, the atmosphere
there is very nice.

975
00:59:06,635 --> 00:59:07,468
Stop it!

976
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,917
I am not asking you about
Lakhanpur's climate, idiot!

977
00:59:15,129 --> 00:59:16,357
Answer me!

978
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:19,837
I had informed.. daddy.

979
00:59:20,274 --> 00:59:21,437
Who is daddy?

980
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:23,917
Am I no one in this house?

981
00:59:24,326 --> 00:59:26,517
Don't I have any position
in your view?

982
00:59:26,917 --> 00:59:27,872
No mummy, why not.

983
00:59:27,952 --> 00:59:30,117
You have a very dynamic position!

984
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:33,117
Then why did you dare to
commit such a mistake?

985
00:59:33,854 --> 00:59:37,517
Do you know how ashamed I felt
in front of Mrs. Poonawala?

986
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:38,636
I am sorry Mummy.

987
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:40,917
It should never happen again.

988
00:59:41,677 --> 00:59:45,077
Nothing can happen in this house
without my permission.

989
00:59:45,237 --> 00:59:47,037
Understood! Go to your room!

990
00:59:47,439 --> 00:59:48,437
Go!

991
00:59:48,837 --> 00:59:49,917
Stupid!

992
00:59:56,437 --> 00:59:57,597
Come on lets change our bets.

993
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:00,677
Brother Suraj!

994
01:00:02,697 --> 01:00:03,837
Brother Suraj!

995
01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:05,197
Here, have tea.

996
01:00:05,277 --> 01:00:06,357
I don't want to drink it.

997
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:08,917
Calm down and have tea.

998
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:11,237
You know aunt's habit.

999
01:00:11,677 --> 01:00:12,917
She has..
- What?

1000
01:00:13,437 --> 01:00:16,237
Did she have to insult me
in front of all her friends?

1001
01:00:16,357 --> 01:00:17,317
Am I a child?

1002
01:00:17,397 --> 01:00:18,282
Don't I have any respect?

1003
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:20,037
Then why don't you talk to aunt?

1004
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:22,037
Why don't you talk to aunt!

1005
01:00:22,277 --> 01:00:24,117
Have you ever heard
the name of Hitler?

1006
01:00:24,932 --> 01:00:28,037
When he used to speak, all
the colonels would shiver.

1007
01:00:28,277 --> 01:00:29,837
People would become silent.

1008
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,277
And you say, try talking to mummy.

1009
01:00:31,917 --> 01:00:33,917
My mummy is no less than a Hitler.

1010
01:00:36,961 --> 01:00:40,037
But seems like I will
have to talk to mummy.

1011
01:00:40,157 --> 01:00:41,637
Tomorrow, Monday 15th February.

1012
01:00:41,877 --> 01:00:44,348
10 o'clock in the morning
you have to inaugurate..

1013
01:00:44,428 --> 01:00:46,717
..the new showroom of Magnum Videos.

1014
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:49,148
Then 11:00, a debate..

1015
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,637
..in the oppressed women's
committee office.

1016
01:00:51,225 --> 01:00:54,317
At 12 o'clock, lunch at
Mrs. Bhanupratap's.

1017
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:55,877
At 13 o'clock..
- What?

1018
01:00:56,074 --> 01:00:58,157
Sorry, sorry, sorry
madam my mistake.

1019
01:00:58,775 --> 01:01:02,957
I mean, tonight you have to attend
the dinner at Khanna brothers.

1020
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:04,637
And you have to give a
small speech there too.

1021
01:01:04,797 --> 01:01:06,477
Oh yes. I remembered.

1022
01:01:06,557 --> 01:01:08,799
The speech that I had given in
the last fashion show. - Yes.

1023
01:01:08,879 --> 01:01:10,021
Did its photographs arrive?

1024
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:10,889
Arrived!

1025
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,957
I also sent it for getting it
published in the newspapers.

1026
01:01:13,037 --> 01:01:14,157
How were the photographs?

1027
01:01:14,418 --> 01:01:17,380
Don't ask me madam, only your
photographs are nice..

1028
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,637
Superb! Superb!

1029
01:01:18,767 --> 01:01:22,197
One of the photographs is so
nice, so nice I tell you.

1030
01:01:22,277 --> 01:01:23,929
Even Ms. India '88 will feel shy.

1031
01:01:24,009 --> 01:01:25,877
And if it would have
been in Technicolor.

1032
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,561
Then Cleopatra would
have died of shame.

1033
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:30,077
I tell you. Lovely.

1034
01:01:30,662 --> 01:01:34,065
The editor has written
a caption below it.

1035
01:01:34,145 --> 01:01:35,797
What?
- Shameless..

1036
01:01:36,753 --> 01:01:39,397
Excuse me mummy, can I come in?
- Yes.

1037
01:01:39,477 --> 01:01:40,557
Thank you.

1038
01:01:41,477 --> 01:01:42,911
Mummy, I wanted to talk to you..

1039
01:01:43,145 --> 01:01:44,877
..about something very
important and personal.

1040
01:01:44,957 --> 01:01:47,077
Sorry, sorry.
- Can't you see how busy I am?

1041
01:01:47,243 --> 01:01:49,182
We were discussing such
an important topic.

1042
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:51,170
Mummy, for a mother what
can be more important..

1043
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,774
..then her child?
- Suraj!

1044
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:55,957
I don't like your behaviour at all!

1045
01:01:56,397 --> 01:01:57,477
Now you go to your room!

1046
01:01:57,763 --> 01:01:59,849
And I will call you
when I get the time!

1047
01:01:59,995 --> 01:02:01,077
Please go!

1048
01:02:01,877 --> 01:02:02,957
Get out!

1049
01:02:05,034 --> 01:02:06,957
Everyone is getting so bold.

1050
01:02:07,277 --> 01:02:08,317
This is the limit!

1051
01:02:08,477 --> 01:02:09,824
Madam.
- What is it?

1052
01:02:09,957 --> 01:02:12,077
Can I give you an idea?
- What idea?

1053
01:02:12,477 --> 01:02:14,157
Someone has right said.

1054
01:02:14,717 --> 01:02:16,501
When the horse starts getting
out of control..

1055
01:02:16,638 --> 01:02:18,277
..then you should put
a muzzle on him.

1056
01:02:18,915 --> 01:02:20,077
My idea!

1057
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:21,174
Good, I know.

1058
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:25,397
I will talk to Mrs. Poonawala
for his engagement.

1059
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,814
But before that, you have
to give a small speech..

1060
01:02:27,894 --> 01:02:29,237
..in the anti-dowry committee.

1061
01:02:29,317 --> 01:02:31,117
I know, I know. Please keep quiet.

1062
01:02:31,277 --> 01:02:32,317
Sorry, sorry.

1063
01:02:33,741 --> 01:02:38,157
'If you take more than 4 days,
then I will give up my life.'

1064
01:02:38,637 --> 01:02:39,797
Suraj!

1065
01:02:40,235 --> 01:02:42,043
Come, come. Come mummy.

1066
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:44,545
Why did you take the trouble,
you could have called me.

1067
01:02:45,277 --> 01:02:46,877
At least you got time.

1068
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:48,877
I don't even have time to die.

1069
01:02:49,157 --> 01:02:51,277
Then how can I get time to
listen to your nonsense!

1070
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:52,523
Its not nonsense mummy..

1071
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:55,237
I have come to tell you
that tomorrow evening..

1072
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:58,477
..the Poonawala family,
are arriving for your engagement.

1073
01:02:59,557 --> 01:03:00,637
My engagement!
- Yes.

1074
01:03:00,988 --> 01:03:02,637
Don't disappear again!

1075
01:03:02,808 --> 01:03:04,797
But mummy..
- I don't want to hear anything.

1076
01:03:04,877 --> 01:03:07,397
This is my order, and you
be ready! Understood!

1077
01:03:08,186 --> 01:03:09,317
Mummy, listen to..

1078
01:03:09,717 --> 01:03:10,797
Mummy!

1079
01:03:31,037 --> 01:03:32,499
Father, good that you have come.

1080
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:33,717
I was waiting for you.

1081
01:03:33,797 --> 01:03:35,717
I know why you were waiting for me.

1082
01:03:36,237 --> 01:03:37,317
Your mother has sold you..

1083
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:39,157
..and she has made
quite a good deal.

1084
01:03:39,714 --> 01:03:42,557
Now you will be a millionaire
too, like me.

1085
01:03:43,006 --> 01:03:44,737
Father, why are you sprinkling
salt on my wounds?

1086
01:03:44,817 --> 01:03:46,778
So soon you have got wounds too.

1087
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,745
What will you do if you have
to tolerate it like me?

1088
01:03:50,138 --> 01:03:51,990
Don't worry I will heal your wounds.

1089
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:52,778
Come into my room.

1090
01:03:52,858 --> 01:03:54,000
Yes, come on father.

1091
01:03:55,177 --> 01:03:57,359
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much.

1092
01:03:57,552 --> 01:04:00,812
If I had known I will get
so much to eat here..

1093
01:04:00,973 --> 01:04:03,341
..then I wouldn't have
eaten anything at home.

1094
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:06,126
Seems like you don't get
anything to eat at home.

1095
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,828
I do, but it is not that tasty.

1096
01:04:08,908 --> 01:04:11,312
Is it not tasty or you don't
get to eat at all.

1097
01:04:12,022 --> 01:04:13,168
Greetings.
- He is..

1098
01:04:13,248 --> 01:04:13,821
I will tell you.

1099
01:04:13,981 --> 01:04:17,613
I am Mrs. Kamla Bhandari's husband.

1100
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:20,229
But you might have a position
in this house too.

1101
01:04:20,309 --> 01:04:22,379
No, I don't have a position.

1102
01:04:22,606 --> 01:04:24,981
Since my name was connected
with my Mrs..

1103
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:26,526
..I lost my position.

1104
01:04:27,206 --> 01:04:29,246
Just like the attached bathroom
is not mentioned..

1105
01:04:29,326 --> 01:04:32,126
..with the bedroom.

1106
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,206
You can call me Mrs. Bhandari's
attached bathroom.

1107
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:37,126
It is not something to laugh about.

1108
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:38,606
It's a damn fact.

1109
01:04:38,763 --> 01:04:42,560
Have you inquired about
the character of the boy?

1110
01:04:42,886 --> 01:04:46,446
Yes, we have inquired about
your son's character.

1111
01:04:46,886 --> 01:04:48,886
Your son has a very good character.

1112
01:04:48,966 --> 01:04:51,206
Yes, he has a very good character.

1113
01:04:51,286 --> 01:04:54,376
But we don't want to
keep you in the dark..

1114
01:04:54,456 --> 01:04:57,788
..because we have to face
the Lord too, after death.

1115
01:04:58,326 --> 01:05:00,366
The boy does have a vice.

1116
01:05:02,086 --> 01:05:02,966
What do you mean..

1117
01:05:03,046 --> 01:05:05,046
The boy.. don't tell anyone.

1118
01:05:05,575 --> 01:05:07,838
I feel ashamed saying it.

1119
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:10,606
Drinks alcohol.

1120
01:05:12,887 --> 01:05:13,966
Gambles.

1121
01:05:15,606 --> 01:05:16,686
Goes to brothel.

1122
01:05:18,006 --> 01:05:19,206
Is non
- vegetarian.

1123
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:22,126
He eats onions.

1124
01:05:22,206 --> 01:05:24,206
What does he eat?
- Onions! Onions!

1125
01:05:27,255 --> 01:05:30,766
Mr. Bhandari, you scared me.
- I was just tying.

1126
01:05:30,846 --> 01:05:33,126
But where is your onion eater?

1127
01:05:33,206 --> 01:05:34,886
Good evening, Mr and Mrs. Poonawala.

1128
01:05:35,206 --> 01:05:36,606
Good evening Mrs. Bhandari.

1129
01:05:36,686 --> 01:05:39,427
Mrs. Bhandari, before you begin.

1130
01:05:39,507 --> 01:05:41,193
Was there a call for me?

1131
01:05:41,273 --> 01:05:42,326
No Mr. Bhandari.

1132
01:05:42,446 --> 01:05:45,246
Until the engagement
is not complete..

1133
01:05:45,326 --> 01:05:47,309
..there won't be any calls for you.
- So sweet of you.

1134
01:05:47,389 --> 01:05:48,148
Come.

1135
01:05:48,384 --> 01:05:49,526
Take a seat.

1136
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:50,766
Suraj.
- Yes.

1137
01:05:50,886 --> 01:05:51,926
Meet him.

1138
01:05:52,006 --> 01:05:55,514
He is your father-in-law,
Mr. Poonawala.

1139
01:05:55,725 --> 01:05:57,446
Hello, God bless you.

1140
01:05:57,526 --> 01:05:59,581
Sit, sit why are you standing.

1141
01:05:59,661 --> 01:06:01,032
Thank you, thank you.

1142
01:06:01,171 --> 01:06:04,573
Mrs. Poonawala, it took
me a while to get ready.

1143
01:06:04,653 --> 01:06:05,268
I am sorry.

1144
01:06:05,348 --> 01:06:07,128
Did you mind?

1145
01:06:07,321 --> 01:06:08,257
Not at all.

1146
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:12,052
If women don't take time to
get ready, then who will?

1147
01:06:12,132 --> 01:06:13,886
Isn't it?
- You are absolutely right.

1148
01:06:14,152 --> 01:06:17,871
I think we should commence
the engagement ritual.

1149
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:19,446
Yes, yes.

1150
01:06:22,669 --> 01:06:26,834
Mrs. Bhandari, there is nothing
wrong if we wait a while.

1151
01:06:26,914 --> 01:06:28,515
There is a possibility that
Vicky might arrive too.

1152
01:06:28,692 --> 01:06:30,114
Oh yes.

1153
01:06:30,447 --> 01:06:32,243
Here come the trumpets!
- What?

1154
01:06:32,323 --> 01:06:34,486
I mean, the band is here.
- Band!

1155
01:06:34,642 --> 01:06:37,642
Mrs. Poonawala, you brought a
band for the engagement too.

1156
01:06:38,001 --> 01:06:38,722
Not at all.

1157
01:06:38,802 --> 01:06:39,962
Why would I bring a band?

1158
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:41,722
You are done for?
- What?

1159
01:06:41,802 --> 01:06:43,322
I mean, if the band has arrived
then we should go..

1160
01:06:43,402 --> 01:06:45,322
..and take a look, Mrs. Chunawala..

1161
01:06:45,402 --> 01:06:46,722
..Mrs. Kathawala! Mrs. Koylawala!

1162
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:47,963
Which one is it?
- Poonawala.

1163
01:06:48,043 --> 01:06:48,962
It's one and the some.
- Come on

1164
01:06:49,042 --> 01:06:50,989
Let us take a look.
- Come on.

1165
01:06:51,069 --> 01:06:52,322
You might have never
seen such a band.

1166
01:07:25,756 --> 01:07:29,362
"When the groom doesn't
take the bride..

1167
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:34,202
..along after marriage."

1168
01:07:35,202 --> 01:07:43,642
"Then the bride arrives in the
palanquin to take the groom."

1169
01:07:45,689 --> 01:07:48,810
"My beloved!"

1170
01:07:50,642 --> 01:07:55,362
"My beloved! Come to me,
come before me."

1171
01:07:55,772 --> 01:08:00,737
"My beloved! Come to me,
come before me."

1172
01:08:01,455 --> 01:08:05,522
"I have come to pick you up."

1173
01:08:05,602 --> 01:08:10,122
"I have come to pick you
up along with the band."

1174
01:08:10,407 --> 01:08:14,962
"My beloved! Come to me,
come before me."

1175
01:08:15,355 --> 01:08:20,202
"My beloved! Come to me,
come before me."

1176
01:08:50,195 --> 01:08:54,802
"The promise that you made."

1177
01:08:55,342 --> 01:08:58,642
"The promise that you made."

1178
01:08:59,642 --> 01:09:01,802
"Don't forget that promise."

1179
01:09:02,358 --> 01:09:07,002
"Don't bring a mistress
until I am alive."

1180
01:09:07,082 --> 01:09:10,362
"Don't bring a mistress."

1181
01:09:10,442 --> 01:09:14,362
"Take a look."

1182
01:09:14,722 --> 01:09:19,362
"Take a look, don't turn away."

1183
01:09:19,442 --> 01:09:24,226
"My beloved! Come to me,
come before me."

1184
01:09:24,482 --> 01:09:29,202
"My beloved! Come to me,
come before me."

1185
01:09:59,253 --> 01:10:03,659
"I didn't tell a lie."

1186
01:10:04,362 --> 01:10:07,768
"I didn't say anything wrong."

1187
01:10:09,146 --> 01:10:11,802
"I didn't tell a lie."

1188
01:10:11,882 --> 01:10:14,322
"I didn't say anything wrong."

1189
01:10:14,402 --> 01:10:18,997
"Then why do you sweat
seeing me, my beloved."

1190
01:10:19,077 --> 01:10:22,122
"Why do you sweat?"

1191
01:10:22,202 --> 01:10:26,311
"Take me inside the house."

1192
01:10:26,391 --> 01:10:28,722
"Take me inside the house."

1193
01:10:28,802 --> 01:10:31,043
"Open the door."

1194
01:10:31,123 --> 01:10:35,882
"My beloved! Come to me,
come before me."

1195
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:45,642
"My beloved! Come to me,
come before me."

1196
01:10:47,234 --> 01:10:49,882
How did you like my song and dance?

1197
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:51,802
You are a very ill-mannered girl!

1198
01:10:52,202 --> 01:10:53,943
I thought you have come
on the occasion..

1199
01:10:54,023 --> 01:10:55,362
..of my son's engagement.

1200
01:10:55,482 --> 01:10:57,162
And will take some reward
by singing and dancing.

1201
01:10:57,242 --> 01:10:59,962
But you needlessly created a stir!

1202
01:11:01,098 --> 01:11:02,827
My beloved was getting engaged..

1203
01:11:03,026 --> 01:11:04,962
..that's why I created a stir.

1204
01:11:05,722 --> 01:11:08,543
It's my mistake, forgive
me mother-in-law.

1205
01:11:08,882 --> 01:11:09,633
What?

1206
01:11:09,935 --> 01:11:12,002
How can I be your mother-in-law?

1207
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:16,722
What else will I call the
mother of my husband?

1208
01:11:16,962 --> 01:11:18,122
Husband! What husband?

1209
01:11:18,962 --> 01:11:20,882
This mister, who else?

1210
01:11:22,097 --> 01:11:23,202
What nonsense!

1211
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:24,642
Suraj is your husband!

1212
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:26,202
Then what?

1213
01:11:26,691 --> 01:11:31,722
Am I insane to come here from
Lakhanpur in the palanquin?

1214
01:11:31,802 --> 01:11:33,278
Along with the band.

1215
01:11:33,621 --> 01:11:34,722
Ask your son.

1216
01:11:35,342 --> 01:11:38,042
Mrs. Bhandari, what is all this?

1217
01:11:38,322 --> 01:11:39,962
Suraj, what is all this?

1218
01:11:40,042 --> 01:11:41,521
Is she your wife?

1219
01:11:41,882 --> 01:11:44,362
Mummy, the thing is that..

1220
01:11:44,964 --> 01:11:46,362
Tell her, tell her.

1221
01:11:46,642 --> 01:11:47,909
When we have fallen in love,
then why to be scared!

1222
01:11:50,943 --> 01:11:52,722
Yes, there is nothing
to be scared.

1223
01:11:52,956 --> 01:11:53,836
Say it, come on say it.

1224
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:55,122
That's the flaw in your mummy..

1225
01:11:55,202 --> 01:11:56,362
I mean good quality.

1226
01:11:56,676 --> 01:11:58,482
She likes the truth, isn't it?

1227
01:11:58,882 --> 01:11:59,825
Look, she is saying yes.

1228
01:11:59,905 --> 01:12:01,122
Tell me son.

1229
01:12:01,362 --> 01:12:03,962
Yes mummy, I have married her.

1230
01:12:04,973 --> 01:12:06,122
What?

1231
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,362
I am so unfortunate!

1232
01:12:11,122 --> 01:12:14,482
Mrs. Bhandari, we are
the unfortunate ones!

1233
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:17,554
We didn't know, that
your entire family..

1234
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:20,362
..was such great liars!

1235
01:12:20,722 --> 01:12:23,402
Weren't you ashamed getting
my spinster daughter..

1236
01:12:23,482 --> 01:12:27,202
..engaged to your married son?

1237
01:12:27,362 --> 01:12:30,594
When the snacks were tasty,
I felt something was suspicious!

1238
01:12:30,674 --> 01:12:32,437
There is something wrong!

1239
01:12:32,517 --> 01:12:34,722
Forget about that!

1240
01:12:34,954 --> 01:12:38,341
If we want, we can sue them for..

1241
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:41,722
..10 lakh for this cheating!

1242
01:12:41,802 --> 01:12:44,802
But we.. we are not
so lowly like them!

1243
01:12:44,882 --> 01:12:46,824
Come on! Come on!
- Listen to me!

1244
01:12:47,151 --> 01:12:49,282
Keep it to yourself!

1245
01:12:49,362 --> 01:12:50,482
Come on children, come on.

1246
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:54,722
Suraj!

1247
01:12:54,802 --> 01:12:59,602
Suraj, I feel like strangling you
or swallowing poison myself!

1248
01:12:59,963 --> 01:13:03,282
You made this performer
our daughter-in-law!

1249
01:13:05,962 --> 01:13:09,002
Mr. Bhandari, what
are you looking at!

1250
01:13:09,261 --> 01:13:09,802
..Then what should I see?

1251
01:13:09,882 --> 01:13:12,091
What, can't you say something?

1252
01:13:12,386 --> 01:13:13,482
What should I say?

1253
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:17,202
Your son has defamed
us so shamelessly!

1254
01:13:17,362 --> 01:13:18,882
Then why are we yelling
outside here.

1255
01:13:18,962 --> 01:13:20,802
Let us do one thing,
let us go inside.

1256
01:13:21,075 --> 01:13:22,402
We will sit at the round
table and think..

1257
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:24,842
..how we can get your fame back.

1258
01:13:24,922 --> 01:13:27,122
Science has progressed a lot.

1259
01:13:27,252 --> 01:13:28,802
Anything can happen.

1260
01:13:28,882 --> 01:13:30,202
My idea!
- There.

1261
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:31,882
My idea.
- To hell with your idea!

1262
01:13:32,122 --> 01:13:33,202
Secretary.
- Yes madam!

1263
01:13:33,282 --> 01:13:35,482
Follow me!
- I am following! I am following!

1264
01:13:35,802 --> 01:13:38,177
Definitely, definitely madam.

1265
01:13:43,115 --> 01:13:45,522
Don't feel bad about what
your mother-in-law said.

1266
01:13:45,602 --> 01:13:46,882
It is her habit.

1267
01:13:47,419 --> 01:13:48,642
But this child is innocent.

1268
01:13:49,202 --> 01:13:51,802
Why are you still standing
here silently?

1269
01:13:52,326 --> 01:13:53,238
Go!

1270
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:54,402
Take my daughter-in-law inside.

1271
01:13:54,566 --> 01:13:56,802
Mummy..
- Nothing. Go!

1272
01:13:57,519 --> 01:13:58,642
Bless you, dear.

1273
01:13:58,843 --> 01:13:59,962
Come Shalu.

1274
01:14:04,676 --> 01:14:07,882
Ramayana is over, now
Mahabharata will start.

1275
01:14:08,453 --> 01:14:09,642
Pray for me.

1276
01:14:11,471 --> 01:14:12,962
Sister-in-law wait.

1277
01:14:13,255 --> 01:14:14,654
Let me perform the lamp veneration..

1278
01:14:14,734 --> 01:14:16,122
..before you enter the house.

1279
01:14:24,091 --> 01:14:25,202
Aarti!

1280
01:14:26,465 --> 01:14:27,715
Get rid of all this!

1281
01:14:29,822 --> 01:14:31,362
I can never accept this uneducated..

1282
01:14:31,442 --> 01:14:33,563
..ignorant girl as
my daughter-in-law.

1283
01:14:37,992 --> 01:14:41,713
"Let's built a nice bungalow.."

1284
01:14:42,123 --> 01:14:44,187
"Let's built a nice bungalow.."

1285
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:46,787
Mr. Bhandari!
- Who is it?

1286
01:14:46,867 --> 01:14:47,882
What do you mean?

1287
01:14:48,112 --> 01:14:53,579
Here you are dreaming, and I
am facing so much trouble!

1288
01:14:53,723 --> 01:14:55,179
What?
- What do you mean?

1289
01:14:55,548 --> 01:14:58,988
Do you have time to
do anything else?

1290
01:14:59,068 --> 01:15:02,148
I have Saigal sir to listen to,
and you are there to scold me!

1291
01:15:02,228 --> 01:15:03,925
What else do I need?

1292
01:15:04,005 --> 01:15:05,468
Tell me how I can serve you!

1293
01:15:06,028 --> 01:15:07,668
As if you don't know anything.

1294
01:15:07,748 --> 01:15:10,213
Your son Suraj has
done such a thing..

1295
01:15:10,368 --> 01:15:12,468
..that I cannot face anyone!

1296
01:15:12,792 --> 01:15:14,628
What are you saying? What happened..

1297
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:17,937
Thank God, atleast he
heeded to my request.

1298
01:15:18,017 --> 01:15:18,687
..What do you mean?

1299
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:21,268
I mean, when there such a
good husband in the house..

1300
01:15:21,348 --> 01:15:24,177
..then what is the need to show
this face to anyone else.

1301
01:15:24,315 --> 01:15:26,870
You always take everything jokingly.

1302
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:28,682
And here, I am burning up.

1303
01:15:29,028 --> 01:15:31,896
I can smell something
rotten burning.

1304
01:15:31,976 --> 01:15:33,268
I am sorry, it is your heart.

1305
01:15:33,348 --> 01:15:34,664
Shall I inform the fire brigade?

1306
01:15:34,744 --> 01:15:36,268
They will come quickly
and douse the fire.

1307
01:15:36,466 --> 01:15:40,948
Mr. Bhandari, this fire can
never be doused! - Really.

1308
01:15:41,028 --> 01:15:46,188
Foolish Suraj has brought an
uneducated and ignorant girl..

1309
01:15:46,268 --> 01:15:49,948
And tarnished your desires
and smoked your emotions.

1310
01:15:50,028 --> 01:15:53,370
Isn't it? - Keep quiet,
for Gods sake keep quiet.

1311
01:15:53,708 --> 01:15:56,949
I had seen so many dreams
for my son Suraj.

1312
01:15:57,029 --> 01:16:00,923
But he brought a performer
in this house!

1313
01:16:01,003 --> 01:16:01,924
What had to happen has happened.

1314
01:16:02,004 --> 01:16:02,907
Forget it.

1315
01:16:02,987 --> 01:16:05,188
She will stay in this house,
and have a meagre meal.

1316
01:16:05,268 --> 01:16:06,348
What difference does it make?

1317
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:08,050
You are talking about meagre meals.

1318
01:16:08,349 --> 01:16:10,395
Mr. Bhadari, if I let that
ignorant, uneducated girl..

1319
01:16:10,475 --> 01:16:12,899
..stay in this house
for a second more.

1320
01:16:13,049 --> 01:16:14,862
Then my name isn't Kamla Bhandari!

1321
01:16:14,942 --> 01:16:15,717
Understood!

1322
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,188
I want to build a nice bungalow!

1323
01:16:17,268 --> 01:16:19,308
Keep making bungalows
the entire day!

1324
01:16:20,508 --> 01:16:22,339
Seems like there is a horse-shoe
affixed in her feet.

1325
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:26,412
She will not let me
build a bungalow.

1326
01:16:27,486 --> 01:16:28,243
Shut up.

1327
01:16:28,323 --> 01:16:29,787
Call me mother-in-law, will you!

1328
01:16:29,867 --> 01:16:30,501
Come on.

1329
01:16:30,706 --> 01:16:33,028
What is the matter mother-in-law?

1330
01:16:33,763 --> 01:16:34,708
Come with me!

1331
01:16:34,788 --> 01:16:36,508
What are you doing mother-in-law?

1332
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:43,508
Come with me!

1333
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:52,068
I understand the mentality
of village people like you.

1334
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:56,028
And I know your motive of
coming in this house.

1335
01:16:56,787 --> 01:16:59,988
Marriage is just an act
that you have put up!

1336
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:02,945
All you want is money!

1337
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:06,628
Here. Here is what you want!

1338
01:17:07,095 --> 01:17:08,628
Take all you want.

1339
01:17:08,902 --> 01:17:10,188
And get out of this house.

1340
01:17:10,268 --> 01:17:11,628
Right now.

1341
01:17:12,068 --> 01:17:13,148
Didn't you hear what I am saying?

1342
01:17:13,365 --> 01:17:16,522
Take all the money and
wealth you want!

1343
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:18,969
And please leave my son alone!

1344
01:17:19,393 --> 01:17:20,908
What are you saying mother-in-law?

1345
01:17:21,442 --> 01:17:22,948
He is my husband.

1346
01:17:23,268 --> 01:17:24,868
And husband is considered
as the Lord!

1347
01:17:25,647 --> 01:17:27,628
And you never sell your husband,
mother-in-law.

1348
01:17:28,422 --> 01:17:32,383
I have not come in this
house for the money.

1349
01:17:32,755 --> 01:17:34,828
I have come for your love,
mother-in-law.

1350
01:17:34,908 --> 01:17:36,628
For out love!

1351
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,988
I understand you very well!

1352
01:17:39,068 --> 01:17:40,748
I don't want to hear another word!

1353
01:17:40,828 --> 01:17:41,908
Get out of here!

1354
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:46,708
then mother-in-law,
my answer is that..

1355
01:17:46,877 --> 01:17:48,708
..a daughter-in-law comes
in the in-laws house..

1356
01:17:48,788 --> 01:17:51,548
..in the palanquin, and
leaves on the pyre!

1357
01:17:52,428 --> 01:17:54,388
Now I will not leave this
house till I am alive!

1358
01:18:02,061 --> 01:18:05,468
I agree that you were helpless.

1359
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:09,828
But, you couldn't
even send a letter.

1360
01:18:11,982 --> 01:18:14,517
Look, whatever the Lord
does it is for our good.

1361
01:18:15,252 --> 01:18:16,146
If I would have written
you a letter..

1362
01:18:16,226 --> 01:18:17,468
..I would have asked
you for more time.

1363
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:19,905
Then this wouldn't have happened!

1364
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:24,548
But Shalu!

1365
01:18:25,685 --> 01:18:28,148
I have told you a lot of
things about my family.

1366
01:18:29,289 --> 01:18:31,116
You have a small example yourself.

1367
01:18:32,351 --> 01:18:35,789
I think will you be able to
live in this atmosphere.

1368
01:18:37,105 --> 01:18:38,068
Why not!

1369
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:43,438
For a married woman, the in-laws'
house means everything.

1370
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:47,388
Now I will bring happiness
in this house.

1371
01:18:52,809 --> 01:18:55,761
A man gets rewarded by
the men's committee.

1372
01:18:56,270 --> 01:19:02,228
It is said, that husband beat
his coarse wife to pulp.

1373
01:19:02,586 --> 01:19:07,988
For that.. he was awarded
a gold medal.

1374
01:19:08,068 --> 01:19:09,148
Father-in-law.

1375
01:19:12,024 --> 01:19:12,988
Come dear.

1376
01:19:16,154 --> 01:19:17,468
Greetings father-in-law.
- Bless you dear.

1377
01:19:17,826 --> 01:19:19,412
I have brought tea for you.

1378
01:19:19,492 --> 01:19:21,120
Why did you bring it, isn't
there a servant in the house?

1379
01:19:21,602 --> 01:19:23,148
There are a many servants in
the house, father-in-law.

1380
01:19:23,578 --> 01:19:26,308
But it is my duty
to look after you.

1381
01:19:26,849 --> 01:19:27,828
Here.

1382
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:30,308
May God bless you, dear!

1383
01:19:30,823 --> 01:19:32,468
I have brought tea for
mother-in-law too.

1384
01:19:32,548 --> 01:19:33,908
No, Wait! Wait! Wait!

1385
01:19:34,396 --> 01:19:35,653
The serpent is asleep,
don't wake her up..

1386
01:19:35,733 --> 01:19:38,040
..or else she will wake
up and bite you.

1387
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,179
Don't worry father-in-law.

1388
01:19:42,246 --> 01:19:46,409
Why won't I worry for you, you
are advancing towards trouble.

1389
01:19:51,748 --> 01:19:52,828
Mother-in-law.

1390
01:19:55,486 --> 01:19:56,468
Mother-in-law.

1391
01:19:57,639 --> 01:19:58,548
Mother-in-law.

1392
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:00,308
Who the hell is it?

1393
01:20:04,465 --> 01:20:05,468
You!

1394
01:20:06,342 --> 01:20:09,468
How dare you come in my room?

1395
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:11,908
With whose permission
have you come here?

1396
01:20:12,139 --> 01:20:13,251
Why have you come here?

1397
01:20:13,456 --> 01:20:15,148
I have brought tea for
you, mother-in-law.

1398
01:20:15,228 --> 01:20:17,308
Who asked you to bring the tea?

1399
01:20:17,502 --> 01:20:18,908
Where are all the servants
of the house?

1400
01:20:18,988 --> 01:20:20,163
I said get out!

1401
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:23,576
But..
- I said get out!

1402
01:20:23,656 --> 01:20:24,548
Mother-in-law.

1403
01:20:24,679 --> 01:20:25,801
Get out of my room!

1404
01:20:25,881 --> 01:20:26,908
Get lost!

1405
01:20:28,938 --> 01:20:29,908
God knows why this uneducated..

1406
01:20:29,988 --> 01:20:31,668
..ignorant girl comes here?

1407
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:32,746
Why has she come here?

1408
01:20:32,826 --> 01:20:34,508
She ruined my entire mood.

1409
01:20:39,228 --> 01:20:40,388
I had warned you.

1410
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:42,868
Don't provoke your mother-in-law,
you didn't agree.

1411
01:20:43,564 --> 01:20:44,832
Everything went wrong, right?

1412
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:57,046
This..
- No need to be shocked.

1413
01:20:57,126 --> 01:20:59,786
Every morning in this house,
the English ghost wakes up..

1414
01:20:59,866 --> 01:21:01,887
..then you get to hear such music.

1415
01:21:02,068 --> 01:21:03,548
And then you can hear
the utensils clinking.

1416
01:21:03,841 --> 01:21:07,388
But father-in-law,
this is not right.

1417
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:09,748
It is not right it is
a very bad thing.

1418
01:21:10,134 --> 01:21:11,502
But what can I do, who
will speak against it.

1419
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:14,426
Father-in-law,
can I say something?

1420
01:21:14,506 --> 01:21:15,468
What?

1421
01:21:15,613 --> 01:21:18,308
From tomorrow, this will
not happen in this house.

1422
01:21:18,388 --> 01:21:19,468
It has been happening
since many years..

1423
01:21:19,548 --> 01:21:20,708
..what's so different
about tomorrow.

1424
01:21:21,426 --> 01:21:26,663
Just watch, my name is Shalu.

1425
01:22:15,712 --> 01:22:19,829
"You name is true."

1426
01:22:21,775 --> 01:22:25,548
"You name is true."

1427
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:33,461
"You solve all our problems."

1428
01:22:33,695 --> 01:22:39,148
"You name is true."

1429
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:44,908
"You solve all our problems."

1430
01:22:45,595 --> 01:22:48,148
"You name is true."

1431
01:22:48,587 --> 01:22:51,308
"You name is true."

1432
01:22:51,814 --> 01:22:57,068
"You solve all our problems."

1433
01:22:57,548 --> 01:23:02,908
"You name is true."

1434
01:23:24,609 --> 01:23:30,148
"You are merciful like the ocean."

1435
01:23:30,793 --> 01:23:36,458
"You are merciful like the ocean."

1436
01:23:36,675 --> 01:23:41,249
"And it has no shores."

1437
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:45,148
"You solve all the problems."

1438
01:23:45,228 --> 01:23:48,341
"You solve all the problems."

1439
01:23:48,628 --> 01:23:52,988
"Whenever anyone calls you."

1440
01:23:54,171 --> 01:24:00,672
"I recite your name!
I recite your name!"

1441
01:24:00,752 --> 01:24:06,148
"In the morning and evening."

1442
01:24:06,813 --> 01:24:12,068
"You solve all our problems."

1443
01:24:12,574 --> 01:24:18,228
"You name is true."

1444
01:24:18,628 --> 01:24:24,145
"You solve all our problems."

1445
01:24:24,612 --> 01:24:28,548
"You name is true."

1446
01:24:45,502 --> 01:24:51,228
"Lord, show the right path to
the ones that have strayed."

1447
01:24:51,451 --> 01:24:57,151
"Lord, show the right path to
the ones that have strayed."

1448
01:24:57,661 --> 01:25:05,548
"Let love blossom in every house."

1449
01:25:06,681 --> 01:25:09,628
"You help everyone."

1450
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:12,548
"You help everyone."

1451
01:25:13,238 --> 01:25:18,788
"Without being asked
or any expectations."

1452
01:25:19,327 --> 01:25:24,388
"You solve all our problems."

1453
01:25:24,991 --> 01:25:30,628
"You name is true."

1454
01:25:31,217 --> 01:25:35,068
"You solve all our problems."

1455
01:25:35,148 --> 01:25:37,488
Stop singing!

1456
01:25:44,988 --> 01:25:48,068
Didn't you like my devotional song?

1457
01:25:48,148 --> 01:25:49,960
No, no dear, that's not it.

1458
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:53,280
After so many years, I have heard
something good in this house.

1459
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:54,620
Otherwise, everyday in this house..

1460
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:57,228
..all we hear is disco
and rock music.

1461
01:25:57,401 --> 01:25:59,511
All day, we have to hearing
horrible sounds.

1462
01:25:59,746 --> 01:26:01,788
What do you mean Mr. Bhandari?

1463
01:26:02,161 --> 01:26:06,508
You call our western
music, horrible.

1464
01:26:06,784 --> 01:26:07,908
Your music!

1465
01:26:09,123 --> 01:26:12,412
Don't mind madam, but just
like someone else's wife..

1466
01:26:12,492 --> 01:26:14,720
..cannot be yours when
brought in the house.

1467
01:26:15,101 --> 01:26:16,148
Just like that playing someone
else's music in our country..

1468
01:26:16,228 --> 01:26:17,908
..doesn't make it ours.

1469
01:26:18,352 --> 01:26:22,308
Dad, mummy means that we are
a fan of western music.

1470
01:26:23,057 --> 01:26:24,228
Why are you looking up there?

1471
01:26:24,308 --> 01:26:25,388
I thought this fan.

1472
01:26:25,468 --> 01:26:28,068
Western music has become a part
of our house and culture.

1473
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:31,077
Won't we feel bad if someone
insults our western music?

1474
01:26:31,565 --> 01:26:32,788
Yes, of course you will.

1475
01:26:32,998 --> 01:26:34,918
You are absolutely right my son.

1476
01:26:35,466 --> 01:26:38,601
I cannot wake up until
I don't hear pop music.

1477
01:26:38,681 --> 01:26:40,563
I don't get the mood
to do anything.

1478
01:26:40,690 --> 01:26:41,565
It's the same about
you too, isn't it?

1479
01:26:41,645 --> 01:26:42,868
Correct mummy, correct.

1480
01:26:42,988 --> 01:26:46,195
From 7 -8 o'clock in the
morning we are so used..

1481
01:26:46,275 --> 01:26:50,778
..to hearing pop music, just like
father likes to read the newspaper..

1482
01:26:50,858 --> 01:26:52,988
..and brother, likes to exercise.

1483
01:26:53,476 --> 01:26:56,788
Vicky, there is a big difference
between your likes and ours.

1484
01:26:57,528 --> 01:27:01,453
Reading the newspaper gives
you a sharp mind..

1485
01:27:01,685 --> 01:27:03,988
..and by exercising
you remain healthy.

1486
01:27:04,349 --> 01:27:06,068
Just great!

1487
01:27:06,685 --> 01:27:10,497
Since this ignorant
girl has arrived..

1488
01:27:10,577 --> 01:27:13,638
..you have got a tongue too.

1489
01:27:13,908 --> 01:27:15,508
That's not it, mother-in-law.

1490
01:27:15,842 --> 01:27:18,308
There is a saying, when
the morning is fine..

1491
01:27:18,455 --> 01:27:19,988
..the entire day goes well.

1492
01:27:20,308 --> 01:27:22,307
If you take the Lords
name in the morning..

1493
01:27:22,434 --> 01:27:24,148
..you find peace and serenity.

1494
01:27:24,228 --> 01:27:25,978
Wealth flourishes in the house.

1495
01:27:26,277 --> 01:27:27,828
Wealth flourishes!
- Yes.

1496
01:27:27,908 --> 01:27:28,988
What nonsense!

1497
01:27:29,148 --> 01:27:30,948
Secretary!
- Yes madam.

1498
01:27:31,230 --> 01:27:33,548
Find out when will
the electricity come back

1499
01:27:33,816 --> 01:27:35,108
There is no point
in doing that, madam.

1500
01:27:35,316 --> 01:27:37,148
Something that is not gone,
cannot come back.

1501
01:27:37,287 --> 01:27:39,068
And something that cannot
come back, how can it go.

1502
01:27:39,302 --> 01:27:40,068
What do you mean?

1503
01:27:40,148 --> 01:27:42,148
I will tell you mother-in-law.

1504
01:27:43,443 --> 01:27:47,868
The electric fuse, I
have taken it out.

1505
01:27:48,286 --> 01:27:51,642
Now everyday from 7-8 o'clock
in the morning..

1506
01:27:51,775 --> 01:27:53,041
..this will happen.
- What?

1507
01:27:53,346 --> 01:27:54,828
Yes.
- Disgusting!

1508
01:27:55,188 --> 01:27:56,308
Come on son.

1509
01:27:56,978 --> 01:27:59,042
Secretary, follow me!
- Yes madam.

1510
01:27:59,122 --> 01:28:01,068
Is this a house or an asylum?

1511
01:28:01,148 --> 01:28:02,659
I can't stay in this house!

1512
01:28:02,788 --> 01:28:04,068
These are mad people!

1513
01:28:05,657 --> 01:28:08,142
God, please save me.

1514
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:09,708
She is a very dangerous woman.

1515
01:28:11,468 --> 01:28:13,988
This girl has already started
doing as she pleases!

1516
01:28:14,548 --> 01:28:17,148
I can never tolerate this.

1517
01:28:17,228 --> 01:28:19,468
She has just taken the electric
fuse out now madam.

1518
01:28:19,748 --> 01:28:22,908
That day is not far, when she
will devour your happiness.

1519
01:28:23,068 --> 01:28:25,708
And there will be darkness
in your life forever.

1520
01:28:25,788 --> 01:28:29,274
That will happen only when I will
let her stay in this house!

1521
01:28:29,354 --> 01:28:31,468
You shouldn't let her stay, madam.

1522
01:28:31,923 --> 01:28:33,313
What I am there for?

1523
01:28:33,393 --> 01:28:35,148
Nut for that I will have
to think of an idea.

1524
01:28:35,308 --> 01:28:36,388
I will tell you tomorrow.

1525
01:28:36,529 --> 01:28:37,728
Why tomorrow, why not today?

1526
01:28:37,808 --> 01:28:39,708
Today, it is very inauspicious
for you.

1527
01:28:39,788 --> 01:28:40,908
What?
- I mean tomorrow.

1528
01:28:41,148 --> 01:28:43,068
Tomorrow is a good day to
start anything auspicious.

1529
01:28:43,294 --> 01:28:44,468
Tomorrow is the tenth day
of the auspicious month.

1530
01:28:45,203 --> 01:28:46,548
Right you are.
- Thank you madam.

1531
01:28:46,628 --> 01:28:47,708
My token.

1532
01:28:49,748 --> 01:28:53,059
I was just a bit late in coming,
and my beloved is ready..

1533
01:28:53,139 --> 01:28:57,108
..to go to the factory.
Here, have milk.

1534
01:28:57,564 --> 01:28:58,868
I don't want it.

1535
01:28:59,075 --> 01:29:04,628
Don't want it! Beloved,
are you upset with me.

1536
01:29:04,854 --> 01:29:05,868
I should be upset with you.

1537
01:29:06,324 --> 01:29:07,628
You switched off the electricity,
Shalu.

1538
01:29:07,999 --> 01:29:08,788
What?

1539
01:29:09,031 --> 01:29:11,468
I mean..
- You mean the fuse!

1540
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:12,741
Yes, that.

1541
01:29:12,821 --> 01:29:14,868
Why did you raise such a
stir in the house, Shalu.

1542
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:19,868
Beloved, this house belongs to
me as much as it does to you.

1543
01:29:20,026 --> 01:29:21,616
I am the daughter-in-law
of this house.

1544
01:29:21,908 --> 01:29:25,668
And it is my duty to mend anything
that's wrong in this house.

1545
01:29:25,748 --> 01:29:28,457
Shalu, my mother.. mummy.

1546
01:29:28,777 --> 01:29:31,938
Nothing happens in this house
without her permission!

1547
01:29:32,228 --> 01:29:33,749
Why are you locking horns with her?

1548
01:29:33,997 --> 01:29:35,948
Why are you worried?

1549
01:29:36,765 --> 01:29:38,788
It is between me and
my mother-in-law.

1550
01:29:39,228 --> 01:29:40,927
I will deal with her myself.

1551
01:29:42,185 --> 01:29:43,593
Here, drink the milk.

1552
01:29:48,853 --> 01:29:53,228
"What can I do my joys turned
into sorrows.."

1553
01:29:53,423 --> 01:29:57,468
"What can I do my joys turned
into sorrows.."

1554
01:29:57,838 --> 01:30:01,268
"What can I do my joys turned
into sorrows.."

1555
01:30:01,425 --> 01:30:02,468
Father-in-law.

1556
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:03,788
Father-in-law!

1557
01:30:03,976 --> 01:30:05,211
"What can I do my joys.."

1558
01:30:05,291 --> 01:30:06,308
Come dear, sit.

1559
01:30:06,633 --> 01:30:10,596
I haven't come here to sit, but
to give you your medicine.

1560
01:30:10,844 --> 01:30:11,708
Medicine!

1561
01:30:11,788 --> 01:30:13,357
Why, what's wrong with me?

1562
01:30:13,437 --> 01:30:16,748
You.. you are suffering
from pressure cooker.

1563
01:30:17,132 --> 01:30:18,628
Pressure cooker.
- Yes! - Me!

1564
01:30:19,072 --> 01:30:20,360
Speak softly, or else the
police will arrest you.

1565
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,108
Can any man have pressure cooker!
- No.

1566
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:23,948
What is it called in Hindi?

1567
01:30:24,391 --> 01:30:26,988
Yes, you have blood pressure.

1568
01:30:27,734 --> 01:30:28,788
Blood pressure!

1569
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:32,548
What is there to laugh?

1570
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:34,228
Father-in-law!

1571
01:30:34,787 --> 01:30:37,348
You should take this medicine
every morning, right?

1572
01:30:38,679 --> 01:30:39,708
Right!

1573
01:30:39,994 --> 01:30:41,308
Then why don't you take it.

1574
01:30:42,115 --> 01:30:44,028
Come on, take it.
- Not now dear.

1575
01:30:44,108 --> 01:30:45,261
I will take it later.

1576
01:30:45,341 --> 01:30:46,548
You go, I will take it later.
- You will have to take it.

1577
01:30:46,771 --> 01:30:47,868
Right now.

1578
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:54,788
Happy.

1579
01:30:55,548 --> 01:30:59,938
If you don't take your medicine
regularly from now on.

1580
01:31:00,311 --> 01:31:01,468
Then I will be very angry.

1581
01:31:01,548 --> 01:31:02,628
No dear.

1582
01:31:03,004 --> 01:31:04,948
Let the entire world be angry
with me, but not you.

1583
01:31:05,964 --> 01:31:08,051
But dear, tell me one thing.

1584
01:31:09,013 --> 01:31:10,388
Who told you that I
have blood pressure?

1585
01:31:10,723 --> 01:31:13,268
Who will tell me?

1586
01:31:13,448 --> 01:31:15,068
I live in this house father-in-law!

1587
01:31:15,443 --> 01:31:19,184
It is my duty to look
after this house.

1588
01:31:19,734 --> 01:31:22,788
And father-in-law, there
is one more thing.

1589
01:31:23,389 --> 01:31:24,388
Tell me dear.

1590
01:31:25,447 --> 01:31:27,713
Whether there is chaos or
destruction in the world.

1591
01:31:28,073 --> 01:31:30,430
Always be happy.

1592
01:31:36,231 --> 01:31:40,263
Dear, I was never happy before.

1593
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:44,171
But now that you have come,
I will surely be.

1594
01:31:45,337 --> 01:31:46,308
I will.

1595
01:31:47,674 --> 01:31:49,308
At least there is someone in this
house to take care of me.

1596
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:51,548
Go dear, go.

1597
01:31:53,973 --> 01:31:55,524
Good afternoon Mrs. Bhandari.

1598
01:31:57,806 --> 01:32:00,339
What a pleasant surprise,
chairman sir!

1599
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:03,228
No phone, no cable, when
did you arrive brother?

1600
01:32:03,308 --> 01:32:06,308
If I had known, I would've come
to the airport to receive you.

1601
01:32:07,598 --> 01:32:08,748
Take a seat.

1602
01:32:09,108 --> 01:32:10,068
No, no.

1603
01:32:10,183 --> 01:32:12,628
I don't have any right
to sit on that chair.

1604
01:32:12,786 --> 01:32:15,548
Because that chair belongs
to the managing director.

1605
01:32:15,628 --> 01:32:17,188
Okay, okay.
- You sit there.

1606
01:32:17,268 --> 01:32:18,388
And I will sit here.

1607
01:32:18,672 --> 01:32:20,788
You were supposed
to come next month.

1608
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:22,428
How did you return so soon?

1609
01:32:23,132 --> 01:32:25,458
That was my schedule, but the
chairman of Tokyo's firm..

1610
01:32:25,538 --> 01:32:27,528
..is here these days.

1611
01:32:28,153 --> 01:32:30,628
I have a very important
meeting with him today.

1612
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:34,179
If that meeting is successful, then
tonight we will leave for Frankfurt.

1613
01:32:34,795 --> 01:32:36,268
Leave these business talks aside.

1614
01:32:36,763 --> 01:32:41,708
Tell me, how is my friend, wife
devotee Mr. Kailash Bhandari.

1615
01:32:42,171 --> 01:32:43,268
Come on brother.

1616
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:44,866
He is very happy.

1617
01:32:45,065 --> 01:32:46,388
He always thinks about you.

1618
01:32:46,468 --> 01:32:49,200
But you don't get time to come home.

1619
01:32:49,548 --> 01:32:50,868
I will come the next time.
- Promise.

1620
01:32:51,242 --> 01:32:52,308
Promise.

1621
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:56,108
So madam Bhandari, tell me how
is your company running?

1622
01:32:56,595 --> 01:32:57,788
The company is running fine.

1623
01:32:58,028 --> 01:33:00,388
But I need some money
for a new business.

1624
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:04,108
Actually, the entire capital of
our company is in rotation.

1625
01:33:04,351 --> 01:33:06,628
I don't know what to do and
how to arrange for the money.

1626
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,011
Mrs. Bhandari this is foul.

1627
01:33:09,697 --> 01:33:11,788
You cannot say that
until I am there.

1628
01:33:12,657 --> 01:33:14,708
Don't forget, I am the chairman
of this company..

1629
01:33:14,788 --> 01:33:16,868
..and the financer too.

1630
01:33:17,025 --> 01:33:18,028
Oh yes.

1631
01:33:18,548 --> 01:33:20,748
Tell me,
how much money do you need.

1632
01:33:21,441 --> 01:33:22,708
Right now I need 10 lakh.

1633
01:33:22,788 --> 01:33:25,188
If I require more,
I will ask you for it.

1634
01:33:25,536 --> 01:33:28,188
O sure, why not.

1635
01:34:09,277 --> 01:34:10,388
Why did you leave the dance?

1636
01:34:11,461 --> 01:34:12,388
I was very tired.

1637
01:34:12,468 --> 01:34:13,788
Then order for something cold,
you will feel fresh!

1638
01:34:13,957 --> 01:34:15,722
Waiter!
- No, let it be.

1639
01:34:16,548 --> 01:34:19,215
Vicky, I had told you
something yesterday.

1640
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:23,673
I completely forgot about
it because of this disco.

1641
01:34:24,276 --> 01:34:25,868
Here, this sister-in-law 3,000.

1642
01:34:26,769 --> 01:34:27,787
Will this do?

1643
01:34:27,867 --> 01:34:29,028
Of course.

1644
01:34:29,308 --> 01:34:31,028
I have taken money from
you earlier too.

1645
01:34:31,339 --> 01:34:32,868
I will return it as soon
as I get daddy's draft.

1646
01:34:33,111 --> 01:34:34,108
Don't be silly.

1647
01:34:34,188 --> 01:34:35,948
Is there any difference between
your money and mine?

1648
01:34:36,447 --> 01:34:38,388
I can even give my life for you.

1649
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,948
Now come on.

1650
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:41,508
Let's go and dance, come on.

1651
01:34:41,588 --> 01:34:42,788
Come on.

1652
01:34:56,707 --> 01:34:58,948
Ramu! Sevak! Gopi!

1653
01:34:59,698 --> 01:35:00,708
Where are you all?

1654
01:35:00,788 --> 01:35:01,602
Yes Vicky sir.

1655
01:35:01,856 --> 01:35:03,348
Who did this to my room?

1656
01:35:03,669 --> 01:35:05,388
I will tell you brother-in-law.

1657
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:09,468
The happiness that you got seeing
the decoration of this room.

1658
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:12,024
I should be awarded for it.

1659
01:35:12,308 --> 01:35:13,388
Give me my reward.

1660
01:35:13,468 --> 01:35:16,708
I feel like giving you
such a fitting reward..

1661
01:35:17,338 --> 01:35:19,548
..that you will never dare
to come into my room again.

1662
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:21,341
Why? Why?

1663
01:35:21,518 --> 01:35:23,108
Have I made a mistake?

1664
01:35:23,238 --> 01:35:25,548
Look, you can do whatever
you want in this room!

1665
01:35:25,948 --> 01:35:27,028
I don't care!

1666
01:35:27,566 --> 01:35:29,388
Just like that, you shouldn't
have any relation..

1667
01:35:29,468 --> 01:35:30,920
..with me and my room!

1668
01:35:31,388 --> 01:35:33,925
If you try to lock horns with
me, then remember this..

1669
01:35:34,209 --> 01:35:35,344
..I am a very bad man.

1670
01:35:35,689 --> 01:35:37,653
You don't have to tell
me that brother-in-law.

1671
01:35:37,781 --> 01:35:38,868
What did you say?

1672
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,188
Vicky!

1673
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:41,748
Sister-in-law is considered
respectable!

1674
01:35:42,174 --> 01:35:43,188
And you are raising
your hand on her!

1675
01:35:43,476 --> 01:35:46,268
No, no it is not
brother-in-law's fault.

1676
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:49,188
It is my fault.

1677
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:52,108
Forgive me brother-in-law.

1678
01:35:53,226 --> 01:35:54,388
Forgive me.

1679
01:35:56,695 --> 01:35:57,748
You should be ashamed.

1680
01:36:00,926 --> 01:36:02,028
Who cares!

1681
01:36:02,353 --> 01:36:03,468
Gopi!

1682
01:36:03,659 --> 01:36:05,788
Ramu! Sevak!

1683
01:36:06,043 --> 01:36:06,948
Why doesn't anyone listen?

1684
01:36:07,028 --> 01:36:09,188
Has everyone gone deaf?
- Madam! Madam! Madam!

1685
01:36:09,268 --> 01:36:11,108
Sevak went to the
market a while ago.

1686
01:36:11,188 --> 01:36:12,716
Where are rest of them?

1687
01:36:12,857 --> 01:36:14,422
Don't they know there is a kitty
party in the house today?

1688
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:15,548
There is a lot
of work in the house!

1689
01:36:15,773 --> 01:36:18,078
How innocent, you don't
know anything.

1690
01:36:18,224 --> 01:36:18,884
What?

1691
01:36:19,044 --> 01:36:21,628
The servants of this house
have been given leave.

1692
01:36:21,825 --> 01:36:23,948
Leave!
- I mean dismiss.

1693
01:36:24,094 --> 01:36:26,388
I mean, they have been thrown
out of this house.

1694
01:36:26,468 --> 01:36:27,652
Who threw them out?

1695
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,323
Follow me.
- What?

1696
01:36:29,447 --> 01:36:30,468
Sorry, I mean I'll tell you.

1697
01:36:30,906 --> 01:36:32,558
Uneducated! Ignorant! Rude!

1698
01:36:32,638 --> 01:36:33,339
You are telling me!

1699
01:36:33,419 --> 01:36:35,851
No, your daughter-in-law.

1700
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:37,308
How dare she?

1701
01:36:37,558 --> 01:36:38,948
Hey secretary.

1702
01:36:39,587 --> 01:36:40,628
Here she comes.

1703
01:36:41,028 --> 01:36:42,948
Why do you provoke
her against me?

1704
01:36:43,501 --> 01:36:45,162
I have thrown the useless
servants out of the house..

1705
01:36:45,242 --> 01:36:46,548
..I haven't committed any sin.

1706
01:36:46,783 --> 01:36:48,788
Who are you to give
orders in this house?

1707
01:36:49,306 --> 01:36:51,388
Being the daughter-in-law
of this house..

1708
01:36:51,468 --> 01:36:53,948
..don't I have that much
right, mother-in-law?

1709
01:36:54,526 --> 01:36:57,028
I can see that you are
crossing your limits.

1710
01:36:57,318 --> 01:36:58,548
Is this your father's house?

1711
01:36:58,628 --> 01:37:01,188
Not, but it is my mother-in-law's
house.

1712
01:37:01,469 --> 01:37:03,256
And then I haven't committed
any crime.

1713
01:37:03,468 --> 01:37:05,560
A house where only 4 people live..

1714
01:37:05,707 --> 01:37:07,628
..what's the use of
8 servants there.

1715
01:37:07,748 --> 01:37:09,073
I do half the work.

1716
01:37:09,153 --> 01:37:11,268
Shut up!
- What's that?

1717
01:37:11,348 --> 01:37:12,708
Secretary!
- Yes madam.

1718
01:37:12,788 --> 01:37:13,593
Explain this ignorant woman!

1719
01:37:13,673 --> 01:37:16,308
Calm down! Calm down!
I mean, keep quiet!

1720
01:37:16,388 --> 01:37:17,865
Shut up means keep quiet.

1721
01:37:17,945 --> 01:37:21,388
Say it that way.

1722
01:37:21,468 --> 01:37:22,628
Secretary!
- Madam.

1723
01:37:22,708 --> 01:37:23,788
Follow me!
- Yes, yes.

1724
01:37:25,796 --> 01:37:28,188
There is an interesting story
behind this necklace.

1725
01:37:28,428 --> 01:37:30,499
I had gone to buy something else..

1726
01:37:30,579 --> 01:37:34,388
..in Trikamdas Khimji Zaveri's
shop, I spotted this necklace.

1727
01:37:34,508 --> 01:37:37,108
It is worth 5 lakh rupees.

1728
01:37:37,348 --> 01:37:39,868
This necklace was made
to order by someone.

1729
01:37:39,948 --> 01:37:41,281
Then how did you get it?

1730
01:37:41,361 --> 01:37:42,828
Why wouldn't he give it?

1731
01:37:42,969 --> 01:37:45,348
I told him clearly, if you don't
give me this necklace..

1732
01:37:45,428 --> 01:37:48,748
..the I won't come to your
shop the next time!

1733
01:37:49,036 --> 01:37:50,906
And poor guy, gave it to me.

1734
01:37:51,301 --> 01:37:54,148
And anyway, I am their
regular customer.

1735
01:37:55,131 --> 01:37:56,602
You are really great Kamla.

1736
01:37:56,885 --> 01:38:00,338
Wherever you go, you get your
work done with your influence.

1737
01:38:02,327 --> 01:38:04,765
Leela, why are you sitting
with a sad face?

1738
01:38:05,098 --> 01:38:06,454
I am not in the mood at all.

1739
01:38:06,924 --> 01:38:07,468
Why?

1740
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:09,068
What shall I tell you?

1741
01:38:09,451 --> 01:38:11,508
When there is a ignorant
daughter-in-law in the house.

1742
01:38:11,831 --> 01:38:14,068
Then how can the mother-in-law
be happy.

1743
01:38:14,316 --> 01:38:16,148
We argue everyday for something.

1744
01:38:16,332 --> 01:38:18,828
Now you tell me, I am the
owner of this house.

1745
01:38:19,191 --> 01:38:20,708
And she gives the orders.

1746
01:38:21,068 --> 01:38:22,828
How can I be in a good mood then?

1747
01:38:23,347 --> 01:38:25,429
Kamla, who is she?

1748
01:38:25,681 --> 01:38:26,828
I never saw her before.

1749
01:38:26,908 --> 01:38:28,566
Her! She is our new maid!

1750
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:33,748
She is very decked up.

1751
01:38:34,185 --> 01:38:36,596
Mrs. Bhandari, be careful.

1752
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:39,357
In a house of bachelor boys,
such maids sometimes..

1753
01:38:39,437 --> 01:38:40,828
..play their tricks.

1754
01:38:42,562 --> 01:38:43,687
Why are you sitting here?

1755
01:38:43,767 --> 01:38:46,708
Then should I sit on your lap!

1756
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:48,308
There was space, so I sat here.

1757
01:38:49,232 --> 01:38:50,028
Will you have grams?

1758
01:38:50,108 --> 01:38:51,308
It is good for your metabolism.

1759
01:38:51,388 --> 01:38:53,548
Seems like she has forgotten
her position.

1760
01:38:54,177 --> 01:38:55,748
I know my position.

1761
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:57,308
Isn't it mother-in-law?

1762
01:38:57,388 --> 01:38:59,468
Mother-in-law!
- Yes.

1763
01:38:59,585 --> 01:39:01,828
Kamla, what nonsense
is your maid talking?

1764
01:39:01,974 --> 01:39:05,862
Excuse me madam,
don't be deceived!

1765
01:39:06,068 --> 01:39:09,308
I am not the maid, but the
madam of this house!

1766
01:39:09,483 --> 01:39:11,148
I mean, daughter-in-law.

1767
01:39:12,195 --> 01:39:14,708
Mother-in-law, why don't
you tell them?

1768
01:39:14,938 --> 01:39:17,908
Okay, if you don't then
I will tell them.

1769
01:39:18,691 --> 01:39:19,908
Listen carefully.

1770
01:39:20,548 --> 01:39:26,674
I am the wife of his
elder son, Suraj.

1771
01:39:27,698 --> 01:39:31,628
And I know all of you quite nicely.

1772
01:39:32,591 --> 01:39:38,108
All of you come here to brag or
to insult your daughter-in-laws.

1773
01:39:38,459 --> 01:39:41,708
And that's what you teach
my mother-in-law too.

1774
01:39:42,545 --> 01:39:44,286
But listen carefully.

1775
01:39:44,748 --> 01:39:47,428
If that's what you want
to do, then from today..

1776
01:39:47,666 --> 01:39:50,548
..you are not welcome
in this house!

1777
01:39:50,988 --> 01:39:52,228
Did you understand?
You didn't understand!

1778
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:53,828
This is too much.

1779
01:39:53,908 --> 01:39:56,068
Come on, to hell with
this kitty party.

1780
01:39:56,216 --> 01:39:57,548
We will not come here again.

1781
01:39:57,708 --> 01:39:59,828
Where are you all going?
Please stay.

1782
01:39:59,955 --> 01:40:01,508
Why should we stay?

1783
01:40:01,712 --> 01:40:03,138
Your daughter-in-law
insulted us so much..

1784
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:06,197
..but you didn't say a word.

1785
01:40:06,379 --> 01:40:07,188
Shame on you!

1786
01:40:07,324 --> 01:40:08,508
Come on!

1787
01:40:08,716 --> 01:40:09,988
Listen.

1788
01:40:10,148 --> 01:40:12,308
Keep listening to your
daughter-in-law.

1789
01:40:17,996 --> 01:40:21,228
Mother-in-law, did I
commit any mistake.

1790
01:40:21,821 --> 01:40:22,948
I only said the truth.

1791
01:40:23,028 --> 01:40:24,108
Stop this nonsense!

1792
01:40:25,095 --> 01:40:29,028
You defamed me in front
of my friends.

1793
01:40:29,505 --> 01:40:32,988
Today I will bring
you under control.

1794
01:40:34,254 --> 01:40:34,988
Mother-in-law!

1795
01:40:35,068 --> 01:40:38,168
I have taught a lesson
to many with this whip!

1796
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:40,858
If I don't teach you
a lesson today..

1797
01:40:40,938 --> 01:40:42,923
..then my name isn't Kamla!

1798
01:40:46,677 --> 01:40:50,068
Don't think I am a helpless
woman, mother-in-law.

1799
01:40:50,417 --> 01:40:54,628
I am a strong village girl.

1800
01:40:55,425 --> 01:40:58,988
If I make a mistake, then you
can punish me in anyway.

1801
01:40:59,578 --> 01:41:00,828
I won't say anything.

1802
01:41:01,421 --> 01:41:05,308
But if you ever raise your hand
on Shalu without any reason..

1803
01:41:06,641 --> 01:41:08,308
..then be prepared for
the consequences.

1804
01:41:13,378 --> 01:41:14,388
Secretary!

1805
01:41:14,948 --> 01:41:16,308
Save me!

1806
01:41:17,225 --> 01:41:18,628
Fool! Idiot!
- I know!

1807
01:41:19,264 --> 01:41:22,988
She is not weak and delicate
like the city girls.

1808
01:41:23,429 --> 01:41:25,849
She is a solid woman of the village.

1809
01:41:25,929 --> 01:41:27,468
Please excuse me madam.

1810
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:30,476
If woman would have
been a solid thing..

1811
01:41:30,556 --> 01:41:33,737
..then her name would have been
Dara Singh, Dilawar Khan..

1812
01:41:33,817 --> 01:41:35,188
..Muhammad Ali etcetera.

1813
01:41:35,373 --> 01:41:38,125
Women are delicate.

1814
01:41:38,289 --> 01:41:40,514
She doesn't have any value
in front of a man.

1815
01:41:40,594 --> 01:41:41,844
No, no, except for you.

1816
01:41:41,924 --> 01:41:44,161
Not every woman can be Mrs.
Kamla Bhandari.

1817
01:41:44,241 --> 01:41:45,188
Don't talk nonsense!

1818
01:41:45,366 --> 01:41:48,428
I am getting furious, and you
are blabbering nonsense.

1819
01:41:48,978 --> 01:41:51,548
Think of an idea to defame her..

1820
01:41:52,182 --> 01:41:55,108
..so that the work is done
without much effort.

1821
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:57,748
I have an action idea.

1822
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,185
With your permission can I say?
- Quickly.

1823
01:42:00,265 --> 01:42:03,228
Look madam, when things cannot
be done the right way..

1824
01:42:03,308 --> 01:42:06,558
..then it's best to
use wrong methods.

1825
01:42:06,868 --> 01:42:09,552
The idea is to shatter her pride.

1826
01:42:10,283 --> 01:42:13,992
Then why don't we hire some
goons and teach her a lesson.

1827
01:42:14,554 --> 01:42:15,588
There you are.

1828
01:42:16,123 --> 01:42:17,428
The idea is not bad.

1829
01:42:18,241 --> 01:42:21,149
But we have to be very careful.

1830
01:42:21,229 --> 01:42:23,788
Don't worry, no one
will know about it.

1831
01:42:24,184 --> 01:42:27,788
Just that, she should go
out of the house alone.

1832
01:42:28,296 --> 01:42:29,228
Alone!

1833
01:42:30,321 --> 01:42:31,868
That can happen only on Tuesday.

1834
01:42:32,564 --> 01:42:35,228
Because she goes to the
temple for veneration.

1835
01:42:35,815 --> 01:42:37,508
Then let Tuesday be the day.

1836
01:42:39,769 --> 01:42:41,748
Come! Come!

1837
01:42:55,610 --> 01:42:58,908
What is it brother, do
you want the offering?

1838
01:42:59,528 --> 01:42:59,913
..Here.

1839
01:42:59,993 --> 01:43:02,572
No dear, we want you
not the offering.

1840
01:43:02,652 --> 01:43:03,708
Wait, wait.

1841
01:43:04,656 --> 01:43:06,822
You want me, isn't it?
- Yes.

1842
01:43:06,902 --> 01:43:08,343
Then I will come along with you.

1843
01:43:08,698 --> 01:43:09,708
Just a minute.

1844
01:44:07,454 --> 01:44:09,156
Hail Lord Krishna!

1845
01:44:55,606 --> 01:44:57,628
Tell me! Who sent you here?

1846
01:44:58,243 --> 01:45:00,228
Tell me, or else I will kill you!

1847
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:01,388
Tell me!

1848
01:45:01,468 --> 01:45:03,908
I will tell you! I will tell
you! I will tell you!

1849
01:45:04,146 --> 01:45:05,068
I will tell you!

1850
01:45:05,597 --> 01:45:07,748
Thank God you weren't hurt
much sister-in-law.

1851
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:10,148
Shalu!

1852
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:11,548
What happened, why have
you tied a bandage?

1853
01:45:11,795 --> 01:45:13,109
Sister-in-law was hurt brother.

1854
01:45:13,341 --> 01:45:16,428
Hurt! Shalu, again you..
- Why are you worried?

1855
01:45:16,981 --> 01:45:19,006
I didn't fight with anyone.

1856
01:45:19,086 --> 01:45:22,046
I had gone to the temple, and there
are monkeys in the temple.

1857
01:45:22,126 --> 01:45:24,589
Seeing the offering in my
hands they came before me.

1858
01:45:24,669 --> 01:45:28,419
While shooing them off,
I slipped and fell!

1859
01:45:28,934 --> 01:45:30,150
Is it paining a lot?

1860
01:45:30,230 --> 01:45:30,988
Shall I call the doctor?

1861
01:45:31,165 --> 01:45:33,496
Doctor! What will the doctor do?

1862
01:45:33,576 --> 01:45:35,751
I have applied clarified
butter and turmeric!

1863
01:45:35,915 --> 01:45:37,798
Even the biggest wounds heal.

1864
01:45:38,715 --> 01:45:41,096
And until I have the grace
of Lord Krishna..

1865
01:45:41,176 --> 01:45:43,708
..and the blessings
of my mother-in-law.

1866
01:45:43,993 --> 01:45:46,489
No one can harm me.

1867
01:45:46,936 --> 01:45:47,947
Isn't it secretary?

1868
01:45:48,027 --> 01:45:51,106
Yes, blessings are very powerful
like electricity.

1869
01:45:51,186 --> 01:45:52,080
Secretary!
- Madam!

1870
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:54,588
Follow me.
- That way.

1871
01:45:55,544 --> 01:45:57,694
Pinky, how long will we
keep meeting like this?

1872
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:01,780
I want to get rid of this
distance between us.

1873
01:46:02,498 --> 01:46:03,988
And come along with me to
my home day after tomorrow.

1874
01:46:04,226 --> 01:46:05,357
I will introduce you to my mummy.

1875
01:46:05,574 --> 01:46:06,548
Why is that?

1876
01:46:06,686 --> 01:46:09,788
Until mummy doesn't see how..

1877
01:46:09,868 --> 01:46:13,828
..how can she say yes for
our marriage? - Marriage!

1878
01:46:14,737 --> 01:46:17,639
But Vicky, what's the
haste to get married.

1879
01:46:18,259 --> 01:46:20,828
Right now.. That's fine.

1880
01:46:21,327 --> 01:46:23,117
What's the objection
in meeting mummy?

1881
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:25,199
She is going to like you.

1882
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:28,708
That's fine, but I don't have
a proper dress to wear.

1883
01:46:30,689 --> 01:46:32,810
And how can I meet your
mother is these clothes?

1884
01:46:33,297 --> 01:46:34,405
That is no problem.

1885
01:46:34,817 --> 01:46:35,788
You don't have clothes.

1886
01:46:36,754 --> 01:46:38,867
But there are a lot of
clothes in the shops.

1887
01:46:39,914 --> 01:46:42,525
Finish this, after that I
will take you for shopping!

1888
01:46:42,693 --> 01:46:44,545
Buy anything. Okay.
- Okay.

1889
01:46:44,625 --> 01:46:45,788
Let us go. Drink it quickly.

1890
01:46:46,628 --> 01:46:47,723
Flop! Flop! Flop!

1891
01:46:47,882 --> 01:46:51,269
Every idea of your flops
in front of that girl! - I know.

1892
01:46:51,388 --> 01:46:54,779
She is always two steps
ahead of you. - I know.

1893
01:46:54,859 --> 01:46:56,312
She has made my life hell!

1894
01:46:56,392 --> 01:46:57,664
I don't know what to do!

1895
01:46:57,744 --> 01:46:59,911
Sorry madam, even I can't
understand what to do.

1896
01:46:59,991 --> 01:47:01,515
Die of shame!

1897
01:47:01,745 --> 01:47:03,886
You can't think of a good idea.

1898
01:47:04,054 --> 01:47:04,908
That's it.

1899
01:47:05,082 --> 01:47:06,522
I have it madam, I have it.
- What?

1900
01:47:06,602 --> 01:47:09,508
As you said die of shame,
an idea immerged..

1901
01:47:09,588 --> 01:47:11,508
..from the depths of my mind..

1902
01:47:11,588 --> 01:47:14,000
Then say it, you fool!

1903
01:47:14,124 --> 01:47:15,068
Madam, not here.

1904
01:47:15,251 --> 01:47:16,612
Anyone can hear it!

1905
01:47:16,736 --> 01:47:18,132
Follow me.
- Secretary!

1906
01:47:18,212 --> 01:47:19,435
My mistake!
I mean, come here.

1907
01:47:19,515 --> 01:47:20,752
Say that.
- My mistake.

1908
01:47:24,828 --> 01:47:27,308
It is such a beautiful
place, isn't it?

1909
01:47:28,554 --> 01:47:30,348
That's fine,
mother-in-law.

1910
01:47:31,013 --> 01:47:33,596
But I cannot understand one thing.

1911
01:47:34,084 --> 01:47:37,828
Why are you so grateful to me?

1912
01:47:39,083 --> 01:47:41,052
It is not that confusing dear.

1913
01:47:41,553 --> 01:47:43,551
The relation of a mother-in-law
and daughter-in-law..

1914
01:47:43,631 --> 01:47:44,828
..is stronger than the relation
of mother and daughter.

1915
01:47:44,908 --> 01:47:46,471
That's right!

1916
01:47:46,995 --> 01:47:47,908
That's right!

1917
01:47:48,103 --> 01:47:50,398
And there isn't any
mother in the world..

1918
01:47:50,478 --> 01:47:52,005
..who won't be grateful
to her daughter.

1919
01:47:53,526 --> 01:47:58,220
Just wait here for a while, I will
arrange for something to eat.

1920
01:47:58,300 --> 01:47:59,068
Okay.
- Nice.

1921
01:47:59,148 --> 01:48:00,228
Don't go anywhere, stay here.

1922
01:48:11,916 --> 01:48:13,369
Mother-in-law!
- Save me!

1923
01:48:13,449 --> 01:48:14,468
Mother-in-law!

1924
01:48:19,255 --> 01:48:22,676
Doctor sir, what's the
condition of my wife?

1925
01:48:24,293 --> 01:48:26,388
Slowly, why are you
taking the trouble?

1926
01:48:26,745 --> 01:48:29,348
I mean..
- There is nothing to be scared.

1927
01:48:29,607 --> 01:48:30,788
It is a mild attack of pneumonia.

1928
01:48:31,207 --> 01:48:32,028
She will be fine soon.

1929
01:48:32,283 --> 01:48:33,748
She will be fine!
- Sure.

1930
01:48:34,278 --> 01:48:35,228
No, I was just..

1931
01:48:35,705 --> 01:48:37,098
Okay Mr. Bhandari,
I will leave now.

1932
01:48:37,353 --> 01:48:38,308
I will come again in the evening.

1933
01:48:38,471 --> 01:48:39,891
It's fine even if you don't come.

1934
01:48:39,971 --> 01:48:42,618
I mean.. such a big injection
it will pain here.

1935
01:48:43,148 --> 01:48:45,070
But mummy, what was the need
for you to go to the river.

1936
01:48:46,902 --> 01:48:48,410
I was getting bored at home.

1937
01:48:48,490 --> 01:48:49,863
You were getting bored.
- Yes.

1938
01:48:50,199 --> 01:48:52,416
I thought it will be
a nice outing.

1939
01:48:52,817 --> 01:48:54,890
And I will take
daughter-in-law out too.

1940
01:48:55,422 --> 01:48:56,388
Inside the water.

1941
01:48:56,583 --> 01:48:57,708
Tell me one thing.

1942
01:48:58,140 --> 01:48:59,540
How did you fall in the water?

1943
01:49:00,082 --> 01:49:01,146
The water is very scared of you.

1944
01:49:01,226 --> 01:49:03,370
I mean, you are very
scared of water.

1945
01:49:03,774 --> 01:49:07,398
Daddy, someone must have
surely pushed mummy.

1946
01:49:10,131 --> 01:49:13,328
Shall I tell them the truth,
mother-in-law?

1947
01:49:14,374 --> 01:49:16,292
Why are you all so worried?

1948
01:49:16,752 --> 01:49:20,272
I slipped near the shore of the
river and I fell in the water.

1949
01:49:20,796 --> 01:49:22,272
You slipped.
- Yes.

1950
01:49:22,434 --> 01:49:23,512
That means,
along with the tongue..

1951
01:49:23,592 --> 01:49:25,136
..now you can't even control
your feet, isn't it?

1952
01:49:25,216 --> 01:49:27,432
Mr. Bhandari!
- I was just giving an example.

1953
01:49:27,512 --> 01:49:28,872
Every joke has a limit.

1954
01:49:29,587 --> 01:49:30,506
Vicky.

1955
01:49:30,586 --> 01:49:32,192
Why don't you understand
my feelings?

1956
01:49:33,991 --> 01:49:35,032
I love you.

1957
01:49:35,712 --> 01:49:37,632
But even though we stay
under the same roof.

1958
01:49:38,069 --> 01:49:39,352
We are strangers to each other.

1959
01:49:40,192 --> 01:49:41,872
I love you Vicky, I love you.

1960
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:43,352
Aarti!

1961
01:49:43,984 --> 01:49:45,272
What are you doing in my room?

1962
01:49:47,165 --> 01:49:48,496
Staying in the company
of the ignorant woman..

1963
01:49:48,576 --> 01:49:49,712
..you are becoming ignorant too!

1964
01:49:50,622 --> 01:49:52,272
I ask you, why do you
trouble me always?

1965
01:49:52,778 --> 01:49:54,272
Because I love you.

1966
01:49:54,537 --> 01:49:56,894
But I love someone else.

1967
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,472
I hate you!

1968
01:49:58,783 --> 01:49:59,792
Do you understand?

1969
01:49:59,872 --> 01:50:00,792
I hate you!

1970
01:50:00,872 --> 01:50:02,112
Get out of here.

1971
01:50:03,872 --> 01:50:06,112
Vicky, someone has instigated you.

1972
01:50:06,382 --> 01:50:08,062
Now stop this nonsense, stop it!

1973
01:50:08,318 --> 01:50:11,032
Look Aarti, I will not tolerate
you in my room again.

1974
01:50:11,247 --> 01:50:12,352
Don't come here!

1975
01:50:12,632 --> 01:50:13,952
Why are you still standing here?

1976
01:50:14,032 --> 01:50:14,806
Get out! Get lost!

1977
01:50:14,965 --> 01:50:18,432
I could never have thought, you
will behave like this with me.

1978
01:50:18,591 --> 01:50:21,352
I am going! I will never
bother you again.

1979
01:50:22,032 --> 01:50:23,272
I will not love you too.

1980
01:50:24,032 --> 01:50:25,192
You hate me, don't you?

1981
01:50:25,744 --> 01:50:26,952
I will hate you too!

1982
01:50:27,569 --> 01:50:29,472
Now I won't come back
even if you call me!

1983
01:50:30,068 --> 01:50:31,872
I will never return!
I will never return!

1984
01:50:35,992 --> 01:50:39,512
Aarti, tears are the
symbol of cowardice.

1985
01:50:39,912 --> 01:50:41,072
Yes I am a coward,
sister-in-law.

1986
01:50:41,621 --> 01:50:43,907
I have lost and my heart
has been shattered.

1987
01:50:44,517 --> 01:50:45,912
Yes, I know.

1988
01:50:46,912 --> 01:50:49,257
My brother-in-law has broken
your heart, isn't it? - Yes.

1989
01:50:49,774 --> 01:50:50,832
So what?

1990
01:50:51,361 --> 01:50:54,992
There are sorrows and happiness
on the path of love.

1991
01:50:55,701 --> 01:50:58,370
But Vicky hates me
sister-in-law.

1992
01:50:58,693 --> 01:51:00,752
Some other girl
dwells in his heart.

1993
01:51:02,432 --> 01:51:03,512
Who is she?

1994
01:51:03,752 --> 01:51:04,832
I don't know.

1995
01:51:04,912 --> 01:51:07,752
Whoever she is, she can't
be sweeter than you!

1996
01:51:08,071 --> 01:51:10,974
Because you love
my brother-in-law.

1997
01:51:11,176 --> 01:51:13,166
And love is very strong.

1998
01:51:13,375 --> 01:51:15,672
One day he will surely melt.

1999
01:51:16,018 --> 01:51:18,213
But he is so heartless.

2000
01:51:19,815 --> 01:51:23,832
Foolish, everyone has
feelings in his heart.

2001
01:51:24,413 --> 01:51:25,392
Have patience.

2002
01:51:25,512 --> 01:51:27,352
I will tell you what to do.

2003
01:51:27,536 --> 01:51:29,432
Wipe your tears, and come with me.

2004
01:51:29,972 --> 01:51:32,072
Sanjay, you take everything lightly.

2005
01:51:32,399 --> 01:51:33,392
Why don't you understand?

2006
01:51:33,472 --> 01:51:34,832
The matter is very serious.

2007
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,352
I understand everything, darling.

2008
01:51:36,575 --> 01:51:38,232
Let this act continue
for some more time.

2009
01:51:38,355 --> 01:51:39,912
It is for our own benefit.

2010
01:51:40,352 --> 01:51:41,832
This act cannot continue any longer.

2011
01:51:42,709 --> 01:51:44,992
I fooled Vicky as much as I can.

2012
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:47,512
He is getting serious day-by-day.

2013
01:51:48,072 --> 01:51:51,280
He is going to take me along with
him to introduce me to his mummy.

2014
01:51:51,933 --> 01:51:53,232
And I cannot do that.

2015
01:51:55,843 --> 01:51:57,442
I love you Sanjay.

2016
01:51:58,054 --> 01:52:01,281
Think of something, how can
we solve this problem?

2017
01:52:01,912 --> 01:52:02,992
He must be arriving.

2018
01:52:03,496 --> 01:52:04,592
Then come on, let
us go to the beach.

2019
01:52:05,007 --> 01:52:06,072
We will think of something there.

2020
01:52:06,377 --> 01:52:07,432
Okay.
- Come on.

2021
01:52:16,346 --> 01:52:17,432
Aarti.

2022
01:52:18,392 --> 01:52:19,512
Follow him!

2023
01:52:19,592 --> 01:52:21,512
And find out who the
wicked woman is..

2024
01:52:21,592 --> 01:52:23,312
..that's creating an obstruction
in the path of your love!

2025
01:52:23,433 --> 01:52:24,912
But sister-in-law.
- No ifs and buts.

2026
01:52:24,992 --> 01:52:26,512
Go quickly. I am telling you.

2027
01:52:32,821 --> 01:52:34,152
Listen Sangita.
- Yes.

2028
01:52:34,335 --> 01:52:35,512
Have you seen Pinky?

2029
01:52:36,012 --> 01:52:37,072
Maybe she has gone
on the beach.

2030
01:52:37,152 --> 01:52:38,232
Which way?
- This way.

2031
01:52:38,344 --> 01:52:39,512
This way!
- Yes

2032
01:52:45,165 --> 01:52:47,432
Darling,
I don't want to meet Vicky.

2033
01:52:48,152 --> 01:52:50,427
This problem should be solved
anyhow, understood.

2034
01:52:50,966 --> 01:52:52,832
Don't worry darling, I will
take care of Vicky.

2035
01:52:53,568 --> 01:52:54,592
Pinky!

2036
01:52:55,578 --> 01:52:56,592
Vicky!

2037
01:53:00,995 --> 01:53:04,127
You cheat! Deceiver!
You betrayed me!

2038
01:53:04,207 --> 01:53:05,512
I will kill you!
- You!

2039
01:53:06,990 --> 01:53:08,232
I won't spare you too!

2040
01:54:23,187 --> 01:54:25,592
Scoundrel! You rascal!

2041
01:54:31,568 --> 01:54:32,543
No!

2042
01:54:32,623 --> 01:54:34,590
Cheat! Betrayer! I
will not spare you!

2043
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:35,696
Vicky!

2044
01:54:40,199 --> 01:54:41,592
Aarti!
- Vicky!

2045
01:54:41,732 --> 01:54:43,544
Aarti, what did you do?

2046
01:54:43,887 --> 01:54:45,761
Vicky I..
- What did you do Aarti?

2047
01:54:46,072 --> 01:54:48,192
I have answered your hatred, Vicky!

2048
01:54:48,542 --> 01:54:50,992
No Aarti, I will not let you die.

2049
01:55:16,752 --> 01:55:17,992
Doctor sir, how is Aarti?

2050
01:55:18,431 --> 01:55:20,592
We cannot say anything until the
patient doesn't regain conscious.

2051
01:55:21,101 --> 01:55:22,152
We are trying our best.

2052
01:55:22,763 --> 01:55:25,556
Get this injection.
- Okay.

2053
01:55:26,392 --> 01:55:28,472
I will get the injection,
don't worry.

2054
01:55:37,243 --> 01:55:42,392
Lord, till today I haven't
done any good work in life.

2055
01:55:43,093 --> 01:55:45,923
But still I beg of you
for Aarti's life.

2056
01:55:48,101 --> 01:55:49,232
Save her Lord!

2057
01:55:50,593 --> 01:55:51,752
Save her!

2058
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:53,592
Brother-in-law!

2059
01:55:54,952 --> 01:56:01,592
You are pleading for
that girl's life.

2060
01:56:02,391 --> 01:56:04,552
Don't be a fool, brother-in-law.

2061
01:56:04,632 --> 01:56:06,192
Let that unfortunate girl die!

2062
01:56:06,832 --> 01:56:10,392
She has no one in this
world to cry for her!

2063
01:56:11,339 --> 01:56:15,072
Brother-in-law, you kept
hating her all your life.

2064
01:56:15,764 --> 01:56:17,872
Then why is there sadness
on your face.

2065
01:56:18,023 --> 01:56:20,352
Who are you pleading for,
brother-in-law?

2066
01:56:21,442 --> 01:56:26,217
For her sister-in-law, whose love
I could never understand.

2067
01:56:27,386 --> 01:56:30,032
For saving my life,
she risked her life.

2068
01:56:31,712 --> 01:56:35,392
If something happens to her,
then I will die too.

2069
01:56:35,988 --> 01:56:37,483
I will die too, sister-in-law.

2070
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,032
Don't worry brother-in-law.

2071
01:56:42,119 --> 01:56:43,687
Nothing will happen to Aarti.

2072
01:56:44,828 --> 01:56:47,512
The love for her in your heart.

2073
01:56:48,617 --> 01:56:51,708
It will heal her wounds.

2074
01:56:52,832 --> 01:56:53,872
Yes.

2075
01:56:54,179 --> 01:56:57,352
Sister-in-law, I misunderstood
you too.

2076
01:56:58,789 --> 01:56:59,752
Forgive me sister-in-law.

2077
01:56:59,832 --> 01:57:01,192
What are you doing brother-in-law?

2078
01:57:02,059 --> 01:57:03,703
Humans make mistakes.

2079
01:57:04,269 --> 01:57:05,272
Not Lords.

2080
01:57:06,069 --> 01:57:07,432
Shalu, doctor says
there is no danger..

2081
01:57:07,512 --> 01:57:08,796
..Aarti has regained conscious.

2082
01:57:08,876 --> 01:57:09,872
You go!

2083
01:57:12,431 --> 01:57:13,605
Thank God!

2084
01:57:14,209 --> 01:57:15,832
My brother-in-law has
come to his senses too.

2085
01:57:19,379 --> 01:57:20,604
Wow madam, wow.

2086
01:57:20,778 --> 01:57:21,752
You are great.

2087
01:57:21,872 --> 01:57:25,752
Whenever I see you sitting with
all the family members.

2088
01:57:25,909 --> 01:57:28,512
I think about the great
empress Noorjahan!

2089
01:57:28,672 --> 01:57:32,112
She used to sit like this
in her court. I tell you.

2090
01:57:32,192 --> 01:57:33,352
Secretary sir.
- Yes.

2091
01:57:33,592 --> 01:57:35,832
Where did you see empress
Noorjahan's court?

2092
01:57:35,912 --> 01:57:37,593
You must have seen it in heaven.

2093
01:57:39,050 --> 01:57:40,272
Great!

2094
01:57:40,512 --> 01:57:42,752
Seeing all the members
sitting together

2095
01:57:42,832 --> 01:57:45,512
Talking to each other, it
is such a pleasant sight!

2096
01:57:45,930 --> 01:57:47,592
Here mother-in-law, offering.

2097
01:57:48,378 --> 01:57:49,352
Take it.

2098
01:57:49,432 --> 01:57:51,272
Why are you distributing sweets?

2099
01:57:51,592 --> 01:57:52,672
I had asked for a boon.

2100
01:57:52,817 --> 01:57:53,912
This offering is for that.

2101
01:57:54,432 --> 01:57:55,431
Can I have it?

2102
01:57:55,559 --> 01:57:56,832
Yes, why not.

2103
01:57:57,270 --> 01:58:00,832
You should give the offering
to the beggars first.

2104
01:58:01,232 --> 01:58:03,032
Secretary. Here.

2105
01:58:03,112 --> 01:58:04,511
Thank you.

2106
01:58:04,821 --> 01:58:07,952
At least someone started the
tradition of offerings and boons.

2107
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:10,832
But dear, what boon
had you asked for?

2108
01:58:11,032 --> 01:58:12,592
For the marriage of
my brother-in-law.

2109
01:58:12,797 --> 01:58:13,832
He has agreed.

2110
01:58:13,912 --> 01:58:16,192
Now we will get him
married very grandly.

2111
01:58:16,272 --> 01:58:17,352
Isn't it brother-in-law..
- What did you say?

2112
01:58:17,972 --> 01:58:20,832
Who are you to decide
my son's marriage?

2113
01:58:21,368 --> 01:58:25,832
I will get him married. To Mr.
Bhanupratap's daughter.

2114
01:58:26,110 --> 01:58:30,592
That will bring a lot.. - She will
bring a flow of money in this house.

2115
01:58:30,853 --> 01:58:32,230
And we will have to change
the name of this house..

2116
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:33,512
..from Swarg to Gangotri.

2117
01:58:33,812 --> 01:58:36,512
I don't want wealth daddy,
I don't want to be lost in it.

2118
01:58:37,533 --> 01:58:41,552
And that's why I have
decided to marry..

2119
01:58:41,716 --> 01:58:44,672
..an orphan and helpless girl.

2120
01:58:44,924 --> 01:58:45,912
Who is that girl?

2121
01:58:48,408 --> 01:58:49,592
She is standing before you, mummy.

2122
01:58:54,296 --> 01:58:55,919
She! This girl!

2123
01:58:56,352 --> 01:58:58,752
We brought her up, and now..

2124
01:58:58,832 --> 01:59:01,272
..she will be the daughter-in-law
of this house!

2125
01:59:02,512 --> 01:59:04,272
Have you gone mad!

2126
01:59:04,656 --> 01:59:07,512
No mummy, I was mad
but now I am fine.

2127
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:11,432
And now I have decided,
I will marry only Aarti.

2128
01:59:11,672 --> 01:59:16,272
It's not you, but this ignorant
woman speaking!

2129
01:59:17,031 --> 01:59:19,832
You have learnt to
misbehave from her.

2130
01:59:19,912 --> 01:59:22,432
Mummy, learn to speak properly.

2131
01:59:23,099 --> 01:59:25,112
Sister-in-law is considered
respectable.

2132
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:29,672
Bravo son, for the first time
you have talked sense.

2133
01:59:30,289 --> 01:59:31,432
Secretary!
- Madam.

2134
01:59:31,512 --> 01:59:32,592
Follow me.
- Definitely.

2135
01:59:37,494 --> 01:59:38,552
Daughter-in-law.

2136
01:59:39,101 --> 01:59:40,232
Give me this offering first.

2137
01:59:40,312 --> 01:59:42,112
I will sweeten my mouth first.
- Here.

2138
01:59:46,555 --> 01:59:53,552
"No body should cast
an evil eye on you.."

2139
01:59:53,992 --> 01:59:56,637
"You are very beautiful.."

2140
01:59:59,331 --> 02:00:01,472
Stop this music!
- Sorry, sorry!

2141
02:00:01,552 --> 02:00:03,002
I was just trying
to divert your mind, madam.

2142
02:00:03,152 --> 02:00:06,472
Tonight is a very painful
night for me!

2143
02:00:06,844 --> 02:00:08,832
I didn't expect this from Vicky,
at least.

2144
02:00:08,912 --> 02:00:09,992
No, no madam.

2145
02:00:10,301 --> 02:00:13,312
If you ask me, then it
is not Vicky's fault.

2146
02:00:13,633 --> 02:00:15,752
He has been instigated against you.

2147
02:00:16,009 --> 02:00:17,383
And it is entirely that
woman's doing..

2148
02:00:17,463 --> 02:00:18,152
- You are right.

2149
02:00:18,336 --> 02:00:22,072
What magic does she have,
that enchants everyone.

2150
02:00:22,275 --> 02:00:23,392
Like P.C Sarkar.

2151
02:00:23,752 --> 02:00:24,872
Great magician.

2152
02:00:25,289 --> 02:00:28,152
One by one,
she has captivated everyone.

2153
02:00:28,302 --> 02:00:29,472
Only Vicky was remaining.

2154
02:00:29,689 --> 02:00:31,352
But today he was captivated too.

2155
02:00:31,432 --> 02:00:32,187
What?

2156
02:00:32,267 --> 02:00:34,992
I mean, he was enchanted
by her too.

2157
02:00:35,330 --> 02:00:37,592
The only thing that's
troubling you..

2158
02:00:37,672 --> 02:00:40,952
..is that simple girl
has made my life hell!

2159
02:00:41,032 --> 02:00:41,992
Get rid of her.

2160
02:00:42,255 --> 02:00:43,152
What do you mean?

2161
02:00:43,232 --> 02:00:44,912
You are misunderstanding me madam.

2162
02:00:45,077 --> 02:00:48,152
I have such a great idea,
that will get rid of her.

2163
02:00:48,278 --> 02:00:49,312
What's that?

2164
02:00:53,195 --> 02:00:53,832
Sorry!

2165
02:00:54,052 --> 02:00:54,992
Secretary.
- Madam!

2166
02:00:55,143 --> 02:00:56,152
Follow me.
- Definitely.

2167
02:00:56,804 --> 02:00:57,832
Wherever you say!

2168
02:00:57,912 --> 02:00:58,992
Wherever you say!

2169
02:00:59,786 --> 02:01:01,232
What are you saying,
mother-in-law?

2170
02:01:01,672 --> 02:01:03,752
Why would I steal?

2171
02:01:04,678 --> 02:01:06,592
Does anyone commit robbery
in their own house?

2172
02:01:06,912 --> 02:01:08,752
Please explain her.

2173
02:01:09,549 --> 02:01:11,335
Yes mother, how that is possible.

2174
02:01:11,752 --> 02:01:12,992
Shalu can never do such a thing.

2175
02:01:13,312 --> 02:01:15,058
I know her very well.

2176
02:01:15,622 --> 02:01:17,771
Why are you talking childishly,
Suraj?

2177
02:01:18,309 --> 02:01:19,367
It doesn't take time for
the milk to get spoiled.

2178
02:01:19,447 --> 02:01:21,072
And the intentions to change!

2179
02:01:21,915 --> 02:01:26,314
This girl had seen
what's in my safe!

2180
02:01:26,552 --> 02:01:28,416
And I am completely sure.

2181
02:01:28,558 --> 02:01:30,072
She has committed the theft.

2182
02:01:30,571 --> 02:01:33,709
And that's why she has come in
this house from the village.

2183
02:01:34,059 --> 02:01:35,472
You can say whatever you
want, mother-in-law.

2184
02:01:35,963 --> 02:01:38,205
But don't accuse me of theft.

2185
02:01:38,392 --> 02:01:41,498
May I die, if I have even
touched your safe!

2186
02:01:41,919 --> 02:01:42,832
Mummy, I saying it again.

2187
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:43,992
She cannot do such a thing.

2188
02:01:44,312 --> 02:01:46,152
She doesn't have any
greed for anything.

2189
02:01:47,113 --> 02:01:48,759
And still if you are not satisfied..

2190
02:01:48,839 --> 02:01:50,392
..then you can search our room!

2191
02:01:50,672 --> 02:01:52,152
Secretary! Search the place.

2192
02:01:52,536 --> 02:01:53,872
Sevak, search the place!

2193
02:01:58,257 --> 02:01:59,752
Below the watch!

2194
02:02:04,306 --> 02:02:05,392
Behind the statue!

2195
02:02:15,071 --> 02:02:16,912
Below the bed!

2196
02:02:40,410 --> 02:02:41,232
Now tell me!

2197
02:02:41,777 --> 02:02:42,672
Answer me!

2198
02:02:43,161 --> 02:02:44,872
How was this jewellery
found in this room?

2199
02:02:45,669 --> 02:02:48,552
And that too, it was found
in your cupboard.

2200
02:02:49,132 --> 02:02:49,912
No!

2201
02:02:50,070 --> 02:02:53,232
You said, may I die if I
have touched your safe.

2202
02:02:53,703 --> 02:02:55,672
Then, have I kept this
in your cupboard.

2203
02:02:56,069 --> 02:02:58,435
Mother-in-law, I don't know.

2204
02:02:58,825 --> 02:03:01,124
How this came here?

2205
02:03:01,872 --> 02:03:05,192
Dear, you know your
Shalu is not a thief.

2206
02:03:05,382 --> 02:03:06,232
Say something.

2207
02:03:06,450 --> 02:03:07,752
What will he say?

2208
02:03:08,445 --> 02:03:09,472
Secretary!
- Madam.

2209
02:03:09,552 --> 02:03:10,833
Call the police.
- Yes madam.

2210
02:03:10,962 --> 02:03:12,992
Mummy, there is no need
to call the police.

2211
02:03:13,648 --> 02:03:14,632
It will create a scene.

2212
02:03:15,070 --> 02:03:15,872
Fine.

2213
02:03:16,372 --> 02:03:19,249
Ask her to leave this
house right now.

2214
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:21,518
Sevakram, bring this to my room.

2215
02:03:21,970 --> 02:03:23,392
Secretary. Follow me!

2216
02:03:23,472 --> 02:03:24,552
Yes madam!

2217
02:03:39,182 --> 02:03:42,952
Dear, are you very upset?

2218
02:03:49,765 --> 02:03:53,232
Look, you are dearest to me!

2219
02:03:53,803 --> 02:03:58,232
I swear on you.. I am innocent.

2220
02:03:59,018 --> 02:03:59,912
Yes.

2221
02:04:00,396 --> 02:04:01,872
That's what you say, Shalu.

2222
02:04:03,914 --> 02:04:05,392
But what difference does that make.

2223
02:04:06,807 --> 02:04:10,512
In this house, until my mother
doesn't consider your innocent.

2224
02:04:10,826 --> 02:04:12,992
Neither can I say anything
nor do anything.

2225
02:04:13,712 --> 02:04:17,112
That means.. that means you
feel the same thing.

2226
02:04:17,912 --> 02:04:19,392
That your Shalu is a thief!

2227
02:04:20,239 --> 02:04:23,672
I don't point fingers at anyone
Shalu, I really don't.

2228
02:04:24,728 --> 02:04:26,232
For Gods sake, leave me
alone Shalu, please.

2229
02:04:26,753 --> 02:04:27,832
Mother-in-law.

2230
02:04:30,734 --> 02:04:31,552
You!

2231
02:04:32,995 --> 02:04:35,312
You still haven't left this house!

2232
02:04:36,756 --> 02:04:38,665
What harm have I done
to you, mother-in-law?

2233
02:04:39,166 --> 02:04:43,203
The Lord knows, I didn't
marry your son.

2234
02:04:43,336 --> 02:04:44,998
It was him who made me his wife.

2235
02:04:45,166 --> 02:04:45,992
Not at all!

2236
02:04:46,166 --> 02:04:49,072
A thief can never be our
family's daughter-in-law!

2237
02:04:49,999 --> 02:04:51,472
Don't call me a thief mother-in-law.

2238
02:04:52,064 --> 02:04:53,929
I haven't stolen anything from you.

2239
02:04:54,194 --> 02:04:55,820
You know that very well.

2240
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:58,992
Why are you ruining my
happily married life?

2241
02:04:59,166 --> 02:05:00,152
Your married life!

2242
02:05:01,155 --> 02:05:04,552
Dreaming about something
more than your status..

2243
02:05:05,091 --> 02:05:07,832
..causes humans downfall.
- No!

2244
02:05:07,912 --> 02:05:09,752
But you didn't think about that!

2245
02:05:10,533 --> 02:05:13,104
That's why, you will
be punished for it.

2246
02:05:13,405 --> 02:05:15,352
There is no place for you
neither in our hearts..

2247
02:05:15,514 --> 02:05:17,832
..nor in our house! Get out of here!

2248
02:05:17,912 --> 02:05:21,124
No! This house is venerable
for me, mother-in-law.

2249
02:05:21,204 --> 02:05:22,152
Get lost.

2250
02:05:22,232 --> 02:05:23,872
Don't call me by that name.

2251
02:05:24,232 --> 02:05:26,105
We don't have any relation!

2252
02:05:26,185 --> 02:05:27,072
Get up.
- No.

2253
02:05:27,152 --> 02:05:29,218
Get out of here!
- I say, get out!

2254
02:05:40,227 --> 02:05:41,072
Thank God!

2255
02:05:42,691 --> 02:05:44,912
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law!

2256
02:05:45,433 --> 02:05:46,152
Where are you sister-in-law?

2257
02:05:46,372 --> 02:05:47,836
Look, what I have brought for you?

2258
02:05:48,071 --> 02:05:49,046
Vicky.
- Sister-in-law!

2259
02:05:50,043 --> 02:05:50,752
Aarti, where is sister-in-law?

2260
02:05:50,832 --> 02:05:52,458
Aunt threw sister-in-law
out of the house.

2261
02:05:52,538 --> 02:05:53,885
What! Threw her out of the house!

2262
02:05:54,067 --> 02:05:54,832
But why?

2263
02:05:55,047 --> 02:05:56,912
Aunt accused her of thieving.

2264
02:05:57,116 --> 02:05:59,478
And the stolen goods were found
from sister-in-law's cupboard.

2265
02:05:59,616 --> 02:06:00,392
No, that's a lie.

2266
02:06:00,472 --> 02:06:01,672
Sister-in-law can never
do such a thing.

2267
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:04,912
This is surely someone's conspiracy.

2268
02:06:07,845 --> 02:06:11,351
'Sevak, what are you doing
in brothers room so late.'

2269
02:06:11,431 --> 02:06:12,392
'In brother's room.'

2270
02:06:12,663 --> 02:06:13,552
'I had gone to keep sweet porridge
in brother's room.'

2271
02:06:13,763 --> 02:06:15,872
'Sweet porridge!
- No.'

2272
02:06:17,239 --> 02:06:19,152
'But brother doesn't
eat sweet porridge.'

2273
02:06:19,417 --> 02:06:21,232
'I had gone to keep
in brother's house.'

2274
02:06:22,652 --> 02:06:23,472
'Milk!'

2275
02:06:24,176 --> 02:06:25,385
'Fine go.'

2276
02:06:27,743 --> 02:06:28,392
Vicky!

2277
02:06:28,877 --> 02:06:29,792
Vicky!

2278
02:06:30,007 --> 02:06:30,952
What are you thinking about?

2279
02:06:31,032 --> 02:06:32,232
Nothing, I will just come.

2280
02:06:33,184 --> 02:06:35,251
My name is Chameli..
- Sevak.

2281
02:06:35,331 --> 02:06:39,199
Yes Vicky sir, do you want tea,
coffee, Bournvita or Horlicks.

2282
02:06:39,279 --> 02:06:40,312
I don't want anything.

2283
02:06:40,683 --> 02:06:42,712
Tell me, what were you doing
last night in brother..

2284
02:06:42,792 --> 02:06:43,872
..and sister-in-law's room?

2285
02:06:45,722 --> 02:06:46,552
What was I doing?

2286
02:06:46,716 --> 02:06:49,712
I had told you, I had gone
there to lay the bed.

2287
02:06:49,888 --> 02:06:51,552
Lay the bed!
- Yes, to lay the bed.

2288
02:06:53,176 --> 02:06:54,872
But you had something
else at that time.

2289
02:06:55,078 --> 02:06:56,032
Said something else.

2290
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:57,832
What had I said!

2291
02:06:58,299 --> 02:07:00,656
I remembered.

2292
02:07:01,547 --> 02:07:02,592
I had gone to keep the milk.

2293
02:07:02,672 --> 02:07:04,032
To keep the milk.
- Yes, to keep the milk.

2294
02:07:04,112 --> 02:07:05,472
You scoundrel!

2295
02:07:08,026 --> 02:07:09,832
Deceiver, sometimes
its sweet porridge..

2296
02:07:10,091 --> 02:07:10,992
..sometimes you say
to lay the bed.

2297
02:07:11,230 --> 02:07:12,352
And sometimes you say
to keep the milk.

2298
02:07:12,843 --> 02:07:15,068
Tell me the truth, or
else I will stab you.

2299
02:07:15,192 --> 02:07:17,192
I will tell the truth,
don't hit me.

2300
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:19,712
Will you tell the truth?
- Yes, I will!

2301
02:07:19,792 --> 02:07:20,752
Come on.

2302
02:07:22,092 --> 02:07:22,584
Say it!

2303
02:07:22,664 --> 02:07:23,752
Tell everyone!
- Tell everyone what the truth is!

2304
02:07:23,832 --> 02:07:25,352
Or else I will thrash you!

2305
02:07:25,432 --> 02:07:26,752
What happened?

2306
02:07:26,832 --> 02:07:29,951
He will tell you that, tell them!
- I will tell them.

2307
02:07:30,523 --> 02:07:31,432
I will tell them!

2308
02:07:32,118 --> 02:07:33,912
Daughter-in-law is innocent!

2309
02:07:34,298 --> 02:07:35,992
She did not commit the theft!

2310
02:07:37,990 --> 02:07:41,418
Madam had asked me to
keep the jewellery..

2311
02:07:42,039 --> 02:07:43,820
..in daughter-in-law's cupboard.

2312
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:45,645
When she isn't in the room!

2313
02:07:47,734 --> 02:07:49,807
Your scoundrel, I will kill you!

2314
02:07:50,165 --> 02:07:52,208
I will kill you! I will kill you!

2315
02:07:52,797 --> 02:07:53,914
Leave him!

2316
02:07:54,113 --> 02:07:55,112
What's the use beating him up!

2317
02:07:55,629 --> 02:07:56,832
The real culprit is your mother.

2318
02:07:57,774 --> 02:07:58,432
Leave him!

2319
02:07:59,285 --> 02:08:00,481
Get out of this house right now.

2320
02:08:00,605 --> 02:08:02,289
And if you ever come
in this house again..

2321
02:08:02,369 --> 02:08:03,592
..then I will kill you, understood.

2322
02:08:03,733 --> 02:08:05,592
Get out! Get out! Get out!

2323
02:08:06,096 --> 02:08:07,352
The scoundrel! Liar!

2324
02:08:07,694 --> 02:08:09,112
Brother, let mummy come.

2325
02:08:09,475 --> 02:08:12,782
If I don't make her admit her
crime, then my name isn't Vicky!

2326
02:08:13,443 --> 02:08:15,907
No Vicky, don't say anything
to anyone right now.

2327
02:08:16,438 --> 02:08:18,295
First we have to find
out where Shalu is.

2328
02:08:18,792 --> 02:08:21,512
God knows where and in what
condition the poor thing will be.

2329
02:08:21,849 --> 02:08:22,672
Look son.

2330
02:08:23,865 --> 02:08:25,752
In our country, girls that are
thrown out of their in-law's house..

2331
02:08:25,832 --> 02:08:26,912
..have only two choices.

2332
02:08:27,907 --> 02:08:29,752
Either she commits suicide.

2333
02:08:30,128 --> 02:08:31,432
Or she returns to her in-laws house.

2334
02:08:39,514 --> 02:08:44,992
"Lord, show the right path to
the ones that have strayed."

2335
02:08:45,072 --> 02:08:50,912
"Lord, show the right path to
the ones that have strayed."

2336
02:08:51,297 --> 02:08:59,112
"Let love blossom in every house."

2337
02:09:00,230 --> 02:09:03,432
"You help everyone."

2338
02:09:03,512 --> 02:09:06,594
"You help everyone."

2339
02:09:06,745 --> 02:09:12,352
"Without being asked
or any expectations."

2340
02:09:12,953 --> 02:09:18,272
"You solve all our problems."

2341
02:09:18,672 --> 02:09:22,752
"You name is true."

2342
02:09:25,726 --> 02:09:26,512
Shalu!

2343
02:09:37,429 --> 02:09:41,552
Have you come alone?

2344
02:09:42,427 --> 02:09:46,232
Or have you brought the police
along to arrest me?

2345
02:09:48,104 --> 02:09:52,353
I have brought the bond
of love to bind you..

2346
02:09:52,433 --> 02:09:57,552
..which shattered somehow
without my knowledge.

2347
02:09:59,790 --> 02:10:02,427
I always knew that
you were innocent.

2348
02:10:03,872 --> 02:10:11,211
But the situation was such that,
I couldn't say anything.

2349
02:10:14,153 --> 02:10:16,072
And now I have come to apologise
to you, Shalu.

2350
02:10:17,393 --> 02:10:19,672
Everyone knows that it was
my mother's conspiracy.

2351
02:10:21,715 --> 02:10:23,752
I apologise on behalf
of my mummy too, Shalu.

2352
02:10:25,684 --> 02:10:28,551
I don't have any complaints
with anyone, dear.

2353
02:10:30,912 --> 02:10:35,872
I will surely get
what's in my fate.

2354
02:10:36,650 --> 02:10:38,232
But now I have taken
a decision, Shalu.

2355
02:10:39,490 --> 02:10:41,872
I have decided that we will
not go back to that house.

2356
02:10:42,831 --> 02:10:44,672
We'll go somewhere else, we
will live somewhere else.

2357
02:10:44,990 --> 02:10:47,250
We will live in a rented house.

2358
02:10:48,567 --> 02:10:49,912
Only we both will be there.

2359
02:10:50,787 --> 02:10:52,312
Where there will be only love!

2360
02:10:53,212 --> 02:10:55,152
And there will be no one to
commit atrocity on you.

2361
02:10:56,641 --> 02:10:58,073
What are you saying, dear?

2362
02:10:58,809 --> 02:11:04,072
I am not the type of girl that
separates a son from his parents!

2363
02:11:05,517 --> 02:11:08,312
I will return with
you to that house.

2364
02:11:10,322 --> 02:11:11,312
But on one condition.

2365
02:11:12,011 --> 02:11:13,312
Yes, tell me.

2366
02:11:13,969 --> 02:11:15,072
Promise me one thing.

2367
02:11:15,897 --> 02:11:21,525
You won't defame mother-in-law
for what you found out.

2368
02:11:28,332 --> 02:11:29,592
What are you thinking, beloved?

2369
02:11:31,592 --> 02:11:33,143
I can't understand Shalu.

2370
02:11:34,056 --> 02:11:35,232
What are you made up of?

2371
02:11:36,404 --> 02:11:37,992
Even after going through so much..

2372
02:11:39,239 --> 02:11:40,992
..still you don't have any grievance
against my mother.

2373
02:11:41,723 --> 02:11:43,232
You don't have any complaints
against her.

2374
02:11:43,412 --> 02:11:46,430
Dear, she isn't just your mother.

2375
02:11:46,842 --> 02:11:48,250
She is my mother-in-law too.

2376
02:11:48,672 --> 02:11:50,832
And mother-in-law is
just like a mother.

2377
02:11:51,286 --> 02:11:52,232
Isn't she?

2378
02:11:53,552 --> 02:11:54,312
Yes.

2379
02:11:55,621 --> 02:11:56,472
Then promise me.

2380
02:11:59,144 --> 02:11:59,942
Shut up!

2381
02:12:00,638 --> 02:12:04,232
Except for me, no one ever
took decision, no one can..

2382
02:12:04,312 --> 02:12:06,232
..and no one ever will!
Understood!

2383
02:12:07,390 --> 02:12:09,651
Day after tomorrow is
my wedding anniversary.

2384
02:12:10,098 --> 02:12:12,232
On the same day, I will announce
your engagement..

2385
02:12:12,312 --> 02:12:14,445
..with the daughter
of Bhanupratap.

2386
02:12:14,525 --> 02:12:15,472
Not at all, mummy.

2387
02:12:16,293 --> 02:12:18,771
I can leave your house,
but not Aarti.

2388
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:22,104
I will marry only Aarti.
- What?

2389
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:25,472
Can I dare to say something?

2390
02:12:26,069 --> 02:12:29,374
I think these days you should
agree to the children's advice.

2391
02:12:29,454 --> 02:12:30,472
This is my advice, the rest..

2392
02:12:30,552 --> 02:12:31,672
You keep quiet!

2393
02:12:32,113 --> 02:12:34,103
You have spoilt them!

2394
02:12:34,183 --> 02:12:35,232
No..
- Mummy!

2395
02:12:46,965 --> 02:12:47,872
Sister-in-law!

2396
02:12:49,221 --> 02:12:50,440
Where had you gone,
sister-in-law?

2397
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:51,552
It was my mistake,
brother-in-law..

2398
02:12:51,739 --> 02:12:52,752
Move!

2399
02:12:53,635 --> 02:12:56,164
You have brought your beloved back!

2400
02:12:56,620 --> 02:12:59,472
You know she is a thief and not
worthy of living in this house.

2401
02:12:59,617 --> 02:13:02,228
Mummy, anyone can make a mistake!

2402
02:13:04,327 --> 02:13:06,530
Anyways, I have explained Shalu.

2403
02:13:06,610 --> 02:13:09,592
She will try not to give you
any reason to complain.

2404
02:13:09,919 --> 02:13:10,659
Yes mother-in-law.

2405
02:13:10,739 --> 02:13:12,152
There is no question of that at all.

2406
02:13:12,597 --> 02:13:16,632
Once I lose respect for
a banished woman..

2407
02:13:16,945 --> 02:13:20,011
..then I can't respect her again.

2408
02:13:20,472 --> 02:13:23,005
She doesn't want your respect..

2409
02:13:23,085 --> 02:13:24,592
..she just wants your blessings.

2410
02:13:24,743 --> 02:13:27,152
And I won't even curse her.

2411
02:13:27,232 --> 02:13:28,152
She is a thief!

2412
02:13:28,336 --> 02:13:29,992
Mummy!
- Brother-in-law!

2413
02:13:31,315 --> 02:13:32,592
I don't like mummy's behaviour.

2414
02:13:32,672 --> 02:13:34,552
Vicky, don't say anything right now.

2415
02:13:34,917 --> 02:13:35,832
Just calm down.

2416
02:13:36,831 --> 02:13:37,872
Come Shalu.

2417
02:13:39,495 --> 02:13:45,232
80! 85! 95! 100!

2418
02:13:45,312 --> 02:13:48,450
Secretary!
Why are you counting wrongly, idiot?

2419
02:13:48,649 --> 02:13:50,072
Count again!
- Again!

2420
02:13:50,617 --> 02:13:52,392
O God.

2421
02:13:52,838 --> 02:13:54,072
I swear on your father.

2422
02:13:54,228 --> 02:13:56,472
I swear on your great grandfather,
I will never listen to you..

2423
02:13:56,552 --> 02:13:58,072
Why are you speaking in Punjabi,
idiot!

2424
02:13:58,212 --> 02:14:00,834
I am speaking in Punjabi,
so that you get strength.

2425
02:14:00,914 --> 02:14:02,232
The food of Punjab is good.

2426
02:14:02,367 --> 02:14:04,577
Corn flour roti
and mustard spinach.

2427
02:14:04,657 --> 02:14:06,900
That song "Color me up.."

2428
02:14:07,187 --> 02:14:09,232
Shut up! Shut up you fool!

2429
02:14:09,312 --> 02:14:11,832
Forgive me my madam!

2430
02:14:12,079 --> 02:14:13,912
I will never forgive you.

2431
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:17,532
You have taken so much
money from me..

2432
02:14:17,612 --> 02:14:20,316
..and all of your
ideas have flopped.

2433
02:14:20,396 --> 02:14:22,472
And that illiterate, uneducated,
ignorant girl..

2434
02:14:22,651 --> 02:14:25,432
..has come back in this house
to make my life hell.

2435
02:14:25,512 --> 02:14:26,240
I am sorry madam.

2436
02:14:26,431 --> 02:14:28,232
If you can forgive my last mistake.

2437
02:14:28,579 --> 02:14:31,752
Then I can present the
last idea of my life.

2438
02:14:32,129 --> 02:14:33,592
And I won't charge you
anything for it.

2439
02:14:33,672 --> 02:14:34,712
Free of charge.

2440
02:14:35,004 --> 02:14:35,912
What is it, tell me.

2441
02:14:36,289 --> 02:14:37,392
Come on get up!

2442
02:14:39,011 --> 02:14:42,423
You must have heard of the
great emperor Akbar.

2443
02:14:42,556 --> 02:14:46,232
One of my forefathers,
had give this idea..

2444
02:14:46,312 --> 02:14:47,905
..to the emperor Akbar.

2445
02:14:47,985 --> 02:14:52,331
Because of which, Anarkali
forever went away..

2446
02:14:52,411 --> 02:14:54,072
..from Salim's life.

2447
02:14:54,152 --> 02:14:56,472
You fool, what is the idea tell me.

2448
02:14:57,175 --> 02:15:00,357
It is not just an idea madam,
it is an atom bomb.

2449
02:15:00,437 --> 02:15:01,592
It can never fail.

2450
02:15:01,672 --> 02:15:05,967
If Suraj's Anarkali isn't
thrown out of this house..

2451
02:15:06,207 --> 02:15:07,632
..then your name isn't Mrs.
Kamla Bhandari.

2452
02:15:07,712 --> 02:15:08,245
What?

2453
02:15:08,325 --> 02:15:11,098
No, no, I mean my name isn't
secretary P.K Patiyalewala.

2454
02:15:11,178 --> 02:15:12,592
Tell me, what is it?

2455
02:15:12,764 --> 02:15:14,272
Move your specs and listen.

2456
02:15:15,069 --> 02:15:16,422
Specs! Why?

2457
02:15:20,682 --> 02:15:21,672
Good evening!

2458
02:15:22,486 --> 02:15:24,737
Happy wedding anniversary,
Mrs. Kamla Bhandari.

2459
02:15:24,875 --> 02:15:25,752
Come.

2460
02:15:27,090 --> 02:15:28,575
Greetings.
- Come, come.

2461
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:30,201
Congratulations.

2462
02:15:30,281 --> 02:15:31,232
Mehra.
- Yes.

2463
02:15:32,054 --> 02:15:34,232
For the last 10 years, Kamla
has been celebrating..

2464
02:15:34,312 --> 02:15:36,295
..her 25th marriage anniversary.

2465
02:15:37,066 --> 02:15:40,952
But no matter what, my
sister-in-law still looks gorgeous.

2466
02:15:41,524 --> 02:15:43,192
Then what do I look like to you?

2467
02:15:45,278 --> 02:15:47,716
No, no you look like
a dazzling star too.

2468
02:15:47,933 --> 02:15:49,272
Happy now.
- Yes.

2469
02:16:02,089 --> 02:16:03,032
Excuse me!

2470
02:16:03,335 --> 02:16:05,192
I can't see your daughter-in-law
anywhere Mrs. Bhandari.

2471
02:16:05,272 --> 02:16:06,025
Where is she?

2472
02:16:06,105 --> 02:16:09,032
She is upstairs. She
is getting ready.

2473
02:16:09,112 --> 02:16:10,192
You please carry on.

2474
02:16:26,022 --> 02:16:30,712
"Mother-in-law, you.."

2475
02:16:31,569 --> 02:16:34,563
"You.."

2476
02:16:35,428 --> 02:16:40,592
"Mother-in-law, you didn't
know my value!"

2477
02:16:40,712 --> 02:16:45,712
"Mother-in-law, you didn't
know my value!"

2478
02:16:46,411 --> 02:16:51,412
"You never considered me
as a daughter-in-law."

2479
02:16:51,492 --> 02:16:55,952
"You never considered me
as a daughter-in-law."

2480
02:16:56,032 --> 02:16:59,329
"Always considered
me as a servant."

2481
02:16:59,621 --> 02:17:04,617
"Mother-in-law, you didn't
know my value!"

2482
02:17:04,697 --> 02:17:09,632
"Mother-in-law, you didn't
know my value!"

2483
02:17:09,712 --> 02:17:14,832
"Mother-in-law,
you didn't know my value!"

2484
02:17:32,872 --> 02:17:38,192
"Mother-in-law,
you didn't know my value!"

2485
02:17:38,272 --> 02:17:41,173
"Since I entered your home."

2486
02:17:47,159 --> 02:17:49,832
"I could never stay in
peace a single day."

2487
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:54,672
"Since I entered your home."

2488
02:17:54,752 --> 02:17:57,272
"I could never stay in
peace a single day."

2489
02:17:59,759 --> 02:18:04,512
"You never listened to me,
always did as you pleased."

2490
02:18:04,592 --> 02:18:07,272
"Mother-in-law, you.."

2491
02:18:09,646 --> 02:18:14,592
"Mother-in-law, you didn't
know my value!"

2492
02:18:14,712 --> 02:18:19,712
"Mother-in-law, you didn't
know my value!"

2493
02:18:44,979 --> 02:18:49,988
"Mother-in-law, you didn't
know my value!"

2494
02:18:50,068 --> 02:18:51,712
"Abused me."

2495
02:18:52,632 --> 02:18:54,272
"Whipped me."

2496
02:18:55,192 --> 02:18:56,352
"Abused me."

2497
02:18:56,432 --> 02:18:57,952
"Whipped me."

2498
02:18:58,555 --> 02:19:02,832
"Accused me of theft."

2499
02:19:03,537 --> 02:19:07,632
"Accused me of theft."

2500
02:19:08,012 --> 02:19:12,632
"Today I will tell everyone
about your atrocity."

2501
02:19:12,712 --> 02:19:15,432
"Mother-in-law, you.."

2502
02:19:17,794 --> 02:19:22,592
"Mother-in-law, you didn't
know my value!"

2503
02:19:22,765 --> 02:19:27,872
"Mother-in-law, you didn't
know my value!"

2504
02:19:52,854 --> 02:19:57,952
"Mother-in-law, you didn't
know my value!"

2505
02:19:58,195 --> 02:20:01,033
"I turned this house into heaven."

2506
02:20:03,305 --> 02:20:06,245
"Served you, tolerated
your attitude."

2507
02:20:08,273 --> 02:20:10,872
"I turned this house into heaven."

2508
02:20:10,952 --> 02:20:13,712
"Served you, tolerated
your attitude."

2509
02:20:15,872 --> 02:20:20,432
"I won over everyone with my love,
but you still remained a stranger."

2510
02:20:20,512 --> 02:20:23,632
"Mother-in-law, you.."

2511
02:20:25,651 --> 02:20:30,632
"Mother-in-law, you didn't
know my value!"

2512
02:20:31,176 --> 02:20:35,832
"You never considered me
as a daughter-in-law."

2513
02:20:36,272 --> 02:20:40,552
"You never considered me
as a daughter-in-law."

2514
02:20:40,632 --> 02:20:44,011
"Always considered me
as a servant."

2515
02:20:44,091 --> 02:20:48,952
"Mother-in-law, you didn't
know my value!"

2516
02:20:49,032 --> 02:20:50,899
"Mother-in-law.."
- Shalu!

2517
02:20:56,687 --> 02:20:57,832
What is this misbehaviour?

2518
02:20:58,512 --> 02:20:59,512
You are drunk?

2519
02:21:00,199 --> 02:21:02,352
Don't you care about the respect
of my family and me!

2520
02:21:02,997 --> 02:21:04,512
To whom are you saying that, son?

2521
02:21:05,008 --> 02:21:08,272
What will this shameless know
about honour of the family.

2522
02:21:08,872 --> 02:21:11,832
She is a stigma for this house
and not the daughter-in-law!

2523
02:21:12,432 --> 02:21:14,677
I am telling you son,
come to your senses.

2524
02:21:14,872 --> 02:21:16,512
And get rid of her.

2525
02:21:17,091 --> 02:21:19,832
This ignorant girl is not from
a respectable bloodline.

2526
02:21:20,399 --> 02:21:21,832
Mind your language!

2527
02:21:22,396 --> 02:21:25,032
You have no right what so
ever to abuse my father!

2528
02:21:27,963 --> 02:21:30,512
You committed atrocity
on me, I tolerated it.

2529
02:21:31,062 --> 02:21:32,512
Whatever you said to me,
I listened calmly.

2530
02:21:33,112 --> 02:21:36,352
But I cannot hear a single
world against my father!

2531
02:21:37,421 --> 02:21:40,032
What do you think, I am
ignorant, illiterate.

2532
02:21:40,341 --> 02:21:41,272
Uneducated!

2533
02:21:41,632 --> 02:21:42,752
For your kind information..

2534
02:21:42,832 --> 02:21:44,712
..I am much better educated
than you are!

2535
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:46,712
I am an Oxford graduate.

2536
02:21:48,341 --> 02:21:52,152
Shalu.. - There is no need
to be shocked Suraj.

2537
02:21:52,734 --> 02:21:55,192
I have evidence of my truth.

2538
02:21:56,933 --> 02:22:00,632
Then.. till today whatever
happened, was that an act?

2539
02:22:00,935 --> 02:22:03,712
Yes, all this was an act.

2540
02:22:04,278 --> 02:22:05,632
And I ended it today.

2541
02:22:06,337 --> 02:22:07,952
Because there is a
limit to tolerance!

2542
02:22:09,924 --> 02:22:13,872
My mother-in-law tried every means
to throw me out of this house.

2543
02:22:14,422 --> 02:22:16,112
She had also made the
plan to get me drunk..

2544
02:22:16,384 --> 02:22:18,952
..and have me insulted
in front of everyone.

2545
02:22:19,330 --> 02:22:21,192
So that you develop
hatred towards me.

2546
02:22:21,650 --> 02:22:24,192
And you throw me out of
this house and your life.

2547
02:22:27,184 --> 02:22:30,112
But mother-in-law, I didn't
drink alcohol today.

2548
02:22:30,996 --> 02:22:34,472
I just swallowed my pride,
and created this scene..

2549
02:22:34,972 --> 02:22:37,272
..so that I get rid
of your ignorance!

2550
02:22:37,947 --> 02:22:41,272
You are very proud of your
wealth and your family.

2551
02:22:41,778 --> 02:22:43,752
I am not from a lowly family too.

2552
02:22:44,843 --> 02:22:48,192
Like you, I am the daughter
of a well-known rich person.

2553
02:22:49,313 --> 02:22:50,992
Do you know who my daddy is?

2554
02:22:53,041 --> 02:22:54,472
Mr. Ashok Mehra!

2555
02:22:58,305 --> 02:23:02,872
Mehra brother, you.. all this..

2556
02:23:03,691 --> 02:23:04,912
Is Shalu your daughter?

2557
02:23:05,829 --> 02:23:07,112
Yes, Mrs. Bhandari.

2558
02:23:08,467 --> 02:23:11,392
I am very proud of my daughter.

2559
02:23:12,535 --> 02:23:15,512
Actually you had seen her
when she was very small.

2560
02:23:16,121 --> 02:23:17,912
Then she went to London
for education.

2561
02:23:18,087 --> 02:23:21,232
But.. but why didn't Shalu
tell us that before?

2562
02:23:21,413 --> 02:23:23,632
Because it was your husband's order.

2563
02:23:26,938 --> 02:23:30,032
This act was put up on his will.

2564
02:23:31,370 --> 02:23:32,952
Daddy and uncle Bhandari wanted me..

2565
02:23:33,548 --> 02:23:36,672
..to come in this house
as Suraj's wife.

2566
02:23:37,613 --> 02:23:39,663
When he kept this problem
in front of me.

2567
02:23:40,013 --> 02:23:42,152
I accepted it as a challenge.

2568
02:23:43,227 --> 02:23:45,912
And I came in this house
by marrying Suraj.

2569
02:23:47,477 --> 02:23:49,536
I tried every way,
mother-in-law.

2570
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:52,552
But I couldn't make a place for
myself in your heart, mother-in-law.

2571
02:23:53,631 --> 02:23:57,846
God knows, I have a lot
of respect for you.

2572
02:23:58,661 --> 02:24:00,857
Because you are the
mother of my husband.

2573
02:24:01,783 --> 02:24:05,512
I.. lost my mother
in my childhood.

2574
02:24:06,622 --> 02:24:10,293
I thought I will get a
mother's love from you.

2575
02:24:11,284 --> 02:24:13,832
But, I was not destined
for mother's love.

2576
02:24:15,009 --> 02:24:17,072
You didn't even consider me
as your daughter-in-law.

2577
02:24:18,312 --> 02:24:22,152
But today, I want to ask
everyone a question!

2578
02:24:22,941 --> 02:24:25,312
Why is a daughter-in-law
always destined..

2579
02:24:25,392 --> 02:24:26,552
..for her mother-in-law's abuses.

2580
02:24:27,263 --> 02:24:30,312
Is that why she leaves
her parents house..

2581
02:24:30,392 --> 02:24:31,992
..and accepts a strangers family.

2582
02:24:32,394 --> 02:24:34,832
Doesn't she have the right
to any happiness?

2583
02:24:40,806 --> 02:24:41,472
Mother-in-law.

2584
02:24:43,573 --> 02:24:48,712
You can keep your wealth,
your honour and your pride.

2585
02:24:50,589 --> 02:24:51,872
I am leaving.

2586
02:24:53,149 --> 02:24:54,312
Shalu! No!

2587
02:24:54,774 --> 02:24:56,952
As soon as you leave, this house
will turn back into hell.

2588
02:24:57,866 --> 02:25:00,992
And if you still want to leave,
then I will come along too.

2589
02:25:01,072 --> 02:25:05,748
No Suraj, you will find
a wife like me.

2590
02:25:06,511 --> 02:25:07,968
But you won't find a mother.

2591
02:25:08,427 --> 02:25:11,868
No matter how the mother is,
she is respectable.

2592
02:25:12,488 --> 02:25:15,152
Don't leave her for me.

2593
02:25:18,361 --> 02:25:21,123
Shalu.
- Let me go, Suraj.

2594
02:25:21,489 --> 02:25:25,355
If I have committed any mistake,
the please forgive me.

2595
02:25:27,320 --> 02:25:28,152
Come on daddy.

2596
02:25:29,646 --> 02:25:30,472
Wait daughter-in-law.

2597
02:25:31,465 --> 02:25:33,472
Even I want to say
something today.

2598
02:25:34,779 --> 02:25:35,992
For years I kept quiet.

2599
02:25:37,172 --> 02:25:39,312
Even though I knew what is
wrong and what is right.

2600
02:25:39,954 --> 02:25:41,832
I just kept watching
everything silently.

2601
02:25:42,777 --> 02:25:45,992
But today, I have found
my voice again.

2602
02:25:47,371 --> 02:25:49,872
And for the first time
I announce that..

2603
02:25:50,574 --> 02:25:54,953
..neither me or any of my son
will stay in this house.

2604
02:25:57,922 --> 02:25:59,494
What are you saying father-in-law?

2605
02:26:00,269 --> 02:26:01,787
This house belongs to you.

2606
02:26:01,867 --> 02:26:04,832
Dear, firstly this isn't a house.

2607
02:26:05,333 --> 02:26:06,378
It is a prison.

2608
02:26:06,751 --> 02:26:10,392
And this arrogant woman is the
owner of the grand prison.

2609
02:26:11,110 --> 02:26:15,312
And she rules with her stiff
neck, puffed nostrils..

2610
02:26:15,392 --> 02:26:17,152
..and a bitter mouth.

2611
02:26:19,703 --> 02:26:22,472
She gave birth to her sons.

2612
02:26:23,141 --> 02:26:26,152
But she took care of them
like a post dated cheque.

2613
02:26:26,808 --> 02:26:28,312
So that when they are
of marriageable age.

2614
02:26:28,726 --> 02:26:29,992
She can use them.

2615
02:26:31,058 --> 02:26:33,950
She doesn't know.
What sons are?

2616
02:26:34,566 --> 02:26:36,232
What duties a mother
has towards her sons.

2617
02:26:37,002 --> 02:26:38,072
When she doesn't know that!

2618
02:26:38,455 --> 02:26:40,232
How will she know what
is a daughter-in-law!

2619
02:26:40,312 --> 02:26:41,832
What a mother-in-law's duties
are towards her daughter-in-law?

2620
02:26:43,857 --> 02:26:45,152
I had created this scene.

2621
02:26:46,236 --> 02:26:48,632
With the help of my friend.

2622
02:26:49,916 --> 02:26:52,312
So that I can bring my
wife on the right path.

2623
02:26:53,223 --> 02:26:54,232
But I was unsuccessful.

2624
02:26:55,015 --> 02:26:56,682
She didn't come on the right path.

2625
02:26:57,637 --> 02:27:02,771
But I made Shalu's life hell by
bringing her in this house.

2626
02:27:03,691 --> 02:27:04,750
Shalu..

2627
02:27:05,795 --> 02:27:12,007
Just like for Sita, Ayodhya
was wherever Ram dwelled.

2628
02:27:12,623 --> 02:27:15,779
Just like that, our house
will be wherever you live.

2629
02:27:16,741 --> 02:27:18,352
That's heaven for us.

2630
02:27:18,713 --> 02:27:21,432
And after today, this
arrogant woman..

2631
02:27:22,042 --> 02:27:25,192
..will stay in her grand prison
like a wandering soul!

2632
02:27:25,652 --> 02:27:29,574
And will rule her safe, her
jewellery and her furniture.

2633
02:27:29,989 --> 02:27:32,192
And the day she dies,
there won't be anyone..

2634
02:27:32,272 --> 02:27:33,540
..to perform her last rites!

2635
02:27:33,620 --> 02:27:36,192
That day she will remember what
I said and die suffering!

2636
02:27:36,546 --> 02:27:37,112
Come on dear.

2637
02:27:37,466 --> 02:27:39,632
No, no stop!

2638
02:27:40,316 --> 02:27:42,607
Don't punish me so severely!

2639
02:27:43,686 --> 02:27:45,922
I am ashamed of myself.

2640
02:27:46,412 --> 02:27:47,792
Please forgive me!

2641
02:27:48,065 --> 02:27:49,559
Please forgive me!

2642
02:27:49,739 --> 02:27:51,122
Please forgive me!

2643
02:27:51,552 --> 02:27:53,392
I am ashamed of myself.

2644
02:27:55,473 --> 02:27:58,312
Yes Kailash, forgive her.

2645
02:27:59,217 --> 02:28:01,552
She is the mother-in-law
of my daughter.

2646
02:28:02,047 --> 02:28:03,752
And my sister-in-law too.

2647
02:28:05,154 --> 02:28:06,832
Then ask her to apologise to
her daughter-in-law..

2648
02:28:06,912 --> 02:28:08,832
..take her in her arms and say..

2649
02:28:08,912 --> 02:28:11,953
..daughter-in-law's
should be like you.

2650
02:28:12,091 --> 02:28:12,880
Tell her.

2651
02:28:16,616 --> 02:28:18,952
Dear.
- No, what are you doing?

2652
02:28:22,150 --> 02:28:23,512
My child.

2653
02:28:32,343 --> 02:28:33,280
Secretary!

2654
02:28:33,360 --> 02:28:37,226
Secretary where are you going?
- No, no.

2655
02:28:39,150 --> 02:28:40,785
Come on get up, you
are ruining my shoes.

2656
02:28:40,865 --> 02:28:41,832
I was cleaning it.

2657
02:28:42,381 --> 02:28:45,298
So secretary, won't you give your
madam a mischievous idea.

2658
02:28:45,378 --> 02:28:47,192
No sir. Swear on you.
Swear on your father.

2659
02:28:47,272 --> 02:28:48,272
Do you have a father?

2660
02:28:48,499 --> 02:28:50,695
I don't know that sir.
- But your idea, wonderful sir.

2661
02:28:50,775 --> 02:28:52,032
Just wonderful.

2662
02:28:52,112 --> 02:28:53,516
Stop praising, and apologise.

2663
02:28:53,596 --> 02:28:55,237
Yes sir, forgive me.
- Not me, apologise to her.

2664
02:28:55,317 --> 02:28:56,875
To her, yes.

2665
02:28:56,955 --> 02:28:57,721
Forgive me.

2666
02:28:57,801 --> 02:28:58,961
Are you apologising or begging.

2667
02:28:59,041 --> 02:29:01,325
Sorry, sorry, my fault.

2668
02:29:01,405 --> 02:29:02,864
Come on, go there.
- Yes sir, definitely.

2669
02:29:02,944 --> 02:29:05,225
Children..
- Forgive me too.

2670
02:29:06,127 --> 02:29:07,732
So, you have come
on the right track.

2671
02:29:07,997 --> 02:29:08,672
Come children!

2672
02:29:09,287 --> 02:29:10,370
Why are you standing far,
come on.

2673
02:29:10,450 --> 02:29:11,192
Come dear.

2674
02:29:11,900 --> 02:29:13,477
Bless you.

2675
02:29:14,385 --> 02:29:15,857
Mehra.
- Yes Kailash.

2676
02:29:16,012 --> 02:29:17,912
Today even I can say proudly.
- What?

2677
02:29:18,430 --> 02:29:19,992
That wife should be..
- Like her!

2678
02:29:20,072 --> 02:29:22,592
"The rose flower."

2679
02:29:23,307 --> 02:29:31,143
"One in a million is the
face of my beloved."

2680
02:29:31,962 --> 02:29:35,509
"The rose flower."
