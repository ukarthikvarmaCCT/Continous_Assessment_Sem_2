1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,772
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,772 --> 00:00:05,373
Last month more than 30,000 people
gathered in Ladakh to protest.

3
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:06,670
Watch these videos.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,275
It may not seem like a huge number.

5
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:15,882
But here, 30,000 means

6
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:19,352
more than 10% of the population of this Union territory.

7
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,738
Everyone was gathered at one place

8
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:23,025
to protest for their rights.

9
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:24,014
On 6th March,

10
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:26,625
when the discussions with the government did not yield any result,

11
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,776
the famous educator, innovator, and activist

12
00:00:28,776 --> 00:00:33,436
Sonam Wangchuk decided to go on an indefinite fast.

13
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:38,077
"I'm going on an indefinite fast

14
00:00:38,077 --> 00:00:42,954
until Ladakh's voice is heard.

15
00:00:42,954 --> 00:00:45,539
Until the government pays attention to Ladakh."

16
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,423
A 21-day fast,

17
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,549
which can become a fast till de@th.

18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,782
Think about it, if in any state in our country,

19
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:53,941
10% of the population takes to the streets protesting,

20
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:55,487
will it not be a huge news?

21
00:00:55,487 --> 00:00:58,920
But the way this news is being
suppressed by the news channels,

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,565
it is very shocking to see.

23
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:03,970
We will talk about the demands
of the protesters later in the video,

24
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,074
but, in the video, I would also like to show you

25
00:01:06,074 --> 00:01:08,156
that story isn't unique to Ladakh.

26
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:11,267
This story is playing out in
every corner of the country today.

27
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:15,279
The political corporate mafia
that is putting Ladakh in danger today,

28
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:18,559
is the same mafia that
destroyed the forests of Hasdeo,

29
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:20,580
set fire to the hills of Manipur,

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,888
and is bent on destroying Buxwaha.

31
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:25,768
The same mafia that is causing Joshimath to sink,

32
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:28,185
that caused the tunnel collapse in Uttarkashi,

33
00:01:28,185 --> 00:01:30,504
and put Lakshadweep in danger.

34
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:32,417
If this mafia is not stopped,

35
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:35,175
it will slowly devour the country like a termite.

36
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:36,823
It will make it hollow from within.

37
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:38,486
Let's understand this in today's video.

38
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:49,189
Friends, if you don't know Sonam Wangchuk,

39
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:50,464
then it is important to tell you that

40
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:53,118
he is the person who inspired

41
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,231
the character of Rancho in the film 3 Idiots.

42
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:57,967
The innovations made by Rancho in the film,

43
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:01,573
Sonam Wangchuk made similar
innovations and more in real life.

44
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:06,485
In 2021, he built these environment-friendly
solar heated tents for the Indian Army.

45
00:02:06,664 --> 00:02:08,256
With these tents, our soldiers

46
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,193
were able to stay comfortably
even in the freezing cold of Ladakh.

47
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:13,725
Apart from this, Sonam Wangchuk

48
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:17,477
has also designed many carbon
neutral solar buildings in Ladakh.

49
00:02:17,477 --> 00:02:19,883
He was the one to introduce the concept of Ice Stupas.

50
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:22,181
To deal with the water shortage in Ladakh,

51
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:23,848
he introduced this concept

52
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:25,506
of building these artificial glaciers.

53
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:29,130
Throughout the years, he has been
awarded many awards for his innovations.

54
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,185
Be it the Ramon Magsaysay Award,

55
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,508
the Green Teacher Award,

56
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:35,168
or an award by the UNESCO.

57
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:36,499
So today when this Sonam Wangchuk

58
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:38,398
is sitting on an indefinite fast,

59
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:40,722
it must be because of a serious problem.

60
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:42,742
The problem is the democracy in Ladakh,

61
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:44,282
the environment of Ladakh,

62
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:46,233
and the rights of the people of Ladakh.

63
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,915
The people of Ladakh have four main demands.

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,557
First, including Ladakh in the
6th Schedule of the Constitution.

65
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:55,260
Second, giving full statehood to Ladakh.

66
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:58,303
Third, electing 2 MPs from Ladakh.

67
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,977
Currently, there's only 1 MP
is from Ladakh in the Lok Sabha,

68
00:03:01,977 --> 00:03:03,615
and 0 MPs in the Rajya Sabha.

69
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:08,590
And fourth, establishing a Public Service
Commission to provide secure jobs in Ladakh.

70
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,419
Let's understand each of them in detail.

71
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:12,330
First, what is this 6th Schedule?

72
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,905
This is the part of the Constitution

73
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:18,390
that protects the tribal population in the country.

74
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,180
According to this, in tribal areas,

75
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,972
to promote democracy, the tribal people

76
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:25,208
can form their own Autonomous District Councils

77
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,786
and Autonomous Regional Councils.

78
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:29,836
Also known as ADCs and ARCs.

79
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:31,783
They are basically elected bodies

80
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:35,022
that have the power to administer tribal areas.

81
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:36,358
So that on a local level, the tribal people

82
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:42,128
make their rules about their land,
forest, and socio-cultural customs.

83
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:46,249
So that people from outside
cannot exploit their land and resources.

84
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:48,776
Today, this 6th Schedule is applicable

85
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:53,085
in the tribal areas of Assam,
Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.

86
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:55,565
Now you might think,
since there are no forests in Ladakh,

87
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:57,736
why are the people of Ladakh demanding it?

88
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,522
There are three main reasons for this.

89
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:02,946
First, it is true that there aren't forests in Ladakh,

90
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:05,787
but every area has its natural biodiversity.

91
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,755
And Sonam Wangchuk has explained this many times

92
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:09,047
that the area of Ladakh

93
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:12,809
is very vulnerable, considering climate change.

94
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:16,648
"The mountains are facing the wrath of nature

95
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:18,668
in the face of climate change."

96
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:21,370
If the resources are allowed to be exploited in this area,

97
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,369
it will be largely dangerous for Ladakh.

98
00:04:23,369 --> 00:04:27,418
The frequency of natural disasters,
flash floods, and landslides will increase.

99
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:29,770
Second, the majority population of Ladakh

100
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,273
falls in the Scheduled Tribes category.

101
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:33,460
According to NCST,

102
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,396
66.8% of the population of Leh is Scheduled Tribe.

103
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:38,973
83% in Kargil,

104
00:04:38,973 --> 00:04:42,271
and in some areas it is as high as 99%.

105
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:43,669
The third and the biggest reason,

106
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,031
the 6th Schedule will give the people
of Ladakh their democratic rights.

107
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:51,199
Today, what do the people of
Ladakh have in terms of democracy?

108
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,383
Think about it yourself.

109
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:55,849
Since the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019,

110
00:04:55,849 --> 00:05:00,116
Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir were
divided into a separate Union Territories.

111
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:02,606
People didn't have any issues
with the abrogation of Article 370,

112
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:05,310
rather, their issues are with the actions
of the government after the abrogation.

113
00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:08,205
J&K used to be a full state.

114
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:10,956
After 2019, it was downgraded

115
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:13,012
and divided into two separate Union Territories.

116
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,456
This is what J&K's former
Governor Satyapal Malik had said.

117
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,868
"More than the abrogation of Article 370,

118
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:20,088
they feel bad about this."

119
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,695
"Absolutely, so why did you do this?"

120
00:05:21,896 --> 00:05:23,437
"I didn't play any part in this.

121
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:25,064
Had they asked, I would
have warned them against it."

122
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:30,326
J&K's Union Territory did get its Legislative Assembly.

123
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:32,797
But Ladakh wasn't given that right.

124
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:36,304
Before 2019, when J&K used to be a full state,

125
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,805
there were 4 MLAs from Ladakh.

126
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,381
But today, this number has come down to zero.

127
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:42,678
Delhi is also a Union Territory,

128
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:45,415
but there exists a state level government.

129
00:05:45,415 --> 00:05:47,774
You can vote for them,
you can elect them.

130
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:49,037
Now, it's a different issue that

131
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:50,363
the Central Government has tried

132
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:53,611
its best to take away powers from the Delhi Government,

133
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:54,856
over the last few years.

134
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:57,320
But Ladakh wasn't given this right at all.

135
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,143
There are no offices at the state level,

136
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:00,823
that you can elect by voting.

137
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:01,926
At the next level,

138
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:05,429
people of Ladakh can vote for the Lok Sabha elections only,

139
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:06,815
but even there,

140
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:08,777
they have been given only 1 MP.

141
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:10,555
This is the reason behind all these demands.

142
00:06:10,555 --> 00:06:12,999
On a local level, they want to be included in the 6th Schedule,

143
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,576
so that they can elect their ADCs and ARCs,

144
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,255
and can protect their land.

145
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:19,579
On a state level, they want full statehood.

146
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,492
But if that isn't possible,

147
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:22,505
they want at least a Legislative Assembly

148
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:23,977
so that they can elect their government.

149
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:25,168
And on a central level,

150
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:26,272
they want to have 2 MPs.

151
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:29,058
Otherwise, this is only a shell of democracy?

152
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:30,598
Friends, the most interesting thing is that

153
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,687
it doesn't matter whether

154
00:06:31,687 --> 00:06:33,741
you agree with my reasoning or not.

155
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,203
Because 4 years ago,

156
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:37,165
BJP was the one to demand

157
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:39,581
that Ladakh be included in the 6th Schedule.

158
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:41,272
What could be the reason

159
00:06:41,272 --> 00:06:44,139
that BJP doesn't want to fulfil this demand now?

160
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,770
It's an interesting reason

161
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,335
and quite predictable

162
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:49,683
if you understand BJP's politics.

163
00:06:49,683 --> 00:06:52,228
I will talk about this reason in a while,

164
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:55,990
but before that, if you want to
understand the Indian Constitution properly,

165
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,166
then I would like to recommend
this audiobook on Kuku FM.

166
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,663
Bhartiya Samvidhan: Ankahi Kahani

167
00:07:01,931 --> 00:07:06,768
It explains in detail how our country's
great Constitution was actually drafted.

168
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:08,608
The history behind it.

169
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:10,074
If you don't know Kuku FM,

170
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:11,727
it is an audio learning platform

171
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:14,129

00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:30,308
Now let's get back to the topic.

178
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:31,731
In fact, not only a demand,

179
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:34,607
right at the top of BJP's manifesto,

180
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:36,591
they mentioned including Ladakh in the 6th Schedule.

181
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,117
You can read what they've
clearly written in their manifesto.

182
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:41,905
"I have shown this earlier,

183
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:43,205
today I will show it again,

184
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:47,342
in 2019, during the Lok Sabha elections,

185
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,020
in the third bullet point of you manifesto,

186
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,082
you had promised to safeguard
Ladakh in the 6th Schedule."

187
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:56,179
September 2019 was the first time that

188
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,906
the National Commission for
Scheduled Tribes had recommended

189
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:01,075
the inclusion of Ladakh in the 6th Schedule.

190
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,899
But the government did not take any action.

191
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,019
In August 2020, the people of Ladakh

192
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,304
put their demands in front
of the government for the first time.

193
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:08,661
In September 2020,

194
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:11,492
the first mass protest took
place in Ladakh regarding this.

195
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:19,001
In 2020, the Autonomous Hill District
Council was to be elected in Ladakh.

196
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:22,069
And before the elections,
Home Minister Amit Shah promised that

197
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,320
within 15 days of the election,

198
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,742
they would fulfil these demands.

199
00:08:25,742 --> 00:08:27,792
After this, the protests were called off

200
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:30,533
and BJP won the elections with 15 seats.

201
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:33,015
But after that, no action was taken.

202
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:36,832
During December 2021 and November 2022,
there were two more protests.

203
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:41,525
For a while, there were discussions with the government

204
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:43,616
but despite writing in on the manifesto,

205
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:46,066
the government kept refusing to give in to their demand.

206
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:50,124
This is the reason for this indefinite fast today.

207
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:51,866
It didn't escalate all of a sudden.

208
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,554
As you can see, over the last few years,

209
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:56,004
people have been raising their demands repeatedly.

210
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:57,824
But the biggest question here is,

211
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:59,911
What is Modi government's problem

212
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,084
with fulfilling this demand?

213
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,130
Adding the people of Ladakh to the 6th Schedule,

214
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,523
will not bring the nation crumbling down.

215
00:09:06,523 --> 00:09:07,728
It's a simple demand.

216
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:10,823
And there won't be any backlash for the
Modi government or BJP if they do this.

217
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:14,252
After all, they were the ones to include this in their manifesto.

218
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,390
What could be the reason behind this refusal?

219
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,430
I would like you to read a line
about the functions of ADCs.

220
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,430
Look at the screen.

221
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,010
"The district and regional councils

222
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,390
administer the areas under their jurisdiction.

223
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,900
They can make laws on certain specified matters

224
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,860
like land, forests, canal water, shifting cultivation..."

225
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,070
Did you notice it?

226
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,740
Lands, Forests.

227
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,120
This means that if Ladakh is added to the 6th Schedule,

228
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,490
then the Modi government won't have power

229
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,620
over the Ladakh's land.

230
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,960
This means that Ladakh's land and forests,

231
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,010
cannot be sold be PM Modi to his friend.

232
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,990
"They wanted every valley here

233
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,610
to be mined and have industries set up,

234
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,830
but Ladakh's people are wary of this."

235
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,090
Sonam Wangchuk and Ladakh's people don't want

236
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,530
their lands to be opened up for corporate exploitation.

237
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,340
Doing this will not mean taking away
the rights of the people living there,

238
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,290
but it will also be very dangerous
for our country's environment.

239
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,430
Ladakh is a beautiful and
ecologically sensitive part of our country.

240
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,230
The mountains and valleys here are so unique that

241
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,270
you can't find such features
anywhere else in the world.

242
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,980
The world's rarest and most
endangered animal species are found here.

243
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,630
Like the snow leopards or the Tibetan antelopes.

244
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,570
The water of the lakes here is so crystal clear,

245
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,550
you won't even believe that

246
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,750
such clarity can be found anywhere.

247
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,460
And if you have ever been to Ladakh,

248
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,900
then you must know how innocent
and pure-hearted these people are.

249
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,950
Their culture and tradition,

250
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,880
these monasteries and festivals

251
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,920
are so amazing that

252
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,410
people from all over the world come to see them.

253
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,610
I believe that it is every Indian's duty

254
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,730
to protect the environment and
cultural diversity of a place like Ladakh.

255
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,570
Places like these are like precious gems in our country.

256
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,430
But the way our government is
treating these precious gems today,

257
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,570
tells you a lot about the government's intention.

258
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,230
How long has it been since Manipur is on fire?

259
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,840
It's in a state of civil war

260
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,450
and PM Modi is not willing to even visit that state.

261
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,990
And the reason for Manipur's terrible situation

262
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,060
is corporate exploitation.

263
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,390
I explained it in this video.

264
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,000
There's deforestation of the Hasdeo jungle in Chhattisgarh.

265
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,300
People made countless reels
to protect the forest.

266
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,810
But the government opened it up for mining.

267
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,240
Who is benefiting from this?

268
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,960
The people?

269
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,270
Or Prime Minister's friends at the top?

270
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,080
This story isn't about Ladakh, Manipur or Hasdeo only.

271
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,570
On a large scale, they are trying to

272
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,670
sell the forests of the country.

273
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,240
To sell our mountains,

274
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,660
and to sell our land.

275
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,910
And the benefit from the corporate exploitation,

276
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,760
goes to a select few at the top of hierarchy.

277
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,120
If you still can't see the connection,

278
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,540
click here to watch this video.

279
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,710
You'll understand this funda thoroughly.

280
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,070
Thank you very much!
