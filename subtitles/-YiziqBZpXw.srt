1
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:08,014
Now its Guttu turn

2
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:10,573
Now kids of people who make pickle will debate with our kids 

3
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:38,609
Again this nightmare,I need to do something

4
00:00:51,194 --> 00:01:03,389
This mother will go to the skies to make her guttu perfect, if you think your mother made you perfect too please watch the video and share too

5
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:12,000
The study is alright but one must know English and its weak for guttu, that's whats is in the trend

6
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:18,510
You said it right Sarita, 100 percent true

7
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:31,095
All this nonsense in social media is crazier, people are nude, I was thinking there shall be a time when old people like us will walk in bikini

8
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:38,450
Haa you said right now give me tea ,its so cold

9
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:51,593
Just go straight then right

10
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,319
Hey what happened?

11
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:06,923
We looking for english speaking classes

12
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:09,514
Cant you see consulting hour its 11am to 1pm

13
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:21,669
I can see everything, I just visited an eye doctor but with English its get hazy

14
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:28,843
If you are weak with english please go away

15
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,504
Where ?  to the classes ??

16
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:37,344
Ohh God NO, classes are full

17
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:42,859
Take some extra money and get us seats,adjust a little bit

18
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:57,757
What Sarita such an embrassement ?

19
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:10,043
With all those house chores we got no idea what English language hold such importance,but this should not happen with our kids

20
00:03:51,669 --> 00:04:04,863
What all vulgur songs you kids are listening? All of the sudden you need to become adult,One nice slap and you will get your senses back

21
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:19,003

22
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:30,164

23
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:39,449
Ohh wow how magical this song is

24
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,414
True aunty why dont you play this song in your kitty party

25
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:52,910
Guttu it was fun though

26
00:04:55,463 --> 00:05:02,040
