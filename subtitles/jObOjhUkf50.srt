1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
In this video,

2
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:04,437
we're going
on a $250,000 vacation.

3
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,505
This is beautiful.

4
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,140
How is this real?

5
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:09,943
And I'm going to show you
the difference between

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,179
this and a $100,000
presidential vacation.

7
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:14,247
Right this way, sir.

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,150
A $50,000 vacation where we have
the Eiffel Tower

9
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,551
completely to ourselves.

10
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,020
I'm holding on for dear life.

11
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,756
All the way down to this $1 vacation.

12
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:25,692
Right over here, boys.
This shack is our vacation.

13
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,395
- You can see inside of it.
- There's no walls, Jimmy.

14
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,031
- Well, I mean, there is walls.
- This is gross.

15
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,133
And in case you don't believe me,
it's a dollar.

16
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,502
- Look at that.
- Oh, it's $0.93. You're a liar.

17
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,404
I rounded up to a dollar. For $1

18
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,639
we get this bed, which is honestly
just a mattress

19
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,041
sitting on wood planks,

20
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,910
a broken cabinet,
a light that sort of works.

21
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,745
Oh, look at that.

22
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,415
And lastly, random noises
coming from the ceiling.

23
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,651
I was hearing noises in the room,
and there's a raccoon on our roof.

24
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,754
I feel like most people would be mad
if their hotel room had a raccoon.

25
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,222
But for some reason, we're happy.

26
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,291
- When is the check out time?
- Tomorrow.

27
00:00:58,324 --> 00:00:59,726
Keep in mind that
later in this video,

28
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:01,761
we're going on a $100,000 vacation.

29
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,696
A $250,000 vacation.

30
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,432
Can we just jump to that already?

31
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:06,933
No, because we got to suffer

32
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,768
so they can compare our
suffering to our happiness.

33
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,103
They do like when we suffer.

34
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,704
Are we all supposed
to fit on a single bed?

35
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,174
If we wanted four beds,
that'd be $4.

36
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,909
First, let's get all this sand out.

37
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,046
The raccoon just ran in here.

38
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,115
I'm gonna act like I didn't scream
like a little girl.

39
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:22,849
Up next,

40
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,652
a vacation that's 10,000 times
more expensive.

41
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,488
Welcome to the
$10,000 a night vacation.

42
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,757
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yo, this is sick!

43
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,659
Wait, what the heck is this?

44
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,494
This hotel room has jellyfish.

45
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:37,097
- Okay, that's so unnecessary.
- Oh, there's a pool outside.

46
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:38,631
It's a private pool.

47
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,967
Does this not look like a scene
from a movie?

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,269
Your hotel room walks
out to the beach.

49
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,271
- Wow.
- Is this our own private beach?

50
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,506
Oh, my gosh.

51
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,440
This is incredible.

52
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,142
Tareq, since when is water this blue?

53
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,376
I don't know.

54
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,513
This all inclusive vacation
also has a giant spa.

55
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,215
Oh, yeah.

56
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,749
A park filled with flamingos.

57
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,485
Oh, they're fighting

58
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,354
- Flamingos.
- And unlimited room service.

59
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,589
Okay, what do you need?

60
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:03,523
All of it.

61
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,993
The only negative of this place
is it doesn't have a raccoon.

62
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,461
Hey, little guy.

63
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:09,696
But I don't blame them for that.

64
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,732
When you spend $10,000
at this all inclusive resort,

65
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,667
we each get our own floor
of the building.

66
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,837
It looks exactly like Jimmy's,
except for I got the top floor.

67
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,305
Oh, I have a hammock.

68
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,541
I think I can make it in the hammock
without getting wet.

69
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:22,842
I didn't.

70
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,945
Yo, look at your view!

71
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,313
- Chris!
- Hey.

72
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:29,949
I caught it.

73
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,451
- 3, 2, 1â€¦
- Hey!

74
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,753
All right, let me lay out
some rules.

75
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,221
- Rule number one.
- Yeah.

76
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,056
No more throwing pillows in my pool.

77
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,559
Rule number two.

78
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,595
Sorry, Tareq. And now
what the hotel is known for,

79
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,297
this insane infinity pool

80
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,399
that extends over our
own personal beach.

81
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,735
How does the water just not overflow?

82
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,537
I have so many questions.

83
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,239
I feel like a father
that took his kids on vacation

84
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,842
and is just watching them
hang out in the pool.

85
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,245
The $10,000 vacation has been insane,

86
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,414
but not as insane
as our next vacation

87
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,183
all the way across the planet.

88
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:07,253
And now the $50,000
vacation in Paris.

89
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,322
- Oui!
- Baguette!

90
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,157
Our $50,000 vacation

91
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,427
starts with a completely
private luxury ferry ride.

92
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,062
What is that? That's the engine?

93
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:19,432
Bro, what is this, 1805?
Tareq, zoom in on that guy.

94
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,100
He is filming us. Hey.

95
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,836
- They waved back.
- Do you have a YouTube channel?

96
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,073
I don't think he speaks English.

97
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,909
This vacation comes complete
with fantastic food.

98
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,312
A tour of the entire city.

99
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:32,912
All right.

100
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,582
And a luxury hotel room
with an amazing view.

101
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,483
- This is kind of romantic, huh?
- Yeah.

102
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,985
You and Chandler should kiss.

103
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,088
And lastly,
we have a very expensive surprise.

104
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,623
So you guys are probably wondering,

105
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,124
it's a $50,000 vacation,

106
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,460
and we clearly haven't
spent 50 grand yet.

107
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,661
Yeah, where is it?

108
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,797
It's behind you.

109
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,532
That's the Eiffel Tower.

110
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,835
Yes. We have the entire Eiffel Tower
completely to ourselves.

111
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,569
Wait, actually?

112
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,036
Yeah.

113
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,205
What portion of the 50 grand
was the tower?

114
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,173
Almost all of it.

115
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,976
We are at the Eiffel Tower.

116
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,177
This feels like we're sneaking in.

117
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,746
No, I'm not joking. It's ours.
No one else is here.

118
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,414
We can just go
straight through the line.

119
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,415
This feels illegal.

120
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,318
Most of the time,
this place is packed with people.

121
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,255
And because we have the whole thing
completely to ourselves,

122
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,257
we're going to try
to get to the top of the tower.

123
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,392
I'm talking the very top.

124
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,527
Boys, enough playing around.
Let's head up.

125
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,395
On the way up,

126
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:26,399
we stopped at the first floor,
over 187 feet in the air,

127
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,302
where we had a world class restaurant
all to ourselves.

128
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,738
I love though, even though
we have the entire Eiffel Tower,

129
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,706
they still put us
in a corner of the restaurant.

130
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:35,942
That's the elevator

131
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,577
coming from the top
of the Eiffel Tower.

132
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,545
That looks terrifying. Open sesame.

133
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,381
Thank you. I can see
my house from up here.

134
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,282
We're in France.

135
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,883
I can see my hotel from up here.

136
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,753
- Look how high up we are.
- Oh, my ears are popping.

137
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,488
What are we working with here?

138
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:49,355
Oh, my gosh.

139
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,257
You can see the whole city from here.

140
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,325
This is crazy.

141
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,861
Tareq.
Look how much higher we have to go.

142
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:55,995
This is never going to end.

143
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,298
I'm not going to lie,
I thought we were already at the top.

144
00:04:59,032 --> 00:04:59,966
We're going up.

145
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,634
Now we're heading to the top.
At one point,

146
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,336
this was the tallest building
in the world.

147
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,471
- Should I jump right now?
- No. Do not move.

148
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,507
Come on, boys, follow me.

149
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,443
From here on out, there's no more
elevators, just stairs.

150
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,944
Oh, it's windy up here.

151
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,781
We are high up there. Oh, my God.

152
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,716
Oh, my God.

153
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,451
Tareq,
don't drop the camera.

154
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,987
We are standing over
900 feet in the air.

155
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,556
The highest point
civilians are allowed on the tower.

156
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,526
But since it's ours for the night,
I had one last surprise.

157
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,727
What do you think's
behind this door?

158
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,561
Stairs.

159
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,596
Actually, did I...

160
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,265
- How did you know?
- We can see the stairs.

161
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,700
Well, yes, there are more stairs,

162
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,668
but this takes us
to the very top

163
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,103
where no one's allowed to go.

164
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,739
Oh, my gosh.

165
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:41,741
Bro.

166
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,742
Oh, my God.

167
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,677
- Are we allowed on that?
- I don't know.

168
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,013
Oh, that is scary.

169
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,015
The ledge just comes up
to my waist up here.

170
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,350
I am holding on for dear life.

171
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,819
I completely understand
why tourists are not allowed up here.

172
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,654
We have a cameraman
on the other side of the city

173
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,955
with a lens zoomed in on us.

174
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,490
He's over a mile away.

175
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,025
If this lens is good enough,

176
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,562
you should be able to see us
waving for a $50,000 vacation.

177
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,963
You got to admit,
this is cool.

178
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:04,831
This is amazing.

179
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,265
It'a a once in a lifetime experience.

180
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,368
Are you ready
for the best moment yet?

181
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,771
I don't know why a YouTuber
has this much power, but lights.

182
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,474
Oh, there we go.

183
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,342
Oh, my God.

184
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,677
Like a disco show.

185
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,912
Holy cow!

186
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,915
Guys, I don't know
if this next command

187
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,852
is going to work,
but turn every light off.

188
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,525
Oh, it's pitch black.

189
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,127
The Eiffel Tower went dark.

190
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,896
What are these millions of French
people thinking right now?

191
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:40,933
They should get me off this tower.

192
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,802
I don't know why
they gave me this much control.

193
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,305
Next, we head to Switzerland
for the $100,000 vacation.

194
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,875
But this is no ordinary vacation.

195
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,744
This hotel has two inch thick,
bulletproof windows,

196
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,046
a panic button that will lock down
the entire building

197
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,382
and it's riddled with security
because this is a hotel

198
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,851
where world leaders and presidents
take their vacation.

199
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,387
And also the sidemen were in town.
So I invited them to come.

200
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,289
Oh, my God.

201
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,524
It smells like food in here.

202
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,192
We've got the whole ocean in there.

203
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,927
- What?
- This is nuts.

204
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,130
This is the most expensive penthouse
suite in all of Europe.

205
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,766
It covers the whole eighth floor,
has dozens of rooms,

206
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,668
tons of staff waiting
on you day and night

207
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,004
and absolutely crazy food everywhere.

208
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,806
You want a hit?
Yeah, get a hit of that.

209
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:21,340
Oh, yeah.

210
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,242
How do these guys compare
to your normal guests?

211
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,212
So you'd say they're
pretty dumb compared toâ€¦

212
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,382
Like I said before, some
of the most powerful world leaders

213
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,150
choose this place
for their vacations.

214
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,387
Even Bill Clinton stayed here
and he wasn't assassinated.

215
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,154
It's pretty safe.

216
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,990
In terms of security, here you
have the bulletproof windows.

217
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,759
Even this is bulletproof.

218
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,627
Oh, my. It feels thick.

219
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,396
Pretty solid.

220
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,697
I hope. I'm a president.

221
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,566
There are also some snipers

222
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,934
that we can put on the rooftop.

223
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,435
You have your own snipers.

224
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,706
Are you able to negotiate
on behalf of the Sideman?

225
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,174
- I can try my best.
- Yes.

226
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,009
This will help me in my negotiation.

227
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,711
I'd like to buy a 10%.

228
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,180
- How much, boys?
- Go, you say it.

229
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,815
200 million, Jimmy.

230
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,083
200 million.

231
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,453
All right. To the panic button.

232
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,055
- Oh, no.
- I'm not going to lie.

233
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,457
I've been wanting to press
this button since we got here.

234
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,359
We all agree this is a good idea.

235
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,827
- No.
- No.

236
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,896
Karl. You're Bill Clinton,
and you feel threatened.

237
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,232
Press the panic button.
You pressed it.

238
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:22,335
Oh, wait.

239
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,203
- I see a door closed.
- Are we locked in?

240
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,638
- Is it locked?
- Are you guys in there?

241
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,405
Is that Nolan?

242
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,940
Yeah. The door's like shut.

243
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,308
I walked off for one second.

244
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,776
This button opens it.

245
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,112
You don't get to panic
and then open it.

246
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,947
If you press the button now,

247
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,882
the police will come.

248
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:36,883
And there's a big fine.

249
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:37,984
Don't press it again.

250
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,052
I've been thinking.

251
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,588
How would a president
get somewhere like McDonald's?

252
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,657
Let's see how presidents travel.
Come on in.

253
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,225
It turns out
when you're the president,

254
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,327
you have to go everywhere
with your bodyguards.

255
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,162
So that means that when you driveâ€¦

256
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,998
Oh, we got an entourage.

257
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,299
How do we know which car to get into?

258
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,467
On the third or the fourth.

259
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,835
Ideally the third or fourth.

260
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,271
- Which car is the most dangerous?
- The first one.

261
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,539
Nolan, you should ride
the first one.

262
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,207
- I can do that.
- Okay.

263
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,141
Who wants to ride with me?

264
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,009
Harry, come on in.

265
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,709
Harry, Chandler.

266
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,211
I'm sure the president
doesnâ€™t sit in the middle.

267
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,913
Typically,
you guys would be my bodyguards.

268
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,281
But, you know, you'll suffice.

269
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,849
Just squeeze in mate.
Squeeze in.

270
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,984
What president
is going to McDonald's?

271
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,053
Does your window roll down?
Hey, how's it going?

272
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,856
Now we're gonna get shot!

273
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,157
I can't believe we can do this.

274
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,392
This is nice.

275
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,594
Turns out when you travel
in a presidential motorcade,

276
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,229
a lot of people start to notice you.

277
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,030
How's it going?

278
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:24,997
This is bonkers, man.

279
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,732
I love how we just draw
the attention of everyone.

280
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:27,400
People are filming,

281
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,701
like we're the president.
This is weird.

282
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,603
Which made McDonald's
a little awkward.

283
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,874
What's going on?

284
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,142
Don't mind our security.

285
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,344
Jimmy, does this beat out
the Eiffel Tower for you?

286
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,845
Depends how good these nuggets are.

287
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,314
Obviously, all of the vacations

288
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,415
so far have been amazing,

289
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,584
but they pale in comparison
to the next one.

290
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,287
Our final vacation is once again
across the planet.

291
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,657
And now we're in Japan
for the $250,000 vacation

292
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,559
and we're meeting up
with a special guest here,

293
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,294
so you're gonna want
to watch till the end.

294
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,829
To start off our vacation

295
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,633
we dropped off our bags in the most
expensive hotel in all of Japan.

296
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,701
This is gigantic.

297
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,469
I have an echo in a hotel room.

298
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,370
And afterwards,

299
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,672
we felt like getting to know
the city of Tokyo.

300
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,774
Now we're going to drive
Mario Karts on the street.

301
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,244
We rented private Mario Karts

302
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:15,047
but we get to literally drive
on the streets of Japan.

303
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,482
People are just staring at us.

304
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,084
This is not meant to be on a street.

305
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,319
There's real cars
driving right beside me.

306
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,622
Well, look how many people
are crossing the street here.

307
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:23,522
This is the busiest

308
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,025
crosswalk in the world,
and we're driving right through it.

309
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,428
We're on Go-karts in Tokyo.
Go-karts!

310
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,429
I love Japan.

311
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,764
This place is crazy.

312
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,733
When we arrived
at our next destination,

313
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,502
we met with master swordsman
Yoshioki Sumida.

314
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,505
He's been training with the katana
for the last 26 years,

315
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,008
and he actually agreed to giving us
a rare lesson

316
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,376
in the art of the Samurai.

317
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,611
We each got our own katanas

318
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,147
and the lesson began
with swinging techniques.

319
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,384
It was not as easy as we thought.

320
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,290
No, they're going to zoom in on it.

321
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,492
Then it was my turn.

322
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,193
Boys, you think I'm gonna
be able to do this?

323
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,895
- Yes.
- Yeah, you got it.

324
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,568
Hey! Let's see how the boys do.

325
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

326
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,175
Who am I?

327
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,713
And then, our samurai teacher
gifted us this insane katana.

328
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,281
I don't deserve this, but thank you.

329
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,750
And because this is a quarter million
dollar vacation,

330
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,920
we rented out the most premium
sushi chef in the world,

331
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,056
along with this entire
floating restaurant.

332
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,757
They got Louis Vuitton coasters.

333
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,760
The chef makes all the food right
next to our table, and getting to see

334
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,596
a master at work was one of
the coolest dining experiences

335
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,631
I've ever had.

336
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,667
Oh, wow.

337
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,601
Oh, my God.

338
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,371
They said we could
feed the birds tuna.

339
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,672
Here you go, little man

340
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,873
See how he caught him
in the air?

341
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,008
And once we paid the billâ€¦

342
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,409
Thank you.

343
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,611
we were off to the craziest place
I've ever been.

344
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,313
Follow me.
I rented this whole place.

345
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,215
But before we see it, socks off.

346
00:11:56,282 --> 00:12:00,052
This is basically an art museum,
but for experience.

347
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,089
Oh, my God.

348
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,290
I have goosebumps.

349
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,726
My eyes are having a hard time
processing it.

350
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,761
You think this is what it looks like
when you die?

351
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:09,695
Probably.

352
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,464
What is this next room?

353
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,700
Normally, this place
is completely full of other people,

354
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,436
but we secured the entire experience
for ourselves.

355
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,538
This might be one of the best things
we've ever done.

356
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,307
Dude, are these fish?

357
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,408
We're in a pool,

358
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,111
in a museum playing
with animated fish.

359
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,880
This is the most unique thing
you could ever do on a vacation.

360
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,482
Wait, the fish are surrounding us.

361
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:30,916
How did they know to surround us?

362
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,884
They love us.

363
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,219
They're going everywhere now.

364
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,787
Now you're all probably hungry.

365
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,757
Which is why we're at this restaurant
that is ran by robots.

366
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,390
What?

367
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,625
My name is Pepper.

368
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,926
Can we have a seat, Pepper?

369
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,562
Sure.
Let's find a comfortable spot.

370
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,131
We've reserved the entire place,

371
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,666
so the only other people here
were the robot waiters.

372
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:48,834
Food robot is here.

373
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,736
Wait, so the food is delivered
on a robot?

374
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,438
An oddly fluffy robot.

375
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,673
Pepper staring really hard
at Chandler.

376
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,375
Pepper does not like Chandler.

377
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,110
Bro, I did nothing to you.

378
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,213
Everyone make sure
you eat tons of food

379
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,749
'cause tomorrow I rented
an entire theme park

380
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,519
and PewDiePie is going to be there,
which is really crazy.

381
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,755
You see, PewDiePie
and I have a long history.

382
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,191
I was wondering
when you would show up.

383
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,261
We helped him in a subscriber race
against T-series.

384
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,028
Grab your phone.

385
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,631
Go on YouTube, search PewDiePie
and subscribe to him.

386
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,466
Eventually, we even caught up to him.

387
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,869
Mr. Beast has taken
over me in subscribers.

388
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,938
I guess I'm getting a taste
of my own medicine.

389
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,439
That's all right.
He definitely deserves it.

390
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,008
And even though we've
been friends for a while,

391
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,843
we've never actually met in person.

392
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,145
And because this is such
a long awaited meetup,

393
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,447
I rented this entire amusement park.

394
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,249
This is Fuji-Q Highland,

395
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,019
the park with the scariest rides
in all of Japan.

396
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,555
It usually has thousands of people
waiting in line.

397
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,722
But as per usual,

398
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,091
I rented the whole thing
just for us.

399
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,993
You can ride whatever ride you want.

400
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,296
I wasn't done but he left.

401
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,464
I'm about to go on this entire
roller coaster alone.

402
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,201
What you're seeing here is
the steepest roller coaster drop

403
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:55,935
in the world.

404
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:56,769
Are you scared?

405
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,537
- Yes.
- Have fun!

406
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,611
I'm scared for him.

407
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,114
And like I promised,

408
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:13,652
the father of YouTube,
PewDiePie, met us in the park.

409
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:18,023
A little later than planned
because I texted on the wrong day.

410
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:18,858
Sorry, Felix.

411
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,560
And he wanted to ride
the craziest coaster at the park.

412
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,294
Why are you scared?

413
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,163
I'm so scared of roller coasters.

414
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,564
This is one doesn't spin at all.

415
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,066
I'll ride it if Felix rides it.

416
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,201
- Let's go!
- I'm terrified.

417
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,437
I'll do it. I'll do it.

418
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,006
If I die on this roller coaster,
you guys are going to feel terrible.

419
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,840
You take your shoes off?

420
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,743
- Anything that could fly out.
- That's how you know this is bad.

421
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,912
They don't even trust us
with shoes on this ride.

422
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,680
You got this. You'll be fine.

423
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,648
I cannot.

424
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,149
This was my worst nightmare.

425
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,185
I'm scared, I don't want
to do this.

426
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,653
You're scaring me. Calm down!

427
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,290
Whatever you do, don't throw up.

428
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,158
I'm terrified.
Can we pick a better one?

429
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,027
We could have picked
a nice, comfortable ride.

430
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,395
I actually have no idea what it is.

431
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,998
At some point,
there's a literal 90 degree drop.

432
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,901
You're freaking me out.
What did you sign me up for?

433
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,469
You brought me here.

434
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,039
But what we didn't know was

435
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,274
this ride goes backwards.

436
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,708
Why are we going backwards?

437
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,980
Why did I do this?

438
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,116
Oh, my God. We're upside down!

439
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:18,951
Jimmy!

440
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,322
This is crazy!

441
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,391
Best roller coaster ever!

442
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,525
Oh, my gosh.

443
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,027
Felix, what did we just do?

444
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,961
I'm crying.

445
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,129
Best roller coaster ever.

446
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,031
I got tears just running down.

447
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,067
It was good meeting you, Jimmy.
I'm gonna head out.

448
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,068
Oh, yeah.

449
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,038
You screamed
at the first little bow.

450
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:41,740
What?

451
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,175
Thank you.

452
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,045
I don't think I've ever had
a chewy potato before.

453
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,948
That's what you get for passing me.

454
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,750
Felix, I'm sorry for passing you.

455
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,886
You don't have to threaten me
with violence though.

456
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,554
- They're good.
- Yeah, they are good.

457
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,057
That was the $250,000 vacation.

458
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,959
Felix, can you transition us?

459
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,093
Bro fist.
