1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:03,336
If I gave you the choice to either buy
30 Lamborghinis or help save

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:07,048
the lives of 10,000 people in one year,
which would you choose?

3
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:11,528
We decided to do this.

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,638
Cue the epic highlight reel of the year.

5
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,937
We started this mission in Khayelitsha,
South Africa,

6
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,523
where we found an orphanage
that was in desperate

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:27,027
need of our help because it was at risk
of being closed down.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,863
I started back then, I saved more than

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,574
5330 children.

10
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,451
Those children would be dead.

11
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:39,080
But we keep on opening the doors,
knowing that maybe someone

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,666
will come to our rescue.

13
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,544
Like Beast Philanthropy.

14
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,256
So we spent the next

15
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,718
six months working
tirelessly by rebuilding 12 new homes

16
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:56,014
with an ongoing supply of fresh food,
as well as a brand new playground.

17
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,932
While the orphanage was being built,

18
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,225
we begin our next project,

19
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:03,188
where we gave away
20,000 pairs of shoes to kids in Africa.

20
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,857
Beast Philanthropy,
what you have done here at my school

21
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,692
is absolutely amazing.

22
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:11,071
Thank you Mr Beast!

23
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,199
Darren then flew to the Hopi Reservation

24
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,035
in Arizona,
where he met with Wendy.

25
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:22,165
There are over
10,000 members of the Hopi tribe.

26
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,793
These people don't have very much,
but they are

27
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,670
some of the most generous people
you'll ever meet.

28
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,172
The Hopi tribe is situated

29
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:33,051
hundreds of miles away from the closest
quality clothing and food stores,

30
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,845
which is bad because the winters here
get freezing cold

31
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:39,516
and they need all the help they can get
to stay warm and put food on the table.

32
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:43,603
When we realized just how difficult it was
for them to get access to these basic

33
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:48,817
neccessities, we decided to donate over
$2.7 million of clothing.

34
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,780
It was amazing.

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,783
Our kids, our people are just so happy.

36
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,576
Thank you, MrBeast.

37
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:02,330
We then found out that there is
an abnormally high number of amputees

38
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,289
throughout Cambodia,

39
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,752
so we partnered with Exceed Worldwide
to give away 2000 prosthetic limbs.

40
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,630
What we've experienced
is that it's so much more than a limb.

41
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,966
We're giving back people
their independence.

42
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,175
But most important,

43
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,929
I realized that we we're giving them back
their dignity and their self-esteem.

44
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:18,972
I’m so excited.

45
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,598
and I really thank you!

46
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,936
Darren and Dan
then flew to a remote island in Colombia

47
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,981
where they capsized a boat
and fell in a river filled with

48
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,606
crocodiles!

49
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,524
While they were there,

50
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,692
they built a solar grid

51
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,154
which gave the island electricity
and WiFi for the first time,

52
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,283
which will give the kids on the island
the ability to access education online.

53
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,661
We also built a bakery to empower
the woman in this community, which

54
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,205
from day one was a hit.

55
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:47,750
We then travelled to Kenya, where fresh
drinking water is extremely scarce.

56
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,213
I am a father of six children
and I want to be the best father of all.

57
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:56,134
That's why I work so
hard to maintain my bread.

58
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:56,968
My bicycle,

59
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,428
it has no gears.

60
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,680
One of the pedals is not there,

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,349
the brakes are not 100% working,

62
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,159
Sometimes I think,
if I could take a motorbike engine

63
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:08,188
and put it on my bicycle,

64
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,481
my life would be easier.

65
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,568
So with the help of Lectric E Bikes,
we were able to provide

66
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,322
Mr Barasa and 1000
other people with free electric bicycles.

67
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,823
You have made work easier!

68
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,116
It’s so easy to ride!

69
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,871
Darren and Dan then travelled to the Cure
Children's Hospital in the Philippines,

70
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,708
where we were able to provide
160 kids with life changing surgeries.

71
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,212
This little girl has just got her cast off
and she's learning to walk

72
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,756
for the first time
ever with her straight legs.

73
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,259
The magnitude of the surgeries

74
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,305
that these kids are getting from Cure
for free, will change their lives.

75
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,848
And the fact that Beast Philanthropy

76
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,894
can come in here and help Cure
provide care to some of these kids

77
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,898
is something that's going to affect me
and stay with me for the rest of my life.

78
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,276
The construction of the orphanage
in South Africa was now complete,

79
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,904
and it was time to surprise
Mama Rosie and the kids.

80
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,035
No!

81
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,932
Mama Rosie also told us about a boy
named Yamkela, who left the orphanage

82
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,143
14 years ago with
the dreams of becoming a musician.

83
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,383
However, he was struggling to make money
and practice his craft,

84
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:34,482
working full time at the airport.

85
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,443
It kills me
knowing that I'm doing something

86
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,446
that I'm not into,
and there is something that

87
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,158
I want to do that
I really love, but I cannot do it.

88
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,620
So we decided to surprise Yamkela
with a brand new top of the range

89
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,457
acoustic guitar as well as award him
a full scholarship to the best

90
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,585
music school in the country.

91
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,795
See you in a year.

92
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,672
The team then flew to Thailand,

93
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,301
a country with over 2 million
stray and disabled dogs,

94
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:06,222
to meet with Michael and help him rescue
as many dogs as possible.

95
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,890
Where we help thousands of dogs run

96
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,684
for the very first time,

97
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,118
As well as give Michael
a brand new rescue van,

98
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,580
state of the art gas machine
and a brand new ambulance.

99
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,498
Really happy.

100
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,499
Thank you very much.

101
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,961
Darren then received this video from a
TikToker named Dora moono.

102
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,296
Beast Philanthropy,

103
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,631
please please help me save our village,

104
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,383
our kids need you.

105
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,760
So Darren immediately

106
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,805
flew to Dora’s sanctuary in Zambia,
which had absolutely no electricity

107
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:51,684
and is located in a dangerous area
with high rates of domestic violence.

108
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,978
It became evident
that the lack of electricity

109
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,565
was holding them back
and severely curtailing Dora’s ability

110
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,985
to help develop this village
to what its potential could be.

111
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,863
Having to wake up thinking,
what will these kids eat?

112
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,450
That is still very difficult
to do each and every day.

113
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,161
So we came up with a plan
to use the direct sunlight

114
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,956
and scorching heat to our advantage
by installing a massive solar grid

115
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,418
that will provide electricity
to the entire village.

116
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,629
It was then time to turn on the lights
and the kids

117
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,672
couldn't contain their excitement.

118
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,466
Mateo, turn on the lights!

119
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,267
And we have lights!

120
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,857
We then found out about a college kid
in Philadelphia that is rescuing

121
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,277
thousands of pounds of food every month
because of his school meal swipes.

122
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,358
I originally started
just as a student with

123
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:47,657
leftover meal swipes
in my dining account,

124
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,451
and I realized as I was getting close
to the end of the term,

125
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:54,080
I have 50 meals left that I know
I'm not going to be able to use, and

126
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,375
I just had a pit in my stomach thinking
about all those meals going to waste.

127
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,586
So Darren flew there to meet him
and help expand his operation

128
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,130
to a national scale.

129
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,386
After witnessing everything
that Evan had done to help this community,

130
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,303
it didn't take but

131
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,682
an hour to know that we had committed
to partnering with Sharing Excess,

132
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,894
to help them achieve their goal of feeding
as many people as possible.

133
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:20,189
And with our help, Sharing Excess
were able to open an operation at

134
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,076
Hunts Point Produce
Market, the largest

135
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,610
produce market in the
world in New York City.

136
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,695
And that operation

137
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,990
is going to be three times larger
than the one that we have in Philly.

138
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,617
Next, Darren and Dan
travelled to the heart of Cameroon,

139
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,246
where thousands of children at this school
have to share a single toilet

140
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,374
and have lessons in these derelict
and dilapidated classrooms.

141
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,710
These conditions had no dignity.

142
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,213
These conditions would not make a child
believe that the future is bright.

143
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,716
Once we saw this,
we knew we had to do something.

144
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,094
So almost immediately
we started drawing up plans to begin

145
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:54,182
construction, and a few months later,
the brand new classrooms were built.

146
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,643
Just in time to surprise the kids
before they return from their holidays.

147
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,620
Lastly, we flew to Nepal

148
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,414
for a secret project
that will be revealed next year.

149
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:22,627
But on that mission, Dan and Darren
went to 21,000 feet high to Mount Everest,

150
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,631
to sign out this video where the altitude
made Dan very loopy.

151
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,591
Darren and I,

152
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:32,678
are at the highest point
we've ever been together.

153
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,305
It's been one hell of a year.

154
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:38,976
You know, we've been working together
just one year and look where we are

155
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:43,064
on top of the world,
literally and figuratively.

156
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,275
And I wouldn’t share this experience
with anybody else man.

157
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,112
Send this to any billionaires you know,
and tell them to stop buying

158
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,847
cars and instead help people.

159
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:53,155
IT'S BEEN SUCH AN
INCREDIBLE YEAR,

160
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:54,479
AND WE'VE HELPED SO MANY
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD

161
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:56,955
BUT NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
WITHOUT YOU.

162
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,151
YOU ARE THE HEART AND
SOUL OF BEAST PHILANTHROPY

163
00:08:58,176 --> 00:08:59,424
AND WE ARE BEYOND GRATEFUL
FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT.

164
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:02,182
HUGE LOVE, BEAST PHILANTHROPY.
