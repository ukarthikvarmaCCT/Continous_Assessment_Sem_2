00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,229
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:03,819
Is democracy over in our country?

3
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:05,388
This is a very serious question.

4
00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:07,693
Many of you will have a 
simple answer to this question:

5
00:00:07,693 --> 00:00:09,004
Obviously not.

6
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:11,852
We can vote for any political party we want.

7
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:14,242
The politician who gets the most votes,

8
00:00:14,242 --> 00:00:15,243
comes in power,

9
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:17,386
so obviously democracy still exists in our country.

10
00:00:17,386 --> 00:00:20,308
But this question is much deeper than that.

11
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:23,076
The things that I am going to 
show you in this video today

12
00:00:23,076 --> 00:00:24,669
will be very shocking.

13
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:27,492
After watching this video, you will be forced to think

14
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:30,231
about the real answer to this question.

15
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:32,927
Although, if you are someone

16
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:35,325
that considers PM Modi to be a god,

17
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:36,627
"He is our god.

18
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:37,792
We worship him."

19
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:40,214
"Prime Minister Modi, 
he is God's incarnation to us.

20
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:41,917
He is not a normal human."

21
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:45,662
"This country's Prime Minister is the incarnation of Lord Vishnu."

22
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:46,896
"God incarnate." 

23
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:48,421
Or if you are someone 

24
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,847
who thinks that Modi's every action helps humanity,

25
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:54,904
if you're already in awe of PM Modi,

26
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:58,082
"Modi is my husband, 
my brother, my father, my teacher."

27
00:00:58,082 --> 00:00:59,389
"-Okay.
-What do you want to say?"

28
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:02,782
"Why do you feel like no one other than 
Modi or Yogi can bring development?" 

29
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:04,138
"I am in love with him."

30
00:01:04,138 --> 00:01:05,193
In such cases,

31
00:01:05,193 --> 00:01:06,596
it might be difficult for you

32
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:08,667
to open your eyes and look at the truth.

33
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,412
But for the rest of the viewers,

34
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:12,538
if you truly care about the country,

35
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:15,441
watching this video is immensely important.

36
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:17,508
It's not just about one incident,

37
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:19,448
but many such incidents

38
00:01:19,448 --> 00:01:20,819
that are happening one after the other,

39
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:23,413
for the past few months, 
for the past few years.

40
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:26,630
All those incidents point to one thing,

41
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,059
that our country is moving forward towards One Nation, One Party.

42
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:34,345
Eradicating the voice of the opposition from the media,

43
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,934
horse-trading of the MLA's,

44
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:38,246
the taking away power from the elected governments

45
00:01:38,246 --> 00:01:39,656
by making new laws.

46
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:42,475
Weaponisation of investigative agencies.

47
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:46,249
Pressuring and imprisoning 
opposition politicians through ED and CBI.

48
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:50,487
Interfering in state governments' work through governors.

49
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:53,400
Withholding funds from state governments.

50
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,777
Taking away the right of the citizens to protest.

51
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:57,194
And if someone protests,

52
00:01:57,194 --> 00:02:00,295
welcoming them with tear gas and rubber bullets.

53
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:03,667
Using electoral bonds to hide their funding.

54
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:06,599
And even if an opposition candidate manages to win the election,

55
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,336
then committing election fraud 
to declare themselves the winner.

56
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:12,152
I would like to tell PM Modi,

57
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:13,674
"Have some decency!"

58
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,621
Before talking about democracy, friends,

59
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:26,596
it is important to know what democracy actually is.

60
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:28,415
It is a basic concept

61
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:32,581
but most people have a major 
misunderstanding of this concept.

62
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:33,842
Some people think that

63
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:35,764
if there are regular elections in the country

64
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,434
and you can go to vote,

65
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:39,445
then it means that the country is a democratic country.

66
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:40,772
But you know what?

67
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:43,073
Elections are held in North Korea too.

68
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:44,167
I am not kidding.

69
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:45,786
There are regular elections in North Korea.

70
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:48,637
You can also see 100% voter turnout in those elections.

71
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:49,714
But the only difference is that

72
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:53,458
if you do not vote for the official candidate elected by the government,

73
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,353
you are considered anti-national.

74
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:57,934
Your job can be snatched away,

75
00:02:57,934 --> 00:02:59,829
your house can be snatched away.

76
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:02,386
And if it's just about the word democracy,

77
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:04,777
then the official name of North Korea,

78
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:06,691
the word democracy is included in it.

79
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:10,290
North Korea is called the DPRK by their government.

80
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,873
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

81
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:14,185
But what is the truth?

82
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:16,431
This country is a dictatorship.

83
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:20,032
Similarly, Russia is also considered a dictatorship.

84
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:21,493
But elections are held there too.

85
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,292
The only difference is that any candidate 
who competes against Putin

86
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:27,986
is sometimes disqualified for some reason,

87
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:29,804
or sometimes k!lled mysteriously.

88
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,931
So, one thing should be clear from this

89
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:36,371
merely having elections does not mean

90
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:37,505
that the country is a democracy.

91
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:40,432
Elections need to be free and fair.

92
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:42,513
Free means that the people have freedom

93
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,264
to vote for whom they want to

94
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:45,558
and Fair means that

95
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,585
different candidates and different political parties

96
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:51,397
have a fair chance of winning.

97
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:55,105
It shouldn't be that one party has a lot of advantages.

98
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:58,250
Recently, the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation held its Mayor elections.

99
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,367
For this election, Congress and the AAP had formed an alliance,

100
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:05,997
and had a total of 20 votes out of 35.

101
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:08,206
It was clear by the party votes that

102
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,111
this alliance would win the elections.

103
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:12,182
But when the elections actually took place,

104
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:14,379
what did the presiding officer do?

105
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,188
This is not a secret.

106
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:18,749
You can see the CCTV footage of what he did.

107
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:22,553
He declared 8 Congress and AAP  votes as invalid.

108
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,849
And this election fraud that took place here,

109
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,408
was captured in the CCTV camera.

110
00:04:27,408 --> 00:04:30,055
In fact, he was caught looking at the camera too.

111
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:31,336
Look at his face.

112
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:32,883
The way he is looking at the camera,

113
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:35,049
it looks like he was caught stealing.

114
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:36,620
And what was the result of the election?

115
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,105
BJP claimed to have won this election.

116
00:04:39,105 --> 00:04:40,887
Such an open election fraud

117
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:43,217
has probably never happened in the country before.

118
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:45,220
The Chief Justice of India said that

119
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,849
this is a m*rder of democracy.

120
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:50,793
Although in a historic decision, the Supreme Court

121
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:52,303
had to save this election,

122
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:53,661
the question is,

123
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,566
if there were no CCTV cameras here

124
00:04:55,566 --> 00:04:57,028
or ballot papers,

125
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:58,944
would this fraud have been caught?

126
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:00,402
This is just one example, friends.

127
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:02,694
Before that, look at this news from 2021.

128
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:06,855
An EVM machine was found in a BJP candidate's car in Assam.

129
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:10,974
After this, the Election Commission had to order a repoll in this place.

130
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:13,078
But no need to talk about old news.

131
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:14,867
Look at this month's news.

132
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:16,619
February 2024.

133
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:20,236
Three unknown people went to the Saswad Tehsil office in Pune

134
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,558
to steal the control unit of the electronic voting machine.

135
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:24,914
Is this a joke?

136
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:28,563
Are our elections being conducted in a free and fair manner?

137
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:30,949
The Election Commission is an organisation

138
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:35,359
which is expected to conduct free and fair elections across the country.

139
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,965
But the Election Commission has been accused

140
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:40,273
of being partial and biased.

141
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,699
This accusation is very old.

142
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,669
Initially, BJP politician Narendra Modi had made this accusation.

143
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:46,904
You heard it right.

144
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:49,003
Before the May 2014 election,

145
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:51,519
Narendra Modi accused the Election Commission.

146
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,858
Although he won later elections.

147
00:05:54,858 --> 00:05:56,654
But in the last 10 years,

148
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:59,209
the Election Commission has been accused so much that

149
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,689
Prashant Kishore said that

150
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:04,718
the Election Commission is an extension of BJP.

151
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:09,711
He says that he has never seen such a 
partial and biased Election Commission.

152
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:12,804
That this Commission has always tried to bend the rules.

153
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:16,350
And tried to make the schedule of elections in such a way that

154
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,706
BJP always benefits.

155
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:20,784
The Election Commission has given very clear directions

156
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:24,844
that the Indian Army cannot be mentioned during political campaigns. 

157
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:28,079
But before the 2019 elections, PM Modi,

158
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,064
shamelessly asked for votes

159
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:33,461
using the martyrs and airstrikes.

160
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:36,776
"I want to ask my first-time voters that

161
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:46,591
can your vote be dedicated to 
the brave martyrs in Pulwama?"

162
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:49,866
Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Adityanath, went on to

163
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:53,062
call the Indian Army as Modi's Army.

164
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:58,376
"And Modi's army sh**ts the terr0rists."

165
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,531
When a complaint was filed with the 
Election Commission regarding this,

166
00:07:01,531 --> 00:07:03,933
no action was taken for 21 days.

167
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:07,365
And after 21 days, the Election Commission gave its clean chit.

168
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:09,145
The rules are clearly written,

169
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:10,483
they are being openly violated

170
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:11,825
but still a clean chit.

171
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:13,125
It's not the only clean chit,

172
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,670
PM Modi has got such clean chits in at least 4 different cases.

173
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,785
Amit Shah compared Rahul Gandhi's constituency with Pakistan.

174
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:22,699
This is also against the rules.

175
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:25,010
But the Election Commission has given clean chits in this too.

176
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,219
In total, there are 7 such cases

177
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:29,659
in which Modi and Shah have received clean chits.

178
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,507
NDTV had also reported that

179
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:34,487
one out of three election commissioners,

180
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,551
had a dissenting opinion 

181
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:38,188
in 5 out of the 7 cases.

182
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:39,955
It means that there was an election commissioner

183
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:42,544
who believed that they should not be given clean chits.

184
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:46,127
Later, it was found that the name of this 
election commissioner was Ashok Lavasa.

185
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:48,044
Do you know what happened to him later?

186
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:53,021
His wife, son, daughter, and sister all got 
notices from the government agencies.

187
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:56,051
The Citizen Commission on Elections in their report stated that

188
00:07:56,051 --> 00:07:59,887
Ashok Lavasa was silently removed from the election commission.

189
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:02,777
Just think, this is an election commissioner,

190
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:04,705
is this a democracy or a dictatorship?

191
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:06,801
In a democracy, separation of powers,

192
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,617
independence of institutions,

193
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:10,968
is something you must have read about in school.

194
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:13,667
Our Supreme Court had given an order

195
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,975
to strengthen the independence of the election commission.

196
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:20,238
To have the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners

197
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:23,506
be appointed by a three-member committee.

198
00:08:23,506 --> 00:08:25,729
One of whom will be the Prime Minister,

199
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:27,262
the other will be the opposition leader

200
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:29,686
and the third will be the Chief Justice of India.

201
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:31,430
By doing this, it could be ensured that

202
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,491
the Election Commissioner who is being appointed

203
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:35,639
will be truly independent.

204
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,414
There will be no bias towards any entity.

205
00:08:37,414 --> 00:08:38,714
But a few months ago,

206
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:40,532
the government brought in a new law

207
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:41,994
in which the government said that

208
00:08:41,994 --> 00:08:43,841
the Chief Justice of India would be removed from this committee.

209
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:46,815
Instead, they added their minister to the committee.

210
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:47,908
So, in three-member committee,

211
00:08:47,908 --> 00:08:49,914
two of them will be from the government

212
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:51,910
to appoint the Election Commissioner.

213
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,707
If BJP's intentions were clear,

214
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,544
then why was such a law passed?

215
00:08:55,544 --> 00:09:00,525
Why does the government want to control 
the appointment of the Election Commissioner?

216
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:03,108
This was later challenged in the Supreme Court,

217
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:05,200
but the Supreme Court did not take any action here,

218
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,024
saying that this falls under the separation of powers.

219
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:09,635
If the government is making a law,

220
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:12,463
then the Supreme Court does not want to strike it.

221
00:09:12,463 --> 00:09:15,051
Even today, the Election Commission has set a limit on

222
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:18,769
how much money can be spent on an MLA election and an MP election.

223
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:22,094
In an MP election, the limit is ₹9.5 million.

224
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,012
BJP contested the election on 437 seats.

225
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:26,794
So, the total spending of the party

226
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:29,236
should not have been more than ₹4.15 billion.

227
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,141
But how much did they spend? 

228
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:33,824
It is written on the website of the Election Commission,

229
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,782
₹12.64 billion.

230
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:39,142
how did the Election Commission allow this?

231
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:41,520
The Center for Media Studies also estimated that

232
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,450
BJP had spent ₹270 billion in the previous elections.

233
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,678
Which was 45% of the total expenditure.

234
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:50,740
If you look at the data of today,

235
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,272
electoral bonds worth ₹160 billion have been sold.

236
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:57,324
Out of these ₹160 billion, 
more than ₹100 billion went to BJP,

237
00:09:57,324 --> 00:09:59,696
₹15 billion to Congress

238
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,053
and ₹8 billion to TMC.

239
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:04,248
All these amounts surpass the spending limit of the election.

240
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:06,387
BJP leader Uma Bharti once said,

241
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:10,196
"Elections are a choice between bad and worse."

242
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:11,617
Which is true.

243
00:10:11,617 --> 00:10:13,329
But think about it.

244
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:17,476
If a social worker who has dedicated his life to serving people,

245
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:20,082
how will he be able to bring ₹9 million to contest an election?

246
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:22,899
How will he be able to promote himself?

247
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:26,597
Especially when on the other side, 
the party has billions of rupees.

248
00:10:26,597 --> 00:10:28,254
The problem isn't limited to elections.

249
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,847
Even if an opposition party forms the government,

250
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:33,021
the government is then broken apart.

251
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:37,173
Here, countless allegations have been 
levied against the BJP for horse-trading.

252
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:39,029
People have repeatedly accused BJP

253
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:41,469
of taking MLAs to some resort

254
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:44,642
and buying them with an unimaginable amount of money.

255
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:47,433
Are these allegations of horse trading true?

256
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,646
I cannot tell you because

257
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:51,536
I have never been to that resort.

258
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:52,795
But you can imagine,

259
00:10:52,795 --> 00:10:55,854
all those MLAs in the resort won't be merely playing Ludo.

260
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:59,456
Investigative agencies are responsible 
for investigating such allegations.

261
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:01,158
But if all the investigative agencies

262
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:03,425
dance to the tune of a single political party,

263
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:06,321
then who will investigate these allegations?

264
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:08,934
Now imagine what would be going on in the MLAs' homes.

265
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,476
The politician who buys these MLAs,

266
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,021
what would he say to his family?

267
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:17,318
Proudly telling them the good news

268
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:19,142
that he suppressed the voice of the people.

269
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:21,209
That he str@ngled democracy.

270
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:22,543
Hoping to be praised.

271
00:11:22,543 --> 00:11:26,073
And the other MLA, who sold his soul for some money,

272
00:11:26,073 --> 00:11:27,963
what would he tell his family?

273
00:11:27,963 --> 00:11:30,793
Proudly showing the money he brought in.

274
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:34,719
By maligning the integrity of the nation by falling for horse-trading.

275
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:35,807
Celebrating his lack of integrity.

276
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,470
It's easy to get angry at such politicians,

277
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,936
but they're pitiful too.

278
00:11:38,936 --> 00:11:40,260
How miserable they are,

279
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,409
how low they have fallen.

280
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,035
Horse-trading and luring politicians with money is just one way.

281
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:46,885
If an MLA doesn't fall for this,

282
00:11:46,885 --> 00:11:50,168
the second way is to use the investigative agencies.

283
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,492
Using ED,

284
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:52,934
weaponisation of ED.

285
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:56,136
Last year 14 political parties had 
complained to the Supreme Court

286
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:59,714
about how the government is using CBI and ED

287
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:01,515
against opposition leaders.

288
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:05,234
They said that they have carried out 
more than 3,000 raids on political leaders.

289
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:07,729
If you compare it with 2014,

290
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:11,960
you can see a 4 fold jump in the number of ED cases against politicians.

291
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,994
And 95% of the cases are registered against opposition parties.

292
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:18,846
In response, ED said that their conviction rate is very high.

293
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:20,138
The conviction rate is 96%

294
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:23,281
because the trials in 25 cases are over

295
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:25,915
and there was a conviction in 24 cases.

296
00:12:25,915 --> 00:12:29,238
But the truth is that from 2005 till now,

297
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:33,304
ED has registered more than 5,900 cases.

298
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:35,900
The trial was conducted in only 25 cases.

299
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,923
And the conviction was in only 24 cases.

300
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:42,288
That translates to only 0.5% of the cases being substantial.

301
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:45,343
Whenever an opposition politician is accused of corruption

302
00:12:45,343 --> 00:12:47,105
and he joins BJP,

303
00:12:47,105 --> 00:12:48,841
all charges vanish suddenly.

304
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:51,130
All cases against him are dropped.

305
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,981
Someone had even written a poem on him.

306
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,810
*Washing Powder Modi*

307
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,430
*lies and frauds*

308
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,964
*it hides everything*

309
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:03,829
*even serious allegations disappear in a blink*

310
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,678
When Himanta Biswa Sharma was in Congress,

311
00:13:06,678 --> 00:13:09,231
he was accused in the Saradha Chit Fund Scam.

312
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:12,475
CBI called him for questioning in November 2014.

313
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:15,081
And since 2015, when he joined BJP,

314
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:18,369
7 more allegations of corruption have been filed against him.

315
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:20,988
One allegation is about a land scam,

316
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:24,633
another allegation is that he is running 
syndicates in the silk and muga industry.

317
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,545
But since he joined BJP,

318
00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:28,940
there have been no investigations on him.

319
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,253
By the way, the list of politicians who 
went in BJP's washing machine is very long.

320
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:45,067
Many of these politicians were previously 
mentioned by PM Narendra Modi in his speeches

321
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,963
as examples of corruption.

322
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:50,283
Calling NCP the Naturally Corrupt Party, 
and asking people to never vote for them.

323
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:52,980
But as soon as these leaders joined BJP,

324
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,658
the investigations stopped

325
00:13:54,658 --> 00:13:56,895
and the corruption scams were forgotten.

326
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:59,338
BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee had once said

327
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,291
where someone has to rely on corrupt individuals to gain power,

328
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,627
he said that he wouldn't want to get near that power.

329
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:08,856
"If I get power,

330
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:12,629
I don't even want to touch such power with a tong."

331
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,311
But that era was completely different.

332
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:17,086
That BJP and today's BJP,

333
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:18,930
are vastly different.

334
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,978
Today when Nitin Ghatkari is asked about Modi's washing powder,

335
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:25,381
he answers with a smile that

336
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:27,965
BJP's detergent is eco-friendly.

337
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:29,696
It's important to win in elections,

338
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:31,682
and the winner decides what's right or wrong.

339
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:35,721
"BJP's soap is washing away everyone's scandals in a washing machine."

340
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,328
"It's an eco-friendly detergent."

341
00:14:38,617 --> 00:14:40,682
Whom do you agree with more?

342
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:42,326
Present-day Nitin Gadkari

343
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:45,177
or the former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee?

344
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:46,560
Comments below.

345
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,615
Even despite the lure of money 
and the pressure of ED,

346
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:51,767
if an opposition politician doesn't join BJP,

347
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,990
the proceedings against them continue.

348
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,809
And in many cases,

349
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:58,868
they are put in jail without being convicted.

350
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:00,941
And they remain in jail for many months.

351
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,408
AAP MP Raghav Chadda said that

352
00:15:03,408 --> 00:15:07,153
if Manish Sisodia, Satyendra Jain, Abhishek Banerjee, Sanjay Raut,

353
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:10,592
Farooq Abdullah, and Tejashwi Yadav join BJP,

354
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:14,189
all the cases by ED and CBI against them

355
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:15,804
will be dismissed immediately.

356
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:18,897
And people like Manish Sisodia, and Satyendra Jain who are in jail

357
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,213
will be released immediately.

358
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:24,239
Now, to imprison someone after a conviction is a different matter.

359
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:29,584
But here, opposition politicians are being 
sent to jail before they are convicted.

360
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:33,360
The worst thing is that in the states where opposition governments exist,

361
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,741
they are not allowed to work there.

362
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:38,562
Not just one or two, but many states have

363
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,404
repeatedly accused the Modi government that

364
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:45,970
they are using governors to interfere in the state's day-to-day affairs.

365
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,305
They are preventing the state governments from working.

366
00:15:48,305 --> 00:15:50,281
The West Bengal government has said this.

367
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:53,301
The West Bengal governor has been repeatedly blamed for this.

368
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:54,722
The Tamil Nadu government has said this.

369
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:56,619
The Delhi government has said this.

370
00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:58,513
The Kerala government has said this.

371
00:15:58,513 --> 00:16:00,948
Last year, the Kerala government even accused the governor

372
00:16:00,948 --> 00:16:05,648
of delaying the bills passed by the state government for 2 years.

373
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:07,588
Delaying the bill's approval.

374
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:10,446
The state of Kerala even complained to the Supreme Court about this.

375
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:14,520
The Supreme Court said that the governors cannot delay bills like this.

376
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,327
That this is unconstitutional.

377
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:19,337
The issue between the LG and the Delhi government in Delhi

378
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:21,683
has been in the news for many years.

379
00:16:21,962 --> 00:16:24,831
Over the last few years, 
CM Kejriwal has repeatedly said that

380
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,570
they are not allowed to work.

381
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,199
The LG interferes in their work.

382
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,083
The Delhi government approached the Supreme Court for this

383
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,513
and the Supreme Court's decision was in their favour.

384
00:16:34,513 --> 00:16:36,354
The Supreme Court stated that

385
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:38,479
LG should not interfere in this way.

386
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,872
The real power should be in the hands of the elected government.

387
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:43,910
But what did the Central Government do 
after the Supreme Court's decision?

388
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,371
They brought a new law

389
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,467
to take away the powers of the Delhi government.

390
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:48,708
GNCTD,

391
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,871
Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2023.

392
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:54,515
The Modi government used this

393
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:59,115
to transfer many powers vested with 
the Delhi government to the LG.

394
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:00,872
"We changed the hospitals.

395
00:17:00,872 --> 00:17:02,538
We made them grand.

396
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:04,614
We arranged for all the medicines.

397
00:17:04,614 --> 00:17:10,592
They forced the officers to disrupt the flow of medicines.

398
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:11,845
They stopped the tests.

399
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:16,343
Last year, for three months, no tests could be run in the mobile clinics.

400
00:17:16,343 --> 00:17:18,117
They stopped the payments to the laboratories.

401
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:20,965
They play dirty and are disgusting people.

402
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:22,720
By passing one order one day,

403
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,119
they removed the data entry operator 
in all the government hospitals in Delhi.

404
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:29,652
Now there is no one left to register patients in the hospitals.

405
00:17:29,652 --> 00:17:31,919
I ask them, what do you want to do?

406
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,259
Do you want to k!ll the people of Delhi?"

407
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:36,172
Think about it yourself, friends.

408
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:37,558
Even if you are a Modi fan, 

409
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,702
forget about him for a second

410
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:43,633
and ask yourself sincerely.

411
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:46,790
If PM Modi was really worried about the country,

412
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,768
the people of the country,

413
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,590
would he have done such things?

414
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,397
Now some of you will think that

415
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:56,150
surely some opposition party has funded me to make this video.

416
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,874
But I am telling you the truth,

417
00:17:57,874 --> 00:17:59,752
no political party has funded me.

418
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:01,331
The things that I am showing you in this video

419
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,963
represents the reality of the country.

420
00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:04,831
If you are really concerned about the country,

421
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:07,528
then you should open your eyes after seeing these things.

422
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:10,192
News Laundry revealed an investigation report two days ago

423
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:13,086
that shows ED is used not only against other political parties,

424
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:15,786
but also against companies in the country.

425
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:18,085
At least 23 such companies which

426
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:20,572
hadn't donated any money to BJP yet.

427
00:18:20,572 --> 00:18:22,928
Central agencies raid their premises

428
00:18:22,928 --> 00:18:24,620
and a pattern emerges.

429
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,297
After the raid, those companies donated millions of rupees to BJP.

430
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:32,220
In total, these companies donated ₹3.35 billion to BJP,

431
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,697
which were subjected to IT or ED raid.

432
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:38,164
So, were these companies threatened to extort money?

433
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:41,464
Are our elections held in a free and fair manner?

434
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:44,276
Here, the media also plays an important role too.

435
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:48,175
Fair elections mean that the politicians of 
the ruling party and the opposition

436
00:18:48,175 --> 00:18:50,973
are given an equal chance to speak.

437
00:18:50,973 --> 00:18:54,940
Both get more or less equal media coverage.

438
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,399
But what do we see in the media?

439
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:01,492
Day and night, 24*7, the media sings praises the government. 

440
00:19:01,492 --> 00:19:03,357
They praise the ruling party.

441
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:05,520
Or repeat their talking points.

442
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,713
"Every mother in the country wants her son to be like PM Modi.

443
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:14,206
and every son wants to be like Narendra Modi."

444
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:16,964
"Modi has the solution to everything."

445
00:19:16,964 --> 00:19:18,406
"There's no one like PM Modi."

446
00:19:18,406 --> 00:19:20,838
"Modi built the New India."

447
00:19:20,838 --> 00:19:21,927
"PM #1"

448
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,330
Opposition parties may go on a Bharat Jodo Yatra,

449
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,718
to make promises to the government.

450
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:30,557
There was a time when on Doordarshan 

451
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:33,304
the politicians of the ruling party and the opposition party,

452
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:36,389
debated on important issues before the election on the news channel.

453
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:38,995
Both had the right to defend their stance.

454
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:41,240
Can today Doordarshan do this?

455
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,985
Today, the BJP spokesperson doesn't even need to speak

456
00:19:43,985 --> 00:19:47,303
because TV anchors have become BJP spokespersons.

457
00:19:47,303 --> 00:19:49,689
Instead of questioning the government on behalf of the people,

458
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,715
they defend the government.

459
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:53,112
And they defend the government to an extent that

460
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:56,201
they might start to hold the youth 
responsible for increasing unemployment.

461
00:19:56,201 --> 00:19:59,489
And if you have elected an opposition party in the elections,

462
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,567
then they will start insulting the people.

463
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,472
"And the people have turned away 
from the national issues and BJP.

464
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:08,102
They choose to vote based on 

465
00:20:08,102 --> 00:20:11,096
which party will give them free stuff."

466
00:20:11,096 --> 00:20:12,904
NDTV was the last TV channel

467
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:15,816
which dared to question the government.

468
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:20,242
Ultimately, NDTV was taken over by PM Modi's friend, Gautam Adani.

469
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:23,992
Today, TV news has d!ed a silent de@th in our country.

470
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:26,023
The government uses tax money to

471
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:29,901
give huge amounts of money to these TV 
channels for running 'advertisements'

472
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:33,321
and these TV channels work to suppress the voices of the citizens.

473
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:35,450
If the real news doesn't reach you,

474
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,665
will you be able to decide freely and fairly who to vote for?

475
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:42,094
Manipur was set ablaze for 77 days,

476
00:20:42,094 --> 00:20:44,515
but there were no special reports on TV channels.

477
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:47,007
Recently, the CAG of India presented 12 reports,

478
00:20:47,007 --> 00:20:49,672
which had a lot of irregularities

479
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:52,227
and instances of corruption

480
00:20:52,227 --> 00:20:54,734
in government departments and ministries.

481
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:57,062
Under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, 
more than 900,000 people

482
00:20:57,062 --> 00:20:59,065
were using only 3 mobile numbers.

483
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:03,284
Millions of rupees were spent on the treatment of 3,400 patients

484
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:06,018
who were already declared dead.

485
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:08,144
When this CAG report came out,

486
00:21:08,144 --> 00:21:11,444
the government transferred the CAG officers.

487
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,129
Have you heard this news on TV channels?

488
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:14,109
You haven't.

489
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,439
How will it reach you?

490
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:17,401
The second misunderstanding that people have is

491
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,534
they confuse democracy with majoritarianism.

492
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:23,956
Imagine that you are travelling in a car with 5 people.

493
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:28,918
One person in the car says that he wants to listen to loud music.

494
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:31,289
He convinces his friend and the driver

495
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,419
that they should play loud music in the car.

496
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:37,195
But you are travelling with your father who has a heart problem.

497
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:39,799
You say that loud music should not be played.

498
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,404
That person says, that all of you should 
vote to prove that it's a democracy.

499
00:21:42,822 --> 00:21:45,651
And three people voted that loud music should be played.

500
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:48,064
Your father and you, are the two people, 
who say that loud music shouldn't be played.

501
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:51,225
Since the majority voted to play loud music

502
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:55,077
in a democracy, it would mean that loud music will be played in the car.

503
00:21:55,077 --> 00:21:57,101
Is this really democracy?

504
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:58,823
No, this is stupidity.

505
00:21:58,823 --> 00:22:01,733
To give you a small-scale example in real life,

506
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:05,247
then look at this circular from a society in Gurgaon.

507
00:22:05,247 --> 00:22:07,462
"Dear Residents,
This is to inform you that

508
00:22:07,462 --> 00:22:09,855
two wheeler not permitted inside our society

509
00:22:09,855 --> 00:22:11,633
as per decision of the management."

510
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:13,943
It means that only cars will enter the society,

511
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:15,788
scooters and motorcycles cannot.

512
00:22:15,788 --> 00:22:17,850
Look at the unabashed discrimination.

513
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,985
The management, the RWAs,

514
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:22,014
have been elected by the people.

515
00:22:22,014 --> 00:22:24,419
So even if you don't like this rule, you would need to keep quiet.

516
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,558
Because the majority has consented to this,

517
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:28,512
they have elected the RWLO.

518
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:31,746
People who confuse democracy and majoritarianism,

519
00:22:31,746 --> 00:22:33,379
must be thinking this.

520
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:34,852
This is not just about one society,

521
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:36,896
there are many such societies all over the country

522
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:39,791
where you will find such stupid rules if not stupider.

523
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,572
Look at this article from 2019.

524
00:22:41,572 --> 00:22:45,904
A bank employee is saying that her sister didn't get an apartment on rent.

525
00:22:45,904 --> 00:22:48,470
Because many RWOs blacklisted her

526
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,546
just because her sister was an air hostess.

527
00:22:51,546 --> 00:22:54,944
Some societies say that they can't rent an apartment to an air hostess

528
00:22:54,944 --> 00:22:57,948
because of their odd work timings.

529
00:22:57,948 --> 00:23:00,797
Often, these RWAs make up any baseless rule they want to.

530
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:02,688
For example, in some societies in Noida,

531
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:04,785
entry and exit fees have been imposed.

532
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:07,862
Anyone who wants to rent an apartment in these societies,

533
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:09,522
will have to pay an entry fee.

534
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:13,122
And they will, of course, be required to pay the rent to the landlord,

535
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:14,985
but when they leave the society,

536
00:23:14,985 --> 00:23:16,299
they have to pay an exit fee.

537
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:19,540
The majoritarianism at the local level in the country,

538
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:24,970
Some people think this about politicians and governments.

539
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,176
Once the politicians are elected and they are in power,

540
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:31,147
they can make any rule they want.

541
00:23:31,147 --> 00:23:32,741
On the Preamble to our Constitution,

542
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:34,864
4 words are clearly written

543
00:23:34,864 --> 00:23:38,186
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, and Justice.

544
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,064
These 4 words are the cornerstones of democracy.

545
00:23:41,064 --> 00:23:43,846
In fact, Dr. Ambedkar went one step further.

546
00:23:43,846 --> 00:23:47,450
He said that these 4 words are the principles of life.

547
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,437
So, a majority vote doesn't mean that

548
00:23:49,437 --> 00:23:51,261
you can take away someone's natural rights,

549
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:54,441
discriminate against them or make nonsense rules.

550
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:58,328
This is why we can say that some of the decisions taken by the government

551
00:23:58,328 --> 00:24:00,005
go against democracy.

552
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:01,671
In the language of the Supreme Court,

553
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:03,465
they are unconstitutional.

554
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:05,002
Like just a few days ago,

555
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:07,834
the Supreme Court struck down the Electoral Bonds Scheme

556
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:10,186
calling it unconstitutional.

557
00:24:10,186 --> 00:24:13,006
The court said that the government had made an arbitrary rule.

558
00:24:13,006 --> 00:24:15,606
Why was this Electoral Bonds Scheme unconstitutional

559
00:24:15,606 --> 00:24:17,212
and against the welfare of the people?

560
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:19,587
I have talked about this in previous videos.

561
00:24:19,587 --> 00:24:21,655
So, it was a good step by the Supreme Court

562
00:24:21,655 --> 00:24:23,977
even though the decision was a bit late,

563
00:24:23,977 --> 00:24:25,744
but at least the took the right decision

564
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:27,418
in favour of democracy and the people.

565
00:24:27,418 --> 00:24:29,257
But holding the government accountable

566
00:24:29,257 --> 00:24:30,817
is not only the Supreme Court's responsibility,

567
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:32,184
but in a real democracy,

568
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:34,245
this is the job of the opposition,

569
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:37,732
media, civil society, and the citizens.

570
00:24:37,732 --> 00:24:39,024
And for this reason,

571
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:41,718
mechanisms like RTI, Right to Information Act, exits.

572
00:24:41,718 --> 00:24:44,605
Which gives us data about the government.

573
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:48,298
For the same reason, the media is called the fourth pillar of democracy,

574
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:49,991
so that it will hold the government accountable.

575
00:24:50,514 --> 00:24:52,188
But what is the situation today?

576
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:55,565
Till date, PM Modi has held zero press conferences

577
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:58,411
where unscripted questions have been asked.

578
00:24:58,411 --> 00:25:00,257
Accountability is at absolute zero.

579
00:25:00,257 --> 00:25:01,823
Forget the press conference,

580
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:04,762
he doesn't have the courage to face one unscripted question.

581
00:25:04,762 --> 00:25:06,397
When Dr Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister,

582
00:25:06,397 --> 00:25:11,481
he held press conferences or addressed the press at least 117 times.

583
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:15,268
The last time a proper press conference was held in our country

584
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:16,649
by the Prime Minister,

585
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:19,555
it has been more than 10 years since that day.

586
00:25:19,555 --> 00:25:20,907
In that last press conference,

587
00:25:20,907 --> 00:25:24,577
62 unscripted questions were asked to PM Dr Manmohan Singh

588
00:25:24,577 --> 00:25:27,066
with more than 100 journalists present.

589
00:25:27,414 --> 00:25:28,671
In a true democracy,

590
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:30,052
this accountability is the reason

591
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:33,579
which gives the citizens the right to protest.

592
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:35,691
If the managers elected by our country

593
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:38,252
are not interested in being held accountable under the RTI,

594
00:25:38,252 --> 00:25:40,533
aren't comfortable with being accountable to the media,

595
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:43,546
then they will have to be held accountable by the citizens.

596
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:46,914
A positive example of this was recently seen in UP

597
00:25:46,914 --> 00:25:51,123
when the UP government made a very strange and undemocratic rule.

598
00:25:51,123 --> 00:25:54,263
They issued guidelines for coaching centres

599
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:58,596
that they should not conduct classes for girls after 8 pm.

600
00:25:58,596 --> 00:26:01,876
If they do, action will be taken against them.

601
00:26:01,876 --> 00:26:03,949
And what was the government's justification?

602
00:26:03,949 --> 00:26:06,136
That it was necessary for the safety of girls.

603
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:07,950
But does this make any sense?

604
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,785
Instead of controlling the ones who are a threat to girls,

605
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:11,686
instead of controlling the problematic elements,

606
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:13,501
they tried to put the girls in cages.

607
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:17,373
protested against these rules.

608
00:26:17,373 --> 00:26:18,767
And after the protest,

609
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:21,904
the UP government withdrew the ban.

610
00:26:21,904 --> 00:26:23,599
This small incident shows

611
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:26,264
the power of the people in a democracy.

612
00:26:26,264 --> 00:26:30,579
But what if the right to protest is taken away from people?

613
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:33,249
Recently, when farmers had to go back to the streets to protest again,

614
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:36,883
the government welcomed them with sharp nails.

615
00:26:37,231 --> 00:26:38,865
In some places, roads were dug

616
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:41,302
to completely block the roads.

617
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:43,589
Then rubber bullets were fired at the farmers,

618
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:47,342
tear gas was thrown at them, using drones.

619
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:48,870
As if this was a war zone.

620
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,266
The photos of the border crossing made it look like

621
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:54,628
this was the national border with China.

622
00:26:54,628 --> 00:26:56,561
Even there, there are no arrangements like this.

623
00:26:56,944 --> 00:26:58,452
And in the news, it is being reported that

624
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:00,853
at least 3 farmers went blind

625
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:03,826
because of the rubber bullets fired by the police.

626
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:05,675
We will talk about the reasons behind this protest

627
00:27:05,675 --> 00:27:07,074
and the demands of the farmers

628
00:27:07,074 --> 00:27:08,839
in a separate video.

629
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,152
But for now, this doesn't matter.

630
00:27:11,152 --> 00:27:12,628
The point here is that

631
00:27:12,628 --> 00:27:17,064
the government treating citizens peacefully protesting like this,

632
00:27:17,064 --> 00:27:18,125
Is this right?

633
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,592
Before this, there was the wrestlers' protest.

634
00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:21,777
The police behaved similarly back then too.

635
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:24,354
This was the case in the last farmer protest too.

636
00:27:24,354 --> 00:27:27,371
Numerous farmers lost their lives during the protest.

637
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,395
According to an article from 2021,

638
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:33,377
at least 600 farmers were killed in the last farmers' protest.

639
00:27:33,377 --> 00:27:36,523
And these are the protests that you get to hear about in the news

640
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:39,348
because these protests have gotten bigger than a certain limit.

641
00:27:39,348 --> 00:27:42,962
Apart from this, most of the protests that were held over the last few years

642
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:45,844
have never been talked about in the news.

643
00:27:45,844 --> 00:27:50,439
Did you know about Kashmiri Pandit's protests that lasted more than 40 days?

644
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:54,466
About the government employees protesting against the old pension scheme,?

645
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:57,716
Or the protest in Hisar that continued for more than 400 days?

646
00:27:57,716 --> 00:28:00,169
Against the closing of the Doordarshan Kendra,

647
00:28:00,518 --> 00:28:02,724
Or the doctors' protest last year,

648
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,376
or the protest by the unemployed youth.

649
00:28:05,376 --> 00:28:07,519
Don't delude yourself that this has nothing to do you,

650
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,125
since you are not taking part in these protests.

651
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:12,634
Because tomorrow, if you are subjected to any injustice,

652
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:15,201
if the government takes any decision

653
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:16,960
that goes against your rights.

654
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,836
And you go out to protest to defend your rights.

655
00:28:20,836 --> 00:28:22,531
What do you think?

656
00:28:22,531 --> 00:28:24,250
Won't you be treated the same way

657
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,746
these farmers are being treated today?

658
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,009
Are you special?

659
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:30,868
If the government is treating all the protesters this way,

660
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:33,218
then you won't get any special privilege.

661
00:28:33,218 --> 00:28:35,610
Now this question that I asked you at the beginning of the video,

662
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,663
I would like to ask again.

663
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:40,936
Is democracy still alive in the country today?

664
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:43,372
Whatever your answer may be,

665
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:44,709
but one thing is for sure,

666
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:47,202
if the situation continues to deteriorate this way,

667
00:28:47,202 --> 00:28:50,841
it will not take much time for us to fall 
to the levels of North Korea and Russia.

668
00:28:50,841 --> 00:28:53,147
Democracy will exist on paper,

669
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:54,717
elections will also be held,

670
00:28:54,717 --> 00:28:56,199
but in the real sense,

671
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:59,081
democracy will have breathed its last breath.

672
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:00,827
Thank you very much!
