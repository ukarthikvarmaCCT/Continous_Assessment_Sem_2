1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:03,139
I am from this wonderful
place called Odisha.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:05,902
And we are surrounded by
these f**k-all states -

3
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:13,862
West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh!

4
00:00:15,758 --> 00:00:16,861
It's like 3 people saying,

5
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:18,612
"Ab develop ho ke dikha!!!"

6
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:29,736
As you can see from my looks,

7
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:31,413
I am a really active guy!

8
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:34,863
I am so active that when I have to pee,

9
00:00:34,888 --> 00:00:36,688
I dont go to the bathroom.

10
00:00:36,992 --> 00:00:38,157
I travel!

11
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:42,362
It's an effort both
physically and mentally.

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,151
I don't move around much.

13
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:47,362
I move around so less that recently

14
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:48,639
I suffered from neck-sprain and

15
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:50,362
I didn't even feel the pain.

16
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:52,152
Coz mudu toh jaanu!

17
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:58,113
I don't learn from my
past mistakes because,

18
00:00:58,138 --> 00:01:00,362
koun mudke dekhe peechhe!

19
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:07,613
Dosto meri zindagi
ek tasveer hai,

20
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:09,652
kyuki mai hilta nahi.

21
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:18,862
Sun rises in the east
and sets in the west.

22
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:21,902
Not for me guys, mai
karwat hi nahi leta.

23
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:25,901
For me, sun rises in
the east and disappears.

24
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:32,653
People come up to me and say,

25
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:34,402
tu patla ho jayega na
toh mast dikhega!

26
00:01:35,337 --> 00:01:36,400
And the conviction man.....

27
00:01:36,486 --> 00:01:37,970
"Tu patla ho jayega
na toh mast dikhega!"

28
00:01:37,995 --> 00:01:38,613
I am like...

29
00:01:38,638 --> 00:01:40,902

30
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:43,152

00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,652
Mai imagine kar

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,652
Tere dikhne ke liye

33
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:49,265
thodi mai gym jau yaar!

34
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:54,335
People come up to me
in my office and say ki

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,435
"Aye abinash, tera ye
shirt ka button,pant

36
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,111

same line mei nahi hai"

37
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,152
Toh?????

38
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:02,864
Hota toh kya Aishwarya
ban jaata mai!

39
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:05,362
Tere ko achha nahi lagta

40
00:02:05,387 --> 00:02:06,612
toh tu ped se baat kar naa.

41
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:10,862
Tere ko pata hai naa...

42
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:11,903
extra effort lagta hai.....

43
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:12,921
dikhta nahi mujhe.....

44
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:15,114
mirror lagta hai

45
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,571
aur jab main theek karta hu

46
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,071
ab kya bolna hai

47
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,862
nahi ab toh kuch nahi
ab wahi bolna tha

48
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:22,362
people come up to me…

49
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:23,827
like my dad mostly

50
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,651
it's not people…

51
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:27,680
because who else
will come up to me

52
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,579
ki zindagi mein kuch kar!

53
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:32,904
Do something with your life!

54
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:36,862
Leave some footprints behind!

55
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:38,362
I'm like,"Aapko
mujhe dekhkar lagta

56
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:40,361
hai mere zyada
footprints honge?"

57
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:42,112
I think when i die,

58
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:43,864
I'll leave a lot of ass-prints

59
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:47,114
yeah, in abundance.

60
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,362
mere pote bolenge
yahi toh the dadaji

61
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,902
yahi gol chakki…baith baithke

62
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,652
itna bada ched kar diye hai

63
00:02:53,977 --> 00:02:55,611
and I have no problem in being fat

64
00:02:55,636 --> 00:02:56,402
and I am being very honest

65
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,009
no problem in being fat

66
00:02:58,126 --> 00:02:59,017
only one issue

67
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:01,652
If I die a fat person!

68
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:04,112
because I have never seen a fat ghost

69
00:03:07,161 --> 00:03:08,965
imagine main marr gaya

70
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:11,612
aur mera spirit iss
ladki ke andar ghus gaya

71
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,402
iska centre of gravity hil jaayega

72
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:17,153
aisa dhan dhan dhan

73
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,112
it'll not feel good

74
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,480
vertical snake

75
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:24,653
mujhe lagta hai agar
main mota rehke marr gaya

76
00:03:24,797 --> 00:03:25,863
toh yamraj aake bolega

77
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:26,113
main bhais pe jaaraha hu

78
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:27,361
tu jogging karke aa

79
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,153
And I'm not ready for that

80
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,705
But it's not like
I'm like this because

81
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:36,876
I'm not lazy because I'm fat

82
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:37,845
I don't think so

83
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:41,149
because blame dene ke
bahut saari cheezein hai

84
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,367
I'm from this wonderful
place called Odisha

85
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:46,211
Do any of you know Odisha?

86
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:47,362

00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,969
