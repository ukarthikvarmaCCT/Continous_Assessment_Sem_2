00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:06,198
'Madhupur, Uttar Pradesh.'

2
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:35,281
No...

3
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,269
'It's my wedding today.'

4
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:46,342
'I will have to part'

5
00:00:46,462 --> 00:00:48,923
from my fields, my land!

6
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:52,092
'No! That's not possible.'

7
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:10,208
"Nandini, the child of the soil."

8
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:19,209
"Nandini, the child of the soil."

9
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:31,150
Nobody can take me away from you.

10
00:01:31,847 --> 00:01:34,002
I shall never leave you.

11
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:40,798
Mother Earth, you need water.

12
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:42,112
I'll bring it right away.

13
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:55,824
Nandu, you're here?
It's your wedding today

14
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,438
and you're toiling in the fields!

15
00:01:57,558 --> 00:01:59,975
You're a bride-to-be
yet you can't leave the fields alone.

16
00:02:00,152 --> 00:02:02,102
Uncle, this soil is worth gold.

17
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,114
Every girl dreams of marriage.

18
00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:06,827
Likewise

19
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:09,116
farmers live for their lands.

20
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:12,199
When we touch this soil

21
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,360
let alone me

22
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,330
but the whole world benefits from it.

23
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:16,967
Do you get me?

24
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,097
Need I say more?

25
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:20,611
I'll leave now.

26
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:21,832
Listen up, everybody

27
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:24,177
be there on time for my wedding.

28
00:02:24,297 --> 00:02:26,409
Yes, dear, we'll be there.

29
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:32,843
Mother Earth, I need your blessings

30
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,288
so that I won't forget my village

31
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,748
once I leave for my marital home.

32
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:46,626
Let's go home, Shera.

33
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:51,128
Stop!

34
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:57,203
Why are you blocking my way?

35
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:10,596
Nandu, get down.

36
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:14,274
Your grandpa hasn't repaid

37
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:15,620
the loan he borrowed from me.

38
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:17,068
From now on

39
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:18,810
this tractor is mine.

40
00:03:23,844 --> 00:03:26,062
My grandpa and I never break promises.

41
00:03:26,388 --> 00:03:27,609
We'll clear your dues.

42
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:41,262
Don't you dare!

43
00:03:43,354 --> 00:03:45,539
Don't your dare touch Shera!

44
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:51,294
I told you, we'll clear your dues.

45
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,541
Do I look like a fool?

46
00:03:52,663 --> 00:03:54,599
You'll get married and leave.

47
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,332
How will you repay my loan?

48
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:57,459
So what?

49
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,539
I'm getting married, not dying!

50
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:01,911
I'll come here every day
after getting married.

51
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,591
My marital home isn't far.

52
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:05,793
It's close by

53
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,110
in Ayodhya, the land of Lord Ram.

54
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,617
'Ayodhya.'

55

Lord Ram, when You returned to Ayodhya

I'm sure, Your mother, Kaushalya

62
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:52,104
was as anxious

63
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:55,012
as I am today.

64
00:04:55,738 --> 00:04:58,159
My grandson, Akash

65
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,588
my dear boy

66
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,710
is returning from New York.

67
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,903
I am brimming with joy

68
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,431
and endless hopes.

69
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,972
Dear Lord

70
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,531
shower us with Your blessings.

71
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:20,219
Give the holy offering to everyone.

72
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:24,264
Pack some for Akash.

73
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:25,489
Yes, ma'am.

74
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,933
Hello, Mr Dubey.

75
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:28,900
Everything should be well organised.

76
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,220
I'm leaving it to you.

77
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:33,965
A new chapter of Bharadwaj Industries
begins tomorrow.

78
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:38,974
New chapter?

79
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:43,503
What is she planning for tomorrow?

80
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,707
I've invited eminent people
from across the city.

81
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,683
In their presence

82
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:55,326
I shall announce the successor
of Bharadwaj Industries.

83
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,491
Things better go well, Mr Dubey.

84
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:05,788
Poor Aunt!

85
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:10,771
She's planning a coronation of sorts
in Ayodhya tomorrow!

86
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,676
She has no clue

87
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:18,048
how I'll throttle her plans.

88
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:21,239
Sorry, Aunt.

89
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:23,316
It was a huge mistake

90
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:27,510
that Kamya overheard you.

91
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:31,341
Kamya won't sit still.

92
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:34,154
That's great!

93
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:38,309
You'll look better than your
sister-in-law, Imarti Bharadwaj.

94
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:41,109
By God

95
00:06:41,362 --> 00:06:43,244
I'll look stylish!

96
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:46,289
You'll look super glamorous.

97
00:06:48,015 --> 00:06:51,072
My beloved Mother-in-law.

98
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:56,542
As pretty as you are, you're naive too.

99
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,047
You're always in the dark.

100
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:03,136
You're always putting up with things

101
00:07:03,585 --> 00:07:05,603
but I won't.

102
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,426
My dear Kamya, are you done

103
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:11,738
creating suspense?

104
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:13,151
If yes

105
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:15,749
just be out with

106
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:18,999
the news that's troubling you.

107
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:21,809
It's a scintillating piece of news!

108
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,804
Do you know what your sister-in-law
is planning tomorrow?

109
00:07:25,924 --> 00:07:27,806
Without seeking your approval

110
00:07:27,926 --> 00:07:31,221
she has chosen the successor
of the Bharadwaj family.

111
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,634
- What are you saying?
- It's true.

112
00:07:39,102 --> 00:07:41,437
How could Sumitra take that decision

113
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,581
without consulting with me?

114
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:46,348
I am the eldest daughter-in-law

115
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:48,022
of this family.

116
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:50,099
I'm her senior.

117
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,460
I call the shots here.

118
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,117
'Be ready for the blast!'

119
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,118

122
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,911
Are you coming like this to the airport?

123
00:08:10,627 --> 00:08:11,907
I told her

124
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:14,151
it's not a wedding!

125
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:15,439
Exactly!

126
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:18,498
Sister-in-law Jyoti, look at me.

127
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:24,919
This is called the airport look.

128
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,003
Suraj couldn't take his eyes off me.

129
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,355
Of course, Tanya, you look gorgeous.

130
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:31,638
You're too good.

131
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:34,581
Wait till you see my mother-in-law.

132
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:44,707
That's grandma for you.

133
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:52,322
I call the shots here.

134
00:08:55,314 --> 00:08:58,501
What say, Sumitra?

135
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,732
No doubt about it.

136
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,059
The Bharadwaj family will take the airport
by a storm

137
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:11,441
only if it makes it there!

138
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,792
Please spare Akash!

139
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:23,624
He has landed

140
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:25,712

I know where.

with the others.

I'm sure, such a girl doesn't exist
in Ayodhya.

189
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:47,998
Why not?

190
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:51,406
There's an Eve for every Adam.

191
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:56,064
I'm sure, your partner awaits you.

192
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:59,878
Nandu, you argued
with the moneylender again!

193
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:02,179
You know it's your wedding today.

194
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:04,166
What if things had gotten out of hand?

195
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:07,293
When you were little, your parents died

196
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:09,096
and left you in my care.

197
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,152
I raised you

198
00:13:12,284 --> 00:13:15,429
so you'd marry in a good family
and I'd rest in peace.

199
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:18,915
Grandpa, it's live in peace.

200
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:20,820
Yes, whatever.

201
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:26,035
I just want to see you dressed as a bride

202
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:27,207
and get you married off.

203
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:40,718
You can't bear to part from me
yet you want me to marry.

204
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:43,458
- Why so?
- My child, I want you

205
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:46,223
to live a happy married life.

206
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,525
But, Grandpa,
this village is akin to heaven.

207
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,173
What heaven?

208
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:52,918
Farmers live terrible lives.

209
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,523
We're called

210
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:56,675
sons of the soil

211
00:13:56,808 --> 00:13:59,303
who feed the world

212
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,803
yet we die of hunger!

213
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:04,153
We're either beseeching heavens for rains

214
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:06,472
or begging money lenders

215
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:08,827
to give us grace period for loans.

216
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,207
I don't want you to

217
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:14,118
ruin your life in this soil.

218
00:14:14,223 --> 00:14:16,381
So, just get married

219
00:14:16,798 --> 00:14:18,104
and live in the city.

220
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,421
Grandpa, I've made a decision.

221
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:26,195
I won't give up my duties here
after getting married.

222
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:27,863
After getting married

223
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,231
I'll serve my in-laws

224
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:32,599
and fulfil my duties here as well.

225
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:36,032
Understood? Need I say more?

226
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,170
Grandma!

227
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,089
- I am ready.
- Oh, wow.

228
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:46,369
Come.

229
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:47,954
Grandma, now that I'm here

230
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:49,881
I'll be at your service.

231
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:51,722
- Is it?
- You just take rest, okay?

232
00:14:51,817 --> 00:14:53,339
- Okay.
- No more work.

233
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:56,302
I've to attend a friend's wedding
in the evening.

234
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:57,333
May I?

235
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:59,362
Of course, you may go.

236
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:01,764
For all you know

237
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:03,037
you might find your love there.

238
00:15:03,158 --> 00:15:05,634
I don't think so, Grandma.
I feel

239
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,530
I won't marry a local girl

240
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:09,228
but a foreigner.

241
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:11,411
No, Akash.

242
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:13,950
Things will go as per Lord Ram's wish.

243
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:15,182
You'll see

244
00:15:15,424 --> 00:15:17,157
how His plans unfold.

245
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:19,759
- Come.
- Let's go.

246
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:27,891
'The oldie's here.'

247
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,246
'I won't miss this time around.'

248
00:15:34,304 --> 00:15:36,350
What are you doing?
Give me the key, I'll drive.

249
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:06,242
Hello.

250
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:09,954
- Greetings.
- Just make sure

251
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:14,181
nothing's lacking in catering
to our guests.

252
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:15,895
Nothing will lack.

253
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:19,397
I'm just waiting for the groom

254
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:21,515
so that we can perform
the welcoming ceremony.

255
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:24,223
That will happen pretty soon.

256
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:25,713
Just come with me.

257
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:33,514
Please call the groom.

258
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:38,070
As soon as you grease my palm as decided.

259
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,522
200,000 rupees!

260
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:44,229
I see, hold on.

261
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:07,096
You never have money to repay my loan

262
00:17:07,216 --> 00:17:09,649
but you have loads for this wedding.

263
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:12,970
Sir, this is for Nandini's wedding.

264
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,131
I will repay your loan gradually.

265
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:16,942
Mr. Ram, try saying that

266
00:17:17,115 --> 00:17:18,422
to Nandini's in-laws!

267
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:21,772
This amount

268
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:23,939
pays off your tractor debt.

269
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,454
I'll recover the rest eventually.

270
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:29,632
Thank you, Akash.
I didn't think, you'd make it.

271
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,830
Oh, come on! We're school buddies.
How could I miss it?

272
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:35,222
- Let's go in.
- Wait.

273
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,274
Yes, Dad. I'm about to enter.

274
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,599
Don't come in until I say so.

275
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:46,417
'Guess he didn't get paid yet.'

276
00:17:47,778 --> 00:17:49,517
What's wrong? Let's go.

277
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:50,940
No

278
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:54,054
I can't go in until dad says so.

279
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,520
Why not?

280
00:17:56,848 --> 00:17:58,750
Guess the girl's family
hasn't fulfilled our condition.

281
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:03,299
Look, conditions are meant
for business, not marriage.

282
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:05,868
Be a man, bro. Your bride awaits you.

283
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:07,026
Let's go in.

284
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:10,732
Mr. Ram

285
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:12,931
you lost the money.

286
00:18:14,406 --> 00:18:17,805
No money, no marriage.

287
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:22,734
Money is more important than the bride.

288
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:27,003
I beg your pardon

289
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:38,933
my grandpa has taught me

290
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:42,407
not to speak unless spoken to.

291
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:47,961
But you compelled me

292
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:51,320
to speak up.

293
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,168
You're particular about accounts.

294
00:18:56,027 --> 00:18:57,899
So am I.

295
00:18:58,844 --> 00:19:02,248
To give you 200,000 rupees

296
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,483
my grandpa sacrificed

297
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:06,449
his hunger and sleep

298
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:08,946
to organise that amount.

299
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,591
He didn't keeps tabs of that

300
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:13,446
but I did.

301
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:17,304
He wept a million tears worrying
about his granddaughter

302
00:19:17,527 --> 00:19:19,059
at the cost of his well-being.

303
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:20,923
His eyesight weakened

304
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:24,610
yet he didn't stop dreaming
of my marriage.

305
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:28,745
You said, nothing should be lacking
in catering to the guests.

306
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,652
He broke his back

307
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:32,916
tending to your demands.

308
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,325
What for?

309
00:19:35,337 --> 00:19:37,634
Simply because
he's the bride's grandfather?

310
00:19:40,173 --> 00:19:43,393
And you...
The groom's father won't compromise.

311
00:19:44,903 --> 00:19:47,687
Why so? Why won't you compromise?

312
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:50,103
You have a mighty sharp tongue.

313
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,011
I should've demanded for 5,00,000

314
00:19:52,131 --> 00:19:54,134
instead of 200,000.

315
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:56,035
- 5,00,000?
- Yes.

316
00:19:57,883 --> 00:20:00,217
Is that all your son is worth?

317
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:10,451
My grandpa says, I am invaluable.

318
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:16,428
Thus, this isn't a match between equals.

319
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:19,349
We will neither pay you

320
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,325
nor beg your son to marry me.

321
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,605
Go away.

322
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,817
Nandu, don't say that.

323
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,139
Why not? You taught me how Lord Ram

324
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:36,548
was a man of principles.

325
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:39,358
But if demons cross their limits

326
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:42,403
they should be annihilated.

327
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:45,566
Understood?

328
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:47,602
Need I say more?

329
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:50,403
I think

330
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:53,990
I should set your spineless son right too.

Let's settle your account.

341
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:04,040
How much are you worth?

342
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:05,399
2,00,000?

343
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,497
I'd like to see what
I am paying Rs. 2,00,000 for?

344
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:11,624
Dowry?

346
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:15,316
what nonsense is this?

347
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:17,852
I mean, how can you demand dowry?

348
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:20,413
So? What's wrong in that?

349
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:22,247
It's a custom here.

350
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:24,812
I've to get my sisters married eventually.

351
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,662
I, too, will have to pay dowry then.

352
00:22:28,412 --> 00:22:29,431
I'll need money for that.

353
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:31,465
Fine, here you go.

354
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,420
Stop it.

355
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,420
I'll talk to him.

356
00:22:56,396 --> 00:22:58,317
Vikas, this is really wrong.

357
00:22:58,887 --> 00:23:00,878
If you really need money, I'll give you.

358
00:23:00,998 --> 00:23:02,477
Two lakh, three lakh,
whatever amount you want.

359
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:04,656
What are you saying?

360
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:06,213
You're asking him to demand
for more dowry!

361
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,282
Claim any amount you want!

362
00:23:08,402 --> 00:23:09,604
What nonsense!

363
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:11,981
I didn't ask him to demand for dowry.

364
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:14,221
Dear God! You just said that.

365
00:23:14,838 --> 00:23:17,436
Guess I should hand you
to the police as well

366
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:19,449
for demanding dowry.

367
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:20,860
Have you lost your mind?

368
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,174
Enough with the English.

369
00:23:23,596 --> 00:23:25,807
Don't try to intimidate me.

370
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:26,984
What's with this

371
00:23:27,104 --> 00:23:28,540
brazen negotiations?

372
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:29,914
Making demands!

373
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:31,766
Two lakh rupees for a railway employee

374
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:33,201
three lakh for a policeman

375
00:23:33,355 --> 00:23:35,800
and five lakh for a doctor or an engineer!

376
00:23:38,263 --> 00:23:40,719
Hey, English hero, what's your amount?

377
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:42,602
How much are you worth?

378
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,014
Way beyond your imagination!

379
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:47,717
He has studied abroad.

380
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:49,133
Oh!

381
00:23:49,724 --> 00:23:52,452
So a million to say the least.

382
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:55,748
Will that do or...

383
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,718
- Listen...
- Is this a market

384
00:23:57,838 --> 00:23:59,543
where educated suitors

385
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:01,513
get auctioned?

386
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:03,595
I didn't ask for dowry.

387
00:24:05,106 --> 00:24:06,479
Why are you targeting me?

388
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:08,774
Ma'am

389
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:11,426
since you don't speak English,
I'll explain in Hindi.

390
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:14,135
I am against the dowry system.

391
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:15,541
Understood?

392
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:17,728
I say this to all of you.

393
00:24:17,848 --> 00:24:19,744
You should neither give dowry

394
00:24:20,094 --> 00:24:21,972
nor marry suitors asking for dowry.

395
00:24:22,423 --> 00:24:23,312
Understood?

396
00:24:23,432 --> 00:24:24,476
What do we do then?

397
00:24:25,438 --> 00:24:27,832
This girl should call off this wedding.

398
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:35,201
Listen up, lad.
Such things happen abroad.

399
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:39,522
In our society, if a bride
is abandoned at the wedding

400
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:42,219
nobody marries her.

401
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:44,285
She remains unmarried for life.

402
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,827
What rubbish!
Why won't anyone marry her?

403
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:49,204
Anybody will.

404
00:24:49,302 --> 00:24:50,828
Will you marry her?

405
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:54,744
Answer me, will you?

406
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:56,214
Why drag me into this?

407
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:57,772
Why would I marry her?

408
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:00,883
He'll marry the one

409
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:02,765
who pays him the most.

410
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:07,971
No, not for money.

411
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:10,524
I'll marry the one who wins my heart.

412
00:25:13,047 --> 00:25:15,915
A girl who can be a worthy companion.

413
00:25:16,623 --> 00:25:18,836
A life partner due to whom

414
00:25:18,956 --> 00:25:20,250
my head would be held high.

415
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,246
Not someone I can't even talk to.

416
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:24,443
Oh, forget it,
I can't tolerate your presence.

417
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:26,086
I can't tolerate you either.

418
00:25:26,313 --> 00:25:27,123
Understood?

419
00:25:43,317 --> 00:25:44,486
- Let's go, this wedding is called off.
- Mr. Jeevan.

420
00:25:44,606 --> 00:25:47,053
Look, if you leave like this

421
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:48,736
we'll be humiliated.

422
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:49,726
Move!

423
00:25:50,403 --> 00:25:51,541
Grandpa!

424
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:57,295
Let's go. This wedding is cancelled.

425
00:25:57,785 --> 00:25:58,886
Grandpa!

426
00:25:59,427 --> 00:26:00,686
Grandpa, you...

427
00:26:03,025 --> 00:26:04,658
'I'll make sure that him and his son'

428
00:26:04,778 --> 00:26:07,523
'fall at grandpa's feet and apologise.'

429
00:26:10,214 --> 00:26:12,129
Sumitra!

430
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,018
Sumitra! Sumitra!

431
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,533
Sumitra!

432
00:26:17,722 --> 00:26:18,768
What's the matter, Mother-in-law?

433
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,895
Is that a new chant?

434
00:26:22,308 --> 00:26:25,205
You're chanting Sumitra
instead of the lord's name!

435
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:27,530
What?

436
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,633
I was chanting Sumitra's name?

437
00:26:33,502 --> 00:26:38,530
Sumitra has ruined my life!

438
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:41,212
She has messed with my mind.

439
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,225
What do I tell you, Kamya?

440
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:48,005
I was the elder daughter-in-law
in this family.

441
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:51,298
But the day Sumitra
got married into this family

442
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:55,804
my in-laws entrusted her

443
00:26:55,937 --> 00:26:58,203
with the household and business too.

444
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,731
She has seized all the power

445
00:27:02,891 --> 00:27:05,676
and orders us around.

446
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:10,764
Then, you should find
a way to overpower her.

447
00:27:10,884 --> 00:27:12,835
I'll help you.

448
00:27:16,944 --> 00:27:18,502
'Kamya is right.'

449
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:20,924
'I have to get Sumitra under my control'

450
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:24,461
'by finding Akash a suitable bride.'

451
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:28,535
'If he marries a cunning lass'

452
00:27:28,718 --> 00:27:30,661
'Sumitra will rule this house'

453
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:32,703
'not me!'

454
00:27:32,892 --> 00:27:35,185
'I can't let that happen.'

455
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:54,153
What's wrong, English hero?
All alone?

456
00:27:55,623 --> 00:27:57,377
Where's your friend?

457
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,517
At the police station.

458
00:27:58,732 --> 00:28:00,996
I handed him to the cops
for demanding dowry.

459
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,495
I see. I threatened you both.

460
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:07,671
Hence, you left him alone
at the police station

461
00:28:07,807 --> 00:28:09,143
so that you can be the good guy.

462
00:28:09,712 --> 00:28:13,536
This is why I want to marry a foreigner
and not the likes of you.

463
00:28:14,815 --> 00:28:17,721
Girls like you
just don't understand anything.

464
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:19,743
Foolish!

465
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:25,504
What? I'm foolish?

466
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:28,883
Because I hail from a village?

467
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:30,812
What did you say back there?

468
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,732
I am not a worthy companion?

469
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,519
Why? Because I am a villager!

470
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:40,246
Yes, I am a villager.

471
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:42,016
But don't underestimate me.

472
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:45,265
Girls from villages aren't always docile.

473
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:47,211
We're well bred

474
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:49,947
capable of raising a family

475
00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:52,930
and if need be

476
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,200
they can fiercely protect their family.

477
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:59,505
I don't speak English

478
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,581
but that doesn't mean that I'm no good.

479
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,300
I'm a farmer, adept at ploughing

480
00:29:09,085 --> 00:29:10,505
and driving a tractor too.

481
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:12,152
Can you drive a tractor?

482
00:29:13,723 --> 00:29:14,533
No!

483
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,547
What was that you said?

484
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:20,420
You want a life partner

485
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,039
due to whom your head will be held high.

486
00:29:24,483 --> 00:29:27,811
When I'll drive my tractor, you'll have to
hold your head high to see me.

487
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,316
Understood?

488
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:32,511
Need I say more?
