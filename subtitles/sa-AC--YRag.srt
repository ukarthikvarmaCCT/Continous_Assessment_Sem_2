- Fake letter?
- Paras.

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,240
How can Paras be so pathetic?

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,760
Look, Mr. Kaul. Our mothers

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,200
have always disliked each other.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,320
Look at them now.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,480
They are keeping
their differences aside

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,240
and are there for us as our mothers

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,360
in front of the world.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,480
This is good.

These wounds didn't go in vain.

Wait, sir!

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,680
I will call you back in some time.

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,320
What are you doing? Tell me!

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Let me go. I need an answer.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,280
Did you think

29
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,480
that I wouldn't know
who attacked Raghav?

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,320
You made a grave mistake
this time, Kailash Durani.

31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,720
You attacked my daughter and Raghav.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,560
Your son is behind
the accident, right?

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,560
Or is it your allies? Answer me!

34
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,040
I need an answer!

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,040
I am not your employee, Mr. Sharma.

We are business partners.

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,160
Who gave you the right
to show up like this?

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,880
I will see to it that you are
not capable of doing anything.

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,800
I will ensure your son
gets capital punishment.

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,600
Really?

41
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,640
What for? Is someone dead?

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,000
If any harm befalls
my children, then...

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,520
Neither you nor your children

44
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
matter to us.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,480
Whether they are legitimate

46
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,440
or illegitimate.

47
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,120
Why do we care?

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,320
Therefore, rather than
ruining your image any further,

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,960
it is best if you leave.

50
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,280
I am leaving!

51
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,680
But I will bring the police
this time.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,600
Your son has been in prison
for a year.

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,120
Rest assured, I'll see to it
that he goes to jail this time,

54
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,000
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,880
If you do anything to my son...

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,560
You and your son

57
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,800
will both go to jail.

58
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,680
I don't spare anyone
who attacks my children.

59
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,240
Don't forget, Kailash Durani.

60
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,760

62
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,560
I will deal with those women
who have patched up.

63
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,120
But Avinash will ruin the game.

64
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,440
You can keep all of this
if you want.

65
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,200
No! Not me.

66
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,880
Please help us.

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,320
You are helping us.

68

We didn't run away from home.

69
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,320
There are goons after us.
The police are with them.

70
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,200
Our families will get into trouble
if we are caught.

71
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,920
Please help us.

72
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,000
There is so much pain and wound.

73
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,280
Who inflicted them?
Where will you go?

74
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
I will be right back.

[tense music playing]

76
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,200
Mr. Kaul, I think
he will help us for sure.

77
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,520
But as long as we are in this city,

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,320
we will be in danger
because of Paras.

79
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,680
How do I save you?

80
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,400
How do I protect you?

waiting back won't help.

86
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,000
They will call us once
they get any news.

87
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,040
- Get some rest.
- I cannot do that, Avinash.

88
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,080
Rather than going home and
being restless, I might as well...

89
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,600
Until I find out
anything about Poshai...

90
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,240
Preeti, everything will be fine.

91
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,320
Fine?

92
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,320
What will be fine, Avinash?

93
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,080
My daughter has been through a lot.

94
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,440
What makes you say
everything will be fine?

95
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,840
Preeti!

96
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Lord Shiva will
make everything right.

97
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,080
Avinash had said something once.

98
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,560
And I was against it.

99
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,320
But I agree with him.

100
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,120
I always wanted Raghav

to be in love.

102

I wanted him to know what love was.

When Raghav and Aisha
were getting engaged,

I prayed to God

106
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,560
that my son should know
what it is to be in love.

What I wanted

114

is what happened.

115
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,520
Just that things didn't go
the way I wanted them to.

Ms. Mohena!

I wanted the same.

I wanted my daughter to find someone

119

who loved her immensely.

120
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,720

We got what we
wanted for our children.

'They leave us alone.'

'They don't even look back, Poshai.'

134
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,120
I always told Poshai

135
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,440
not to fall in love
with an outsider.

with a Kashmiri man.

Her innocence

145

made me and her realise

146
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,040
that Raghav is from Kashmir.

147
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,000
He belongs to this land.

148
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,480
He's just a little far away.

149
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
And for Raghav, Pashminna is the one

150

who introduced him to his home.

Mrs. Mohena, then why did we...

155

Why did we tear them apart?

156
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,040
Stubbornness got the better of us.

157
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,320
I was convinced

158
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,720
that Poshai's love was wrong.

Aisha tried her best
to explain it to me.

160
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,160
She distanced herself from Raghav
and Pashminna. But I...

I felt like Raghav didn't
break Aisha's heart,

he broke my heart.

And I failed to understand anything.

find out anything about them?

What happened?
Did you find out anything?

270
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,640
Nothing yet. But Uncle Avi is in
touch and Preeti mom is with him.

271
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,720
It's strange, isn't it?

272
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,640
We always put Uncle Avi
before our dad all our life.

273
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,560
He had done so many
favours for our family.

274
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,160
And then, the truth changed.

275
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,640
He went from being our benefactor

276
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,480
to our biggest enemy in a second.

277
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,120
And then because of
Aunt Preeti and Pashminna,

278
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,240
he came back into our lives,

279
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,360
and yours too.

280
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,560
- True.
- He's your father-in-law.

281
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,680
You know, sometimes
I think that maybe,

they'll get back together.
Everyone needs a companion.

will ever forgive Uncle Avi.

when Pashminna returns
and we get married,

293
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,000
then we'll plan

Aunt Preeti married.

Raghav in this too.

We'll involve Pashminna too.

Because Pashminna is
the most romantic of all.

And we'll get them
married on a houseboat.

If not a houseboat,
then in Kaul Cottage.

301

Otherwise, they won't agree to that.

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,840
We can do that.

303
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,680
I mean, Uncle Avi
is genuinely sorry.

304
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,680
And everyone should get a chance
to correct their mistakes, right?

305
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,240
Makes sense.

know what my last mission will be?

To get you married.

You thanked me.
This means you are ready.

Nowadays, there are dating apps,

326
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,640
I didn't thank you for that.

327
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,040
I said it because

328
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,680
you made me forget about
my problem for a brief moment.
