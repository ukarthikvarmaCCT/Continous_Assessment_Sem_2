00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,747
Recently, Flying Beast

2
00:00:01,772 --> 00:00:05,623
has filed a defamation legal case
of 2 crores against a journalist.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,993
What is true and what is not.

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:10,170
Will discuss it today.

5
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:11,759
Let's know in this video.

6
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:14,437
The purpose of this
video is not to hate anyone,

7
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:18,665
only to put a researched
opinion in front of you.

8
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:20,181
And in the end I
will leave it to you,

9
00:00:20,413 --> 00:00:21,778
what did you understand,

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,034
and what do you consider
to be wrong and right.

11
00:00:25,307 --> 00:00:27,744
This video is just for education
and awareness, which is our mission

12
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:29,635
and we believe that
nothing will be hidden now.

13
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:30,971
All the things,

14
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,464
that I am sharing here, you
will find their public sources

15
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:36,656
through the link in the video description
and you can read them yourself.

16
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:38,938
Flying Beast has announced
on his Instagram handle,

17
00:00:38,963 --> 00:00:40,043
that he has won a case.

18
00:00:40,132 --> 00:00:41,552
Will analyze that case completely,

19
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:43,578
and together with the
Havan Controversy.

20
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:45,486
This tweet you are seeing,

21
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:48,019
was tweeted by Flying Beast
on its own Twitter handle.

22
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:49,926
and after that there
was a lot of trolling.

23
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:52,555
So was Flying
Beast right or wrong?

24
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:54,519
Whether his trolling
was right or wrong,

25
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:55,519
we will analyze it.

26
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:58,577
And together we will discuss
what's the responsibility of influencers,

27
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:01,246
journalists and brands.

28
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,958
Who should be guilty
in this whole matter

29
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:07,008
and who is not,
let's talk in this video.

30
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:08,264
Let's go.

31
00:01:09,147 --> 00:01:13,816
Flying Beast is a person
who practices his culture

32
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:18,596
and talks about it loudly.

33
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:21,406
Someone has a face in their culture,

34
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:23,358
and feel proud about his culture,

35
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,996
and Flying Beasts do the same,

36
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:29,047
because their content is
family vlogging, real life vlogging,

37
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:31,103
which is visible in their
vlogs and tweets.

38
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:33,495
When Flying Beast does
this, Abhishek Bakshi,

39
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,482
a so-called journalist,

40
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:36,405
attacks Flying Beast,

41
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:40,542
and says that Abish
Mathew, who is a huge creator,

42
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,377
whose show is visited
by big celebrities.

43
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,202
[big celebrities]

44
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:50,483
[big celebrities]

45
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,539
How did this bring these people,

46
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:54,216
who do not know,

47
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:56,797
on which fruit their
daughter's name is.

48
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,969
Obviously here Abhishek was right

49
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:05,012
that there is a difference
between raspberry and Rashbhari.

50
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:06,438
It is not that

51
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:09,638
there is an English meaning
and its Hindi meaning is this.

52
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:11,066
It's not like this.  Both
are different fruits.

53
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,896
But...

54
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:14,955
But would you judge
someone's credentials by this?

55
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:17,646
Flying Beast is collaborating
with Abish Mathew here,

56
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,093
who has 1 million subscribers,

57
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:21,295
and Flying Beast has so many.

58
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:24,256
So, who has more advantage here,

59
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:26,813
maybe Abhishek
could not understand.

60
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:29,230
Maybe some people who
think they are intllectual,

61
00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:30,548
and think that they are
creative. They think that,

62
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:32,416
understanding English
is very important.

63
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:39,131
He did not see how many amazing
stories Ritu and Gaurav shared,

64
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:41,211
on the naming of their daughter.

65
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:42,896
I guess he missed it.

66
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:44,689
Ritu and I were expecting
to download this app.

67
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:45,595
So, we downloaded this app.

68
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:46,851
Someone suggested, my sister suggested!

69
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:49,639
So, every week , it used to
show the progress of baby.

70
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:51,760
Now the baby is of almost puppy size,

71
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:53,327
grown to the size of this,

72
00:02:53,664 --> 00:02:55,801
I think, during 8 weeks or nine weeks,

73
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:58,426
Now your baby's size is of raspberry.

74
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:03,363
That's she was pleased to know
that my baby is like a raspberry.

75
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:05,055
Like a raspberry.

76
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:07,476
And then Rashhnhari...Rashbhari.. 
-We started calling her.

77
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:10,866
Which was a very good highlight of
this interview of this entire segment.

78
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,370
These stories are not PR driven,

79
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:14,618
they are real.

80
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,604
Abhishek could not understand this,

81
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:18,297
but his attack continued,

82
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:19,417
and he has made four tweets.

83
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:23,253
He spoke dirty words
about Flying Beast,

84
00:03:23,278 --> 00:03:24,485
and attacked Brands.

85
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:29,011
He started attacking the
livelihood of flying beast.

86
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,620
Abhishek If you are not
getting the brands yourself

87
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:38,383
then where is it right to make such
attacks on someone else's livelihood?

88
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:40,946
Is this right or wrong, please
tell me in the comments.

89
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,006
All who are watching this video,

90
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:45,549
before you think, that
videos is going to be biased,

91
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:50,462
Watch my video which was
about Flying Beast's birthday.

92
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,202
You will understand that I'm not a fan,

93
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:55,125
I'm not a fellow creator,

94
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,821
who's just trying to say goody
things about one of the creator,

95
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:59,420
I feel it was a huge blunder,

96
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:02,486
whether it was wrong or
right to arrest. I don't know!

97
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:04,927
But when you have
booked an entire metro,

98
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:06,057
and you have so
many million followers,

99
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:08,573
even after booking the entire
metro, you cannot handle them.

100
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:10,989
So it was blunder in a way.

101
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,316
Nobody can take that away!

102
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,644
Everything on this
channel is unbiased,

103
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:18,593
depending upon who's
right and who's wrong,

104
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,390
all that particular incident
on that particular day,

105
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:22,605
on that particular event.

106
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:26,790
And to analyze this event, many
things will have to be analyzed

107
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:27,595
and that is what we are doing.

108
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:28,438
Keep watching!

109
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:33,196
The fourth tweet of Abhishek in
this is very shameful.

110
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,460
In this, he is telling that the
flying beast is mysogynist.

111
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:38,011
Do you understand misogynist?

112
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:41,734
One who discriminates
against another gender.

113
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,755
Many more words have come from Misogynist,
like Patriarchy and many other words.

114
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:52,198
In this, he highlights an incident
in which Ritu is in labor pain

115
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:53,948
nd she touches Gaurav's feet.

116
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:55,386
He has shown a snapshot.

117
00:04:55,652 --> 00:05:04,615
But I would love to show
you the full energy of that vlog,

118
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:05,560
See!

119
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:09,113
Now, Ritu is actually in labour.

120
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:11,639
But what she is saying
- I didn't touch feet.

121
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:12,849
So, I'm going to do that.

122
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:16,327
She's touching feet.

123
00:05:25,796 --> 00:05:29,392
I don't know if those educated
and intellectual people know,

124
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:32,021
touching feet is not just about

125
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:33,586
mysogyny and

126
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:35,911
somebody being superior or inferior.

127
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:36,849
It's about transmitting energies.

128
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:41,873
When a woman is in labor
pain, she needs energy.

129
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:43,589
So touching her feet
means taking energy.

130
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,130
I think this is the thing which is in
our old culture that people do not know.

131
00:05:49,397 --> 00:05:52,469
That's why people create
judgments and assumptions

132
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:55,362
and attack people in such a way that

133
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:57,285
why are you
collaborating with them.

134
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:58,487
Shameful!

135
00:05:58,916 --> 00:05:59,860
I would like to ask,

136
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:04,500
if a man is practicing his religion,

137
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:07,692
practicing his faith and his
culture, what's wrong in that?

138
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:11,409
Could that be a basis whether those
brands collaborate with him or not?

139
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:13,931
Absurd!

140
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:14,693
Let's go forward.

141
00:06:15,076 --> 00:06:16,901
Before we talk about Shephali's article,

142
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,047
on whom there is a defamation
case of full two crores.

143
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:22,192
Before analyzing that article,

144
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:23,598
I want to talk about
the Havan controversy,

145
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:26,221
which is related to this article because this
article starts from tweets related to havan.

146
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,142
tweets related to havan.

147
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:29,859
Let's talk a little bit
about this controversy.

148
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:32,925
I didn't give my take at that
time but I want to give now.

149
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,571
It's very important.

150
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:41,665
Gaurav tweets on 1st May that there
is 'house warming ceremony' in our house

151
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,937
which he writes as planet,

152
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:46,037
which is okay, people trolled him on this

153
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,116
which is again...

154
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:51,348
He says that we're doing
'house warming ceremony'.

155
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:53,874
Hinduism is a science based way of life.

156
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,179
On 3rd Dec. 1984,

157
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,284
two families remained
unaffected from Bhopal gas leak,

158
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:00,524
and fourth is that,

159
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:05,318
Havan which is a natural
antidote to polllution.

160
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,275
He said these four things.

161
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,515
Many people trolled him on this.

162
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:11,120
I would like to say
something about this.

163
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:15,956
Let us first talk abou
Bhopal gas tragedy,

164
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,743
More than 3000 people died in it.

165
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,032
More than 500000
people were injured.

166
00:07:21,244 --> 00:07:24,776
And after this accident,
12000 people died.

167
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,867
And we are seeing the
after effects of that thing till today.

168
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,638
And it was because
that gas was too toxic.

169
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:33,755
One of the most toxic gases in the world.

170
00:07:34,058 --> 00:07:35,709
Methyl isocyanate.

171
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:39,156
That's a very dangerous compund.

172
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,505
Due to this, there is maximum
penetration in your lungs,

173
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:43,866
then there can be choking there.

174
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,210
And because of this
many people also died.

175
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,474
And...

176
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,356
let's analyze this tweet a bit.

177
00:07:49,612 --> 00:07:51,572
He said, Hinduism is
a science based of life.

178
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:55,138
I thought religion is a set
of believes and practices.

179
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,658
For ex, just like there are
mantras in our Hindu religion

180
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:01,742
I also chant mantras,

181
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:06,071
because I feel that the structure and
combination of some mantras is such that

182
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,670
it produces certain
vibrations and sounds.

183
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:12,541
And this sound very much
channelizes your state of mind,

184
00:08:12,823 --> 00:08:14,546
in the right direction and
for which the mantra is,

185
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:15,761
for which that sound
is being produced.

186
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:16,642
Right?

187
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,939
And if that's the case,
it's a science, right?

188
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:21,292
Because science...science is what?

189
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:25,048
If you observe such things, if
you chant mantras for 1 hour

190
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:27,384
and then see how you are feeling,

191
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:28,569
and how is the energy around you.

192
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:31,728
If you observe and see some
difference, that's a science.

193
00:08:31,882 --> 00:08:33,216
Science is all about that.

194
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:37,067
You take a hypothesis and if you
collect dataabout it and observe it,

195
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:37,992
that gives you the result.

196
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:38,858
So...

197
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:42,558
I'm okay with Gaurav's tweets about this,

198
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,831
that Hinduism is
a science based of life.

199
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:47,279
There're many things about
Hinduism, infact every religion.

200
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:49,201
 If you understand it properly,

201
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,480
it is very scientific.

202
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:54,386
But people assume
as I have already said.

203
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:55,924
That's the problem.

204
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,892
Then the third thing that Gaurav said,

205
00:08:57,935 --> 00:09:00,736
is that he told about an incident.

206
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,342
He told that the two families
were unaffected that day.

207
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:07,592
Infact he was referring to the
article which was published in,

208
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:10,048
English Daily in 1985.

209
00:09:10,312 --> 00:09:11,939
According to that article,
there are two families

210
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:14,743
in which one is Khuswaha family
and the other is Prajapati family.

211
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:16,444
Those both families remained unaffected.

212
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:19,302
You read this entire article,
link is in the description.

213
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:21,718
You can read this complete
article and it has complete details.

214
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,842
But that article...

215
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:25,721
We can't research on this.

216
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:27,665
Because there are so many
things in it that are missing.

217
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,339
There may be some other
reasons that that family survived,

218
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:32,704
sometimes there are
casual relationships too.

219
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:35,177
Now coming to the fourth
statement of Flying Beast.

220
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:38,236
He said, they performed
regular Agnihotra havan,

221
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:41,398
which is a natural antidote to pollution,

222
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:44,379
kind of leading to this thing that

223
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:47,692
that perhaps they were saved only
by performing Agnihotra Havan,

224
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:49,140
which is written in this article.

225
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:51,942
It is not as if Flying
Beast himself is telling.

226
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:53,946
 If we talk about this thing,

227
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:56,234
whether this is a natural
antidote to pollution or not,

228
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:57,777
Many people trolled Flying Beast.

229
00:09:57,872 --> 00:10:00,428
Lots of intellectual people
and educated people.

230
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:03,059
They were blabbering
without doing enough research,

231
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:04,059
and gathering facts.

232
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:10,638
Dhruv Rathi asked which gases
are they, which compound are they?

233
00:10:10,894 --> 00:10:13,085
Is it sulphur oxide
or nitrogen oxide?

234
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:15,333
Which oxide is that which gets reduced.

235
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,415
Akash Banerjee even spoke that
it was from WhatsApp University.

236
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,349
Abhishek Bakshi
came back and said,

237
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:24,104
And replied something
similar on the tweet.

238
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:27,579
I would like to say
that yes, I believe that

239
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:29,214
Methyl isocyanate gas,

240
00:10:29,857 --> 00:10:30,897
is a flammable gas,

241
00:10:31,032 --> 00:10:33,699
It interacts when it goes
into the atmosphere.

242
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:35,267
It changes its form.

243
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:38,959
And its effect is more on
the people living on the ground.

244
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:40,723
because there is
more density there.

245
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:45,496
But can you get relief if you are
performing Havan somewhere?

246
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:46,382
I don't know.

247
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:47,907
But guys, based on my research,

248
00:10:48,305 --> 00:10:50,917
all the intellectual people,

249
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:55,764
all the big creators
who're watching this video,

250
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:57,669
I want to share a
research with them.

251
00:10:58,078 --> 00:10:59,443
It is on Research Gate.

252
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:01,334
I am giving its link for
you to read yourself.

253
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:05,703
In that lab research
it is clearly written,

254
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:08,548
that when the Havan
material that is on your screen,

255
00:11:08,987 --> 00:11:11,526
when put in a controlled environment,

256
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:14,307
it was seen that sulfur
oxide and nitrogen oxide

257
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:20,057
Respirable Suspended Particulate
Matter were reduced by 60%.

258
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,254
And these different
quantities are in front of you.

259
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:23,320
You can check those.

260
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:24,957
And you can read the complete research.

261
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:26,022
Link is in the description.

262
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:30,024
Sulfur oxide and nitrogen
oxide are reduced by 50–60%,

263
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:31,225
says that research,

264
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:33,035
by doing havan.

265
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:40,553
If you rubbish any faith,
any culture, it is wrong.

266
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:44,324
And if Gaurav is referring
to something and saying

267
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:45,963
it has happened,

268
00:11:46,378 --> 00:11:48,021
should he be trolled?

269
00:11:48,046 --> 00:11:51,436
And should it be accused that
he is spreading propaganda?

270
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,694
I think this is wrong.

271
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,895
And here comes the
responsibility of the journalist.

272
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,089
Is this personal hatred
or is it their profession?

273
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,925
It is very important
to understand this

274
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:07,240
Now let's talk about this article
on which this case has run,

275
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:09,951
on the basis of which Ritu and Gaurav,

276
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,301
has filed a defamation case of two crores.

277
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,460
Let us analyze
what that article says.

278
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:19,010
Shefali refers to the incident of that
havan at the very beginning of this article

279
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:21,584
and says how Gaurav
was very insensitive,

280
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:24,313
for all those whose lives were lost
people in that tragedy.

281
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:26,770
He did not do research
or maybe he was in haste,

282
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:28,605
or was using Abhishek for facts,

283
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:29,901
whose history is telling that

284
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:33,868
that he has been a hater
of a particular ideology.

285
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,412
All these tweets tell.

286
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:41,662
If you refer to a person who is
associated with the government

287
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:44,404
vs some creator who is practicing his
culture,

288
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,128
and who does not
differentiate. I think this is wrong.

289
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:48,195
But Abhishek was not able
to differentiate.

290
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,551
He felt that Gaurav is the
part of a propaganda machine,

291
00:12:50,594 --> 00:12:54,811
and according to me he gave
all these facts to Shefali in haste.

292
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:56,973
And the facts which
he has given to Shefali,

293
00:12:57,314 --> 00:12:58,721
is just a small sample.

294
00:12:58,746 --> 00:13:01,679
Let's talk about this article
and what was the problem in it.

295
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:05,071
Shephali says that Gaurav
does child abuse.

296
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:09,155
And the incident that she has
highlighted, imagine what it could be.

297
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:12,524
It is that they are
piercing in her ears.

298
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:14,687
The girl is saying that do not do vlogging,

299
00:13:15,736 --> 00:13:17,625
then he is telling her why not.

300
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,786
This is child abuse.

301
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,385
She drops a phone
from a very high building,

302
00:13:22,974 --> 00:13:24,918
and her mother is scolding her,

303
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:25,990
so it is child abuse.

304
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:29,091
Shefali says that she has told
all this by a child psychologist,

305
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,687
Joy Santosh, which I
could not find anywhere.

306
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:34,706
But I would like to ask
whether it is child abuse or not.

307
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:39,726
How can you tell
from this reference?

308
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,954
You are targeting all the brands that
work with Flying Beast and Ritu Rathee.

309
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,295
based on your own
assumptions and prejudice.

310
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:49,430
And it is clear that
you do less research.

311
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:51,401
What is child abuse and what is not.

312
00:13:51,729 --> 00:13:54,046
I want to understand that

313
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:56,889
you are saying all this on
the basis of Joy Santosh,

314
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:57,707
which I am not getting anywhere.

315
00:13:58,408 --> 00:14:03,741
You are hunting brands and
asking them for a statement

316
00:14:03,766 --> 00:14:06,389
that why are you
collaborating with them?

317
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:09,018
As if that you're not liking it.

318
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:10,558
You are not getting the deals,

319
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:12,273
and these people are getting it.

320
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:15,637
There are many such
creators all over the world,

321
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:18,066
who do very strange
and big things,

322
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,584
 in fact there are many celebrities

323
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:21,200
who sell cancer.

324
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:23,805
You go to those celebrities
who promote such brands.

325
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,147
You go to a creator who
has a great track record,

326
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:30,937
who, even when in the fitness industry,

327
00:14:31,374 --> 00:14:32,588
used to talk about facts.

328
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,108
While there are many people,

329
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:36,992
who make and have been
making very irresponsible videos.

330
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:43,616
It is a big deal that those people get
ranking in the big magazines of our country.

331
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:44,681
It is a big deal.

332
00:14:44,706 --> 00:14:46,246
It is a big deal.

333
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,582
It is a big deal.

334
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:55,410
It is a big deal.

335
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:58,474
You fall behind because
of one or two references.

336
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:00,421
Is this right or wrong,

337
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:02,122
I would like to ask
you this question,

338
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:03,424
you guys tell me in the comments.

339
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,015
Shefali says that some
people are saying that

340
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,866
 they will not even use brands,

341
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:09,686
which are promoted by them.

342
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:14,300
And Shefali quotes a gossip handle
of a gossip community that it is posting.

343
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:16,636
This gossip post of
this gossip community,

344
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:18,210
is it a good sample to tell

345
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:20,426
that people are not
wanting to use this product

346
00:15:20,593 --> 00:15:21,998
you tell me in this comment box.

347
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:24,359
Or else it should be judged by that

348
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:27,276
what is the feature of the
product which is promoted by him.

349
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,596
How genuine is that product,

350
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,254
what are the reviews
of that product,

351
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,741
what is the actual experience
when you use that product.

352
00:15:34,158 --> 00:15:35,960
I would like to understand
this from Shefali,

353
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:37,841
whether she has done
this research or not.

354
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:39,472
You must have seen that

355
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:43,174
I do very little advertising
of products on this channel,

356
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,944
it is because I am not satisfied
with that product.

357
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,188
And if that was the case,
maybe it would make sense.

358
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,680
Shefali highlights another issue,

359
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:55,560
where Flying Beast is stating that
about risks of live in relationship

360
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,347
and what can be its consequences,

361
00:15:58,628 --> 00:16:00,025
so, on that basis,

362
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:03,129
that your opinion doesn't
match with her opinion,

363
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:06,648
so he shouldn't be working with brands?

364
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:07,783
Brands shoulsn't work with him.

365
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:08,630
Is it right?

366
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:11,519
He is just alerting people that
he has seen and heard this.

367
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,158
Such things come in the daily news

368
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,850
and if he is giving his opinion
on it then what is wrong in it.

369
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,702
He is saying that this is data.

370
00:16:19,037 --> 00:16:20,093
Have a look on the data.

371
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:22,397
I am not saying that live in
relationship is right or wrong.

372
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:25,724
Infact, I myself say that first
stay with each other and see.

373
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,680
But if you have
data in front of you,

374
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:29,778
and you are citing only that
data have some problems,

375
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:32,984
then because of this brands
should not work with the creators,

376
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,684
how far is it right or wrong, I
leave upto you. Please tell.

377
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:38,529
And I would like to ask that
Shefali says in the same article

378
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:40,276
that all this is the fault of
the brands not creators.

379
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,042
There are brands in the title,

380
00:16:42,107 --> 00:16:43,615
and only Flying Beast
is being talked about. Why?

381
00:16:43,663 --> 00:16:45,973
Shephali very smartly
twists the article,

382
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:47,658
This article is not
for the Flying Beast,

383
00:16:47,683 --> 00:16:49,287
even though I am talking about the
Flying Beast throughout the article.

384
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:51,567
This article is not for
Flying Beast, it is for brands.

385
00:16:51,592 --> 00:16:52,805
What is Brand's Responsibility?

386
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:54,356
I would like to ask you,

387
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:55,849
what is the
Responsibility of brands.

388
00:16:55,874 --> 00:16:56,913
Brands are commercial,

389
00:16:57,274 --> 00:16:59,313
they only see profit
and use creators.

390
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:00,363
They know that
creators have real reach,

391
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:02,657
their loyalty is direct connection.

392
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,476
My audience has a connection with me.

393
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:07,986
I've connection with the
people who are commenting below.

394
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,348
When they listen to me, they DMs me

395
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,191
that brother, you speak
on this. You are our hope

396
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:13,272
and I feel responsible.

397
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:14,899
I've such connection with you guys.

398
00:17:15,006 --> 00:17:17,029
These journalists like Shefali
will not be able to understand this,

399
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,349
or generalists like
Abhishek will not understand,

400
00:17:20,464 --> 00:17:22,115
what is your connection with me.

401
00:17:22,562 --> 00:17:25,371
how I make videos on your demand

402
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,152
and on my demand you do
campaigns with me on Twitter.

403
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:31,576
by devouting your precious time on my ask.

404
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:32,793
Such journalists
will not understand this.

405
00:17:33,478 --> 00:17:36,922
And I am not at all
satisfied here with Shephali,

406
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:38,069
that it is only the
responsibility of the brands,

407
00:17:38,094 --> 00:17:41,181
I think it is the responsibility of the
influencer to choose right product.

408
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,068
It is the responsibility of the journalist,

409
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:47,142
to write the article with full
research and with no hatred.

410
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:50,765
And the biggest responsibility here is
not that of influencers and journalists,

411
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,015
but your responsibility
here is that

412
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,388
if someone is selling pan masala
in the name of ad mouth freshener,

413
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:57,305
then please condemn them.

414
00:17:57,497 --> 00:18:00,354
I think it is clear that there are
many problems in this article.

415
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:01,660
I think that is the reason,

416
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:04,795
I am not saying that Flying Beast
and Ritu Rathi are right in everything,

417
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:05,942
They both also make mistakes.

418
00:18:06,134 --> 00:18:08,625
There is no human who
doesn't make mistakes.

419
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:09,716
Man is a mannequin of mistakes,

420
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:10,932
 I also make many mistakes,

421
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:14,649
and it is very important to
acknowledge my mistakes.

422
00:18:14,755 --> 00:18:18,366
Insinuating that performing Havan
is a political propaganda,

423
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,202
that's wrong.

424
00:18:19,227 --> 00:18:23,366
Talking about one or two things
about someone that you think is wrong,

425
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:26,823
saying on the basis that no one
should work with him,

426
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:28,024
that's wrong.

427
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,840
You are insinuating on a post
from someone of any gossip group,

428
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:35,056
and when you are
trolled on your article

429
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,218
then it becomes hatred,

430
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,607
how?

431
00:18:37,823 --> 00:18:38,973
Isn't this hypocrisy?

432
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:42,596
Do you fall behind such a creator,

433
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,885
who till date has not gone ahead
on the basis of controversies,

434
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,107
and has gone ahead on
the basis of his content,

435
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:50,409
vs you do not speak anything
to people who are selling cancer,

436
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:52,616
if this is not hypocrisy then what else?

437
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,252
If someone disagrees with you,

438
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:59,525
should it be the result that you
start attacking his/her livelihood.

439
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:01,228
And here you see the pattern,

440
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:03,897
that the person who is
supplying you the content,

441
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:05,233
is tweeting this again and again,

442
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:07,027
these tweets are from
a year ago, imagine.

443
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:11,542
A guy watches a movie
and promotes it, attack on him.

444
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:14,788
A man says that the vaccine
should be taken, attack on him.

445
00:19:15,006 --> 00:19:16,275
You guys tell me
whether it's right or wrong.

446
00:19:16,777 --> 00:19:19,983
And you think that
Intellectuals are right,

447
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:22,447
and do not mislead you,

448
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,441
you guys watch this video,

449
00:19:24,578 --> 00:19:26,840
its link is in the description and
you will also see in the I button.

450
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:33,452
I will say that if you like this video
then share it in your community,

451
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,526
don't forget to like and
comment on this video,

452
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,861
and share your
opinion in this thread.

453
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:42,364
We have two new communities
on Facebook and Telegram,

454
00:19:42,502 --> 00:19:43,487
 join them too,

455
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:44,995
I am sharing their links.

456
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:47,742
Because I think we should
be present on all platforms,

457
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,887
if we really need change to happen.

458
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,359
Because you're watching
Peepoye, I'm Akassh.

459
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:52,841
And now...

460
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:54,429
nothing will hide.
