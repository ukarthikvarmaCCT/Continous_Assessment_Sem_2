1
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:29,388
Is Mrs Laxmi Chaudhary in?
- Yes.

2
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:31,946
Sister, someone has
come to meet you.

3
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:36,098
Do come in and sit down.
- Our duty is to keep standing, Madam.

4
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,593
Yes? What is it?
- We're from the Income Tax.

5
00:01:42,673 --> 00:01:45,558
Your husband has been raided.
Let's go immediately.

6
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:48,293
My God! What do I do now?
- Don't worry, sister.

7
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:51,098
They're only Income Tax officers,
they won't harm you.

8
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:52,761
I'll accompany you.
Let's go.

9
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:10,894
Where's your master?
- He's inside.

10
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:26,538
We are doomed, Saraswati!
We are ruined!

11
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:29,226
What do I do now?

12
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:36,795
How often...

13
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:43,605
have I asked you not to hide the keys
of the locker behind God's picture?!

14
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,993
We've been raided now, haven't we?!
They'll take all away now!

15
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:50,831
The gold, the cash...
and this house!

16
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:53,435
No! Not the house!

17
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:56,329
They'll take away
everything. Everything!

18
00:02:56,734 --> 00:03:01,969
No! Please save this house!
I beg of you!

19
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,357
Please don't render
us homeless.

20
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:08,942
Very well. Since today is our
25th wedding anniversary...

21
00:03:09,526 --> 00:03:11,171
I can't refuse you anything.

22
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:15,040
I will do then, that which...

23
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:19,269
every sensible husband does!

24
00:03:22,882 --> 00:03:26,177
Here's the 100 Rupees...
Get going.

25
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:27,889
Only a hundred rupees, sir?

26
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,348
Now look; I was born after
the death of a 1000 misers!

27
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:34,883
Quietly take this...
or you get nothing!

28
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:37,548
I'll even call the cops
and tell them that...

29
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:42,026
some guys from the films posed
as policemen and kidnapped my wife!

30
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,412
We've done just as you
asked us to, sir.

31
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:46,720
But we get more money
to speak our lines!

32
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,227
You ought to be
large-hearted today...

33
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,255
let's the silver jubilee
of your wedding, after all!

34
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:57,309
Here's 10 more rupees...
and just get lost!

35
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:58,429
Thank you.

36
00:04:00,477 --> 00:04:03,055
Weren't they from the Income Tax, 
brother-in-law?

37
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:05,791
You were conned, weren't you?

38
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,182
Where was the need
to do all that?

39
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:12,783
When a wife goes away to
her parents' place on...

40
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:17,494
her 25th wedding anniversary,
what does a man do?

41
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:21,546
Your practical jokes will
ruin this home someday!

42
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:25,961
There's a limit! What if I had
suffered a heart-attack?

43
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,664
A heart-attack? Do you
have the heart, then?

44
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:33,518
Hadn't you given it away to me
25 years ago on our nuptial night?

45
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:36,131
Hush! Can't you see your
sister-in-law here?!

46
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:38,488
You're scaring me as if
she were a gun!

47
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:40,994
She's only a sister-in-law...
a half-wife!

48
00:04:41,462 --> 00:04:42,716
Now wait...

49
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:53,910
Here you are!
- Wow! It's beautiful!

50
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:55,810
Is this for me?
- Of course!

51
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:01,110
Looks like you will always
play jokes and buy gold!

52
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,046
I might get over the
habit of playing jokes.

53
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:06,996
But to admire the beauty of
the girls from the villages...

54
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:10,433
who are no less than
real gold...

55
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:12,993
I will never get over
my admiration for them.

56
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:23,855
Congratulations on your
wedding anniversary!

57
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:28,660
See how much your son loves
you both, brother-in-law?

58
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,516
He's bound you both
in just one garland!

59
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,599
It's Amit who will be bound
in matrimony now.

60
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:37,738
That's the gift I give you
on my anniversary, my son!

61
00:05:37,818 --> 00:05:40,329
There you go again!
Now yet, daddy!

62
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:42,610
You know marriage is going
to cost me dearly.

63
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,263
I've got to go to London for
my business-management course!

64
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,462
I've got to begin my career!
You know that, don't you?

65
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:50,639
There's no career bigger than
finding a good wife!

66
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:52,049
Look at your Mom...

67
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:55,353
I've had it made, ever since
I got married to her!

68
00:05:55,951 --> 00:06:00,923
And she even gave me
a certificate in you!

69
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:05,142
I've even found a girl.

70
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,097
I've only got to visit
Nirmal Village to finalise it.

71
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:10,723
A village?

72
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:17,167
You speak as if the word
has set your town on fire!

73
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:19,845
Yes, it's a village!
The Nirmal Village!

74
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:23,311
There's a beautiful girl there...

75
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:24,977
who will be my daughter-in-law!

76
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,776
I even have a picture.
Want to see it?

77
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:30,653
No thank you!
Because it won't help!

78
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,715
We have a sensible son, Laxmi!

79
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:39,290
He knows, no one can change
his father's decision!

80
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:42,288
Now look, Dad...
don't talk about that!

81
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,741
I know how you got used
to liking bitter-gourd!

82
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,179
Don't you know? Bitter-gourd
is fantastic for health!

83
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:52,251
It cleanses the system!

84
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:54,482
It's good for the heart
and the brain, you know?

85
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:56,345
I don't ! You're lying!

86
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:58,678
There's only one thing that's
good for the heart!

87
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:00,634
You must have a heart,
that is!

88
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,449
Tomorrow's the Independence
Day of the India.

89
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,887
I've been invited over
by the Headmaster...

90
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:14,972
and the girl belongs to
the same village!

91
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:18,184
That's called killing two
birds with one stone!

92
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:57,875
Raise your voice, children!

93
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:00,375
Glory to Mother India!

94
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:02,390
Glory to Mother India!

95
00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:09,671
I will request our Chief
Guest, Mr Chaudhary,...

96
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:12,176
to say a few words
to the children.

97
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:20,891
Dear children, you are the
citizens of tomorrow.

98
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:25,172
I will say more than
a few words.

99
00:08:27,518 --> 00:08:29,737
It has to do with the
slogan you chanted...

100
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:32,007
Glory to Mother India

101
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:36,121
I want to know what Glory
to Mother India means.

102
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:39,142
I want to know the importance
of the word Mother India

103
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:42,422
I will reward anyone who
gives me the right answer.

104
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,602
I'm surprised, children!

105
00:09:03,008 --> 00:09:05,608
Don't you know the meaning
of the expression...

106
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,465
you were just chanting?

107
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:12,108
Is there no one in
the village...

108
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:14,253
who knows what the expression
Mother India means?

109
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:22,706
Go on... of course!

110
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:24,718
I can give you the answer!

111
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:27,063
Wonderful!
Do come forward, Madhuri!

112
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:31,021
She's the one I told
you about, Mr Chaudhary.

113
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:32,101
I recognised her.

114
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:34,607
Greetings.

115
00:09:34,794 --> 00:09:37,723
Yes, dear? Should you
know the answer...

116
00:09:37,803 --> 00:09:40,624
you might get the reward.

117
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:47,816
By Mother India, we are
referring to our nation.

118
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:49,918
From Kashmir to Kanyakumari...

119
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,140
from the Arabian Seas
to the Bay of Bengal...

120
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,124
all the religions and
faiths that it fosters...

121
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:58,720
the Bible, the Geeta and the Koran
symbolise the spirit of India.

122
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:01,240
Mother India is the soul
of the nation...

123
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:06,081
that is worshipped
even by the Gods.

124
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:08,234
Which is why it is
called Mother India.

125
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,157
Let's say together then.
To India...

126
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,632
Glory be!

127
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,133
Mother!

128
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:22,802
Where are you, mother?!

129
00:10:23,576 --> 00:10:26,981
Madhuri has won a reward!

130
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:29,679
And the gentleman is personally
coming here to give her the reward!

131
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,079
Let's go out and see!
They must've arrived in their car.

132
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:43,162
Mother!
- Come dear.

133
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:47,290
Welcome...

134
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:52,733
This is Mr Chaudhary I spoke
to you about, Ganga.

135
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:58,229
You should've told us about
your visit. I'd have...

136
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:00,632
Please don't worry.

137
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:04,443
The Head Master invited
us to the school today.

138
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:07,371
And we thought we could deal
with both things today.

139
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:10,401
Deal with what?
- I'll explain.

140
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:15,822
I am greatly influenced
by my wife, Laxmi...

141
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:18,513
because she comes from the villages.
I believe that...

142
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:22,815
the beauty of the villages has a purity
and nobility that is lacking in cities

143
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:25,947
We have a son for whom
we had ideas...

144
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:29,510
after we saw a photograph
of Madhuri.

145
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:33,495
Now that we have met her and
seen how intelligent she is...

146
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:36,143
we have a greater idea!
Am I right?

147
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:40,110
It's time now to give
you the award, my dear.

148
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:45,368
We want to give our son to you
for life, as your reward.

149
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,716
We consider the alliance
sealed, if you don't mind.

150
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:59,512
Mr Chaudhary! I can't
begin to express myself!

151
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:03,752
To think that my daughter will be the
daughter-in-law of a rich household...

152
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:06,761
is something I couldn't
even dream about!

153
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:10,401
Madhuri must've done something
good to deserve this.

154
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,801
Let's discuss the dowry first.

155
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:15,441
Mr Chaudhary! 
Are you talking of dowry?!

156
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:17,736
Of course, I want a dowry!

157
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:21,802
Because dowry is now
part of our culture!

158
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:26,573
Even after 25 years in the city,
I have not forgotten our culture.

159
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:29,486
As part of the dowry...

160
00:12:30,953 --> 00:12:33,928
I want some bitter-gourd,
some green-grams...

161
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:37,193
snake-gourd, a pickle
of green-chillies...

162
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:39,146
and before I end
my meal...

163
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,268
I want a porridge garnished
with dates and dry-fruits!

164
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:50,706
As dowry, I need a meal
that Madhuri has cooked.

165
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:54,665
Fantastic! Your daughter is
good looking and talented!

166
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,567
This food that she
has cooked...

167
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:58,772
will leave me licking my
fingers for years to come!

168
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:02,092
Won't you have a
wedding date fixed, then?

169
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:03,821
I'm not a fool!

170
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:07,972
I even had the wedding date
fixed, before we came here.

171
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:11,812
Tuesday next is considered
to be very auspicious.

172
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:14,457
You have no objections, do you?

173
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:17,886
How can we ?
We are fortunate indeed!

174
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:22,413
Can I've the good-fortune of meeting
my sister's future husband?

175
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:24,990
My sister answered your
questions and won a reward.

176
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:27,133
I will question your son, too...

177
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:31,880
and should he win, 
I will give him my sister in marriage!

178
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:34,892
Certainly! Why not?
Let's go together.

179
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:38,746
I'm grateful to you, Teacher.

180
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:42,113
It's thanks to you that my
son's fortunes have looked up.

181
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:04,201
Your future brother-in-law
is here to meet you!

182
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,770
What do you mean?
- Yes.

183
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:10,004
I've met the girl and
even fixed your wedding.

184
00:14:11,036 --> 00:14:13,641
Have you even decided who
my brother-in-law will be?

185
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,248
I've never let anything
be half-done.

186
00:14:16,685 --> 00:14:17,856
Now look...

187
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:21,304
your brother-in-law wants
to interview you.

188
00:14:21,384 --> 00:14:22,934
An interview?!
- Yes.

189
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:26,661
He's a simpleton
from the countryside.

190
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,522
You must deliberately lose...
which will make him happy.

191
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,174
But I've already
lost out, father.

192
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:35,723
Shreekant!
- Coming over...!

193
00:14:45,424 --> 00:14:46,739
Brother-in-law!

194
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:48,964
What misbehaviour is this?!

195
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:52,841
Not misbehaviour. That is the
tradition of our family!

196
00:14:52,921 --> 00:14:56,095
You look like a film-star!

197
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:58,651
My sister is indeed
very fortunate!

198
00:14:59,038 --> 00:15:00,924
He's my son, after all.

199
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:03,455
But hurry up and ask him
whatever you wish to.

200
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:07,558
My first question is...

201
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:10,970
what would happen, had we
not had the Himalayas?

202
00:15:11,232 --> 00:15:13,363
That's an extremely
stupid question!

203
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:17,478
It's a great question!
Answer him, Amit!

204
00:15:18,182 --> 00:15:21,175
Even the kids know that if
it wasn't for the Himalayas...

205
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,299
foreign powers would have
attacked our country.

206
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:27,710
Wonderful!
You're incomparable!

207
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:29,749
My second question is...

208
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:36,138
what would we have, if
not the Himalayas?

209
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:38,874
What?!
- Of course! Answer me.

210
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:42,021
What would we have,
if not the Himalayas? - What?

211
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:44,758
What would we have,
if not the Swiss Alps?

212
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,312
Had it not been
for the alps...

213
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,592
the cool winds would've ruined
the crops in our nation.

214
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,219
Just as I am being ruined!

215
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:57,033
You're an intelligent man!

216
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:59,443
You score 101 marks
out of 100!

217
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:03,921
My third is question is
a bit tricky. Be careful.

218
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:06,833
What would happen, if we
had not the Swiss Alps?

219
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:12,710
You've trapped him!
Do you have an answer?

220
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:19,798
I give up to you and to...

221
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,285
this chap you've chosen
for my brother-in-law!

222
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:25,316
I don't know the answer!
- I'll explain!

223
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,941
What would Tensingh climb,
if not the Swiss Alps?

224
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,701
Bravo! That's wonderful!

225
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:38,895
What's up? Why are you
winking at me?

226
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,943
What's the mystery all about?
- It's a bad omen actually.

227
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:46,190
A blinking eye is considered
to be inauspicious.

228
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:50,206
And I have both eyes shutting up!
- Must be conjunctivitis!

229
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:54,021
It has spread in the whole city!
Let me put give you some eye-drops.

230
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:56,221
No thank you! You need
the eye-drops actually!

231
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,804
For what is going on in
the name of Swiss Alps...

232
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:02,453
should you cure your eyes,
mine will be fine, too!

233
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:08,039
I spoke of your sight...
and you talk of attitudes!

234
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:10,748
Let's go and eat, Shrikant.

235
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:16,918
Wow! I have yet to eat
something so delicious!

236
00:17:16,998 --> 00:17:20,853
Look! Don't we both
share the same tastes?

237
00:17:21,554 --> 00:17:23,536
Tell me something;
my sister will accompany...

238
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:26,354
your son to London after
the wedding, won't she?

239
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:28,125
But naturally!

240
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:31,605
The couple will live
together after their wedding.

241
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:34,190
Get the Rasagollas for
Shrikant. It's in the fridge.

242
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,683
Maharaj...
- Go and fetch it yourself!

243
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:39,485
Please go and fetch it!

244
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:40,722
Okay.

245
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:47,280
Now listen, son...
I have something to ask you.

246
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,347
Yes. Go on...

247
00:17:48,427 --> 00:17:51,533
I'm told that village folks
bury gold in their courtyard.

248
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:55,373
It's true. I've heard of it, too.

249
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:58,530
In the marriage of
your sister, then...

250
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,365
Listen! Where are the rasagollas ?

251
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:05,450
It's in my room. In my
briefcase, actually.

252
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,494
In your briefcase?
- Yes. Hurry up and fetch it.

253
00:18:10,784 --> 00:18:13,943
Weren't you asking
me something, sir?

254
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:16,545
I was telling you
something, actually.

255
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:19,419
It's a marriage, after all.
It's no joke...

256
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,522
so much of the buried gold does
your sister get in marriage?

257
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,325
You will give her atleast
200 grams of gold, won't you?

258
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,306
200 grams? But of course!

259
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:41,123
I must give her that much...
naturally!

260
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,440
In fact, you can consider
it given to her already!

261
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,708
I'll be back in a minute!

262
00:18:48,622 --> 00:18:52,759
Won't you have the rasagollas ?
- No thank you. I've had enough.

263
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:57,769
Well... have you been
up to your jokes again?

264
00:18:57,849 --> 00:18:59,318
Not at all!

265
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:02,471
I've set the stage for a joke though!

266
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:08,350
What am I to do now?

267
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:10,437
Although it's the question
of my sister's life...

268
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,145
where will I bring
200 grams of gold from?

269
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:15,149
I will have to face
this problem somehow!

270
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:18,189
My sister will surely be
married! She surely will!

271
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:25,033
If it wasn't for
our jokes...

272
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:28,262
life would be so
dull and drab!

273
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:35,224
Jokes and laughter add
years to one's life.

274
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:37,986
Isn't that why both of us
are in the pink of health?

275
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:40,157
Welcome, Shreekant.

276
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:47,814
Do we have a deal, then?
- What is the deal?

277
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:50,543
That one about the 200
grams of gold, of course!

278
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,927
Naturally! It was a deal the
moment you mentioned it!

279
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:57,360
Let's shake then...
Come on!

280
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,066
Give this sari to Madhuri
and tell her...

281
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:04,465
that it's a token of
our affection for her.

282
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:09,511
We're now waiting for
the auspicious moment...

283
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:14,243
when she comes here as
our daughter-in-law.

284
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:48,016
"It's like adding
spice to life..."

285
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:50,381
"when the groom is
fairer than the bride"

286
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:58,200
"The one who steals the heart
is fairer than his bride..."

287
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:06,237
"How do you like them?
Fair-skinned or dark?"

288
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:14,627
"Tell me how you'd like
your husband to be?"

289
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:19,477
"Let me go...
don't pester me"

290
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:30,708
"How do I tell you
or explain..."

291
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:35,025
"my choice is hidden
deep down in my heart"

292
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,056
"It'll be difficult to
woo the fair-skinned one..."

293
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:26,877
"and the dark one will
attract taunts from everyone"

294
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:40,842
"Be he fair-skinned
or dark..."

295
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:44,636
"It is he.
I will have to live with"

296
00:22:44,716 --> 00:22:46,749
"The fair-skinned one
will be an arrogant one..."

297
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:48,675
"while the dark one will
suffer from complexes"

298
00:22:48,755 --> 00:22:52,408
"You will lose your sleep
and be restless"

299
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:56,606
"Do tell me then... what
kind of a husband d'you want?"

300
00:22:56,686 --> 00:23:01,742
"Let me go...
do not pester me"

301
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:06,293
"How do I tell you
or explain this..."

302
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:10,262
"My choice lies hidden
deep down in my heart"

303
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:53,960
"Should he be tall
or short in height?"

304
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,089
"Should he be skinny
or plump like a wrestler?"

305
00:24:07,771 --> 00:24:11,613
"Be he skinny or strong..."

306
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:15,497
"I only hope he is not
evil at heart"

307
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:17,545
"The tall one will
inflict cruelties..."

308
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,446
"the shorter one will
look odd"

309
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:21,433
"How will you take the weight..."

310
00:24:21,513 --> 00:24:23,379
"should you find a fat husband?"

311
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:27,339
"Do tell us then... what kind
of a husband do you want?"

312
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:31,990
"Do let me go... don't pester me"

313
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:36,867
"How do I explain
or tell you..."

314
00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:41,109
"My choice lies in my dreams"

315
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:12,245
"What is this I hear,
my friend..."

316
00:25:12,662 --> 00:25:16,360
"that they've chosen
a city-bred for you?"

317
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,369
"The city-bred have a
colourful nature..."

318
00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:24,258
"They're always chasing
the pretty ones"

319
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:28,284
"I shall turn myself into
what he'd like..."

320
00:25:28,364 --> 00:25:32,023
"and win over my
husband's heart"

321
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:36,230
"What if you slip
and fumble?"

322
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:40,181
"Whom will you tell the
truth, if not to us?"

323
00:25:40,261 --> 00:25:44,004
"Do tell us then...
what husband do you want?"

324
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:49,015
"Let me go!
Don't pester me"

325
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:53,401
"How do I tell you
or explain this?"

326
00:25:53,941 --> 00:25:57,826
"My choice lies hidden
in my dreams"

327
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:08,610
Congratulations on
your wedding!

328
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:11,100
Greetings, Madam.
- Greetings.

329
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:13,550
I have a small gift for you.

330
00:26:15,197 --> 00:26:18,445
Look at it through
my glasses...

331
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:21,440
it's genuine gold.
- You are a jeweller.

332
00:26:21,672 --> 00:26:23,950
Who will bring gold,
if not you?

333
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,319
I guessed the moment I saw
your wife...

334
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:28,611
as to why you suddenly
agreed to the wedding.

335
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:33,112
To be honest, I don't know how
my wife has approved of me!

336
00:26:41,723 --> 00:26:43,881
She's in Nirmal Village!

337
00:26:44,425 --> 00:26:46,888
A bride for you, as
beautiful as gold itself!

338
00:26:47,296 --> 00:26:48,740
She'll be my
daughter-in-law!

339
00:26:56,203 --> 00:26:58,860
Look at Harish!
Isn't he delighted?!

340
00:26:59,505 --> 00:27:02,808
People who don't marry, regret
it all their live, really!

341
00:27:03,131 --> 00:27:05,020
And those who marry
regret it even more!

342
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:08,013
Oh, come on!
- I'm already regretting it.

343
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:10,199
But I'm helpless.

344
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,567
How would a poor goat
face a hungry tiger?

345
00:27:14,826 --> 00:27:16,893
Something wrong, Amit?
You hardly look happy.

346
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:20,750
How'd I be happy especially since
I'm marrying a village-belle?

347
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,517
A village-belle,
do you get it?

348
00:27:24,675 --> 00:27:27,715
Tell me... how can I ever
bring a village-belle...

349
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:30,007
to a gathering of this kind?

350
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:33,468
You can always refuse.
Why get worked up?

351
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:36,641
Refuse, eh?
Refuse my father?!

352
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:39,078
You don't know my old man!

353
00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:41,011
He strides across like
an elephant...

354
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:45,318
watches me like an owl
and roars like a lion!

355
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:50,312
This liquor you're having
is a funny thing, Amit.

356
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:54,038
Two extra drinks could
dwarf a giant!

357
00:27:54,886 --> 00:27:57,053
Have a couple of
quick ones then...

358
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,482
and call it an attack
on your old man!

359
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:37,219
What insolence is this?!

360
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,841
This is a gun...
not insolence!

361
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:49,064
It's loaded with six bullets
which will decide things!

362
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,385
What nonsense are
you talking?

363
00:28:50,465 --> 00:28:52,666
Where've you picked up
that piece of junk from?

364
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:55,247
You're the Junk-seller...

365
00:28:55,488 --> 00:28:58,039
who's saddling me with
all the unwanted things!

366
00:28:58,461 --> 00:29:00,438
You have called me
a junk-seller!

367
00:29:00,635 --> 00:29:03,227
Not even your grandpa
ever called me that!

368
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,856
You, son of my grandpa
in Heaven...

369
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:08,533
prepare to leave
for heaven, too!

370
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,356
Are you going to kill me
with that toy-gun?

371
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:14,191
You'll get a slap from me!

372
00:29:14,443 --> 00:29:17,504
This is no toy!
It's a real pistol!

373
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:26,173
And this last bullet...

374
00:29:26,623 --> 00:29:28,401
will find my father's heart!

375
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:30,738
Should you insist on this marriage...

376
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:32,645
Go ahead and fire! But you
will marry that very girl!

377
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:34,032
No way!
- Of course, you will!

378
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,140
No!
- You will certainly!

379
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:51,308
What have you done, Amit?
How could you do this?

380
00:29:51,563 --> 00:29:53,752
That which I should have
done long ago!

381
00:29:54,638 --> 00:29:57,628
Note down my last wish, Laxmi.

382
00:29:58,285 --> 00:30:00,908
That which must be followed.

383
00:30:01,444 --> 00:30:04,115
lf my last wish is
not adhered to...

384
00:30:04,493 --> 00:30:09,127
my soul will haunt this man
as a ghost, all his life!

385
00:30:10,223 --> 00:30:14,009
Don't say that!
Nothing will happen to you!

386
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:18,169
Very well, Laxmi...
I must leave now.

387
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,618
Forgive me for any wrong
I've done...

388
00:30:24,413 --> 00:30:28,108
I have a regret, though. 
I can't see my son getting married.

389
00:30:33,534 --> 00:30:36,456
Impossible! I can't do it!

390
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:39,762
Looks like I'm surely
going to get married!

391
00:30:57,235 --> 00:30:58,565
Have you got it, teacher?

392
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:02,240
I've looked for you all over,
and here you are.

393
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:08,928
Wow! They look genuine!

394
00:31:09,394 --> 00:31:14,776
If man could help it, he'd even have
fake-men look like real!

395
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:20,382
By the way, which drama are
you staging this festival?

396
00:31:20,648 --> 00:31:21,827
I'm playing Satyavan
Savitri.

397
00:31:21,907 --> 00:31:24,642
I'm going to wear these
ornaments and play the role.

398
00:31:24,722 --> 00:31:28,809
Are preparations for
Madhuri's wedding over?

399
00:31:29,324 --> 00:31:33,468
Should you need help from me,
please don't hesitate.

400
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,633
What more than this
can you do, Teacher?

401
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:41,500
I need God to help me now.

402
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:42,925
Good-bye.

403
00:31:56,861 --> 00:31:59,483
Your bridegroom is here!

404
00:31:59,563 --> 00:32:01,954
It's considered auspicious to
see him before the wedding!

405
00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:26,783
Is the groom blind? He's wearing
dark-glasses even at night!

406
00:32:27,718 --> 00:32:32,230
He's had it, even before
he has set his eyes on her!

407
00:33:02,035 --> 00:33:04,421
Call the bride.
It's time for the vows.

408
00:33:13,626 --> 00:33:15,068
There she is!

409
00:34:56,863 --> 00:35:00,113
Stop showering petals on us!
This marriage will not take place!

410
00:35:00,555 --> 00:35:02,445
What nonsense are you talking?
The vows are over.

411
00:35:02,525 --> 00:35:06,189
No, father! This is no wedding.
It's a joke! A farce!

412
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:09,782
Come to your senses! How can
you retract after the vows...

413
00:35:09,862 --> 00:35:12,479
Such a marriage cannot
be called a marriage, dad!

414
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,771
Why not?

415
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:19,352
You told me that girls from
the village are pure as gold.

416
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:22,835
Then ask the village-belle, why
are they giving us fake gold?

417
00:35:25,527 --> 00:35:29,110
You have always worshipped
people from the villages, dad.

418
00:35:29,615 --> 00:35:31,235
But you can see
for yourself...

419
00:35:31,315 --> 00:35:34,835
how these people have taken
a gullible man for a ride!

420
00:35:35,411 --> 00:35:36,967
When the gold they
give us is fake...

421
00:35:37,498 --> 00:35:39,075
the bride must
be a fake, too!

422
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:43,543
To be honest, I think
everything here...

423
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:45,995
including her brother and
mother, appear to be fake!

424
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:47,995
Especially the brother!

425
00:35:51,514 --> 00:35:55,039
Are the ornaments fake,
Shreekant?

426
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,869
I'll explain this, my son!

427
00:36:06,448 --> 00:36:11,152
I joked with Shreekant that
I wanted 200 grams of gold.

428
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:15,652
And that which is given
in a joke is always fake...

429
00:36:15,732 --> 00:36:16,936
not genuine!

430
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:19,607
You have come to be a
professional joker, dad.

431
00:36:19,772 --> 00:36:22,944
In the process, you were about
to make a mockery of my life!

432
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:25,803
But not anymore!

433
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,080
Should these fake people
still appeal to you...

434
00:36:29,543 --> 00:36:32,350
you can take to them.

435
00:36:32,637 --> 00:36:34,333
You can indulge them
and the fake bride!

436
00:36:35,168 --> 00:36:37,825
Do as you please!
But I'm leaving now.

437
00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:51,547
Sir! Please save us
from ruination!

438
00:36:52,851 --> 00:36:54,680
God alone is the
saviour, son.

439
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,286
But I have made a very
big mistake, too.

440
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:00,911
I didn't know...

441
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:05,127
that a small joke would
lead to such a calamity.

442
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:10,589
That a spark could
ignite a raging fire!

443
00:37:13,037 --> 00:37:15,990
My son is a hot-blooded youth.

444
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:19,306
It'll take him time
to cool down.

445
00:37:19,928 --> 00:37:21,680
But please don't worry.

446
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:25,967
Very soon, I shall take
my daughter-in-law away...

447
00:37:26,381 --> 00:37:27,872
with all due ceremonies
and honour.

448
00:37:28,175 --> 00:37:30,700
This is my promise to you.
Good-bye.

449
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,732
You've saved a friend today.
You've saved me from being ruined.

450
00:37:46,812 --> 00:37:49,609
That's okay. But I'm terribly
angry at your father.

451
00:37:49,689 --> 00:37:52,454
How could he decide anything
without his son's consent?

452
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:54,737
I will decide things for
myself, in the future.

453
00:37:57,955 --> 00:37:59,222
You sinner!

454
00:38:00,547 --> 00:38:03,259
You have ruined your
sister's life!

455
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:10,649
Hit me, mother!
I have sinned!

456
00:38:11,036 --> 00:38:13,007
I have ruined my
sister's life!

457
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:19,160
No! Before you hit him,
you must realise...

458
00:38:19,843 --> 00:38:23,657
that he did it all
for my welfare.

459
00:38:24,154 --> 00:38:25,960
You must forgive him.

460
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:29,841
There's no point in crying
or regretting anything now.

461
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:34,679
A controversy which began
with fake-jewellery...

462
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,241
eventually boiled down to
faces he didn't like.

463
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:41,379
But don't worry, Mom.

464
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,560
If there is sacred
anything in my marriage...

465
00:38:45,321 --> 00:38:48,069
it will break the shackles
of falsehoods...

466
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:52,438
and help me settle down
with my husband one day!

467
00:40:14,674 --> 00:40:17,525
There are women waiting
for the interview, sir.

468
00:40:17,605 --> 00:40:19,038
Have all the ladies arrived?
- Yes, sir.

469
00:40:19,118 --> 00:40:20,938
I'll be there in a moment!

470
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:43,401
My name is Kumar Chatterji.

471
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:46,219
I happen to be the whole
and soul of the company...

472
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:49,386
where nothing moves
without my permission!

473
00:40:49,466 --> 00:40:51,306
So you'd better give me...

474
00:40:51,386 --> 00:40:53,899
all the crucial information
about yourselves.

475
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:59,990
My name is Manju Chaudhary.
I stay at Vakola, Santacruz.

476
00:41:08,651 --> 00:41:12,432
Have you come for the view...
I mean, for the interview?

477
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,740
Yes.
- Please sit down.

478
00:41:15,065 --> 00:41:16,699
Sit here.

479
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:26,323
Can you give me your contact number?
- Why?

480
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:30,633
I might need it in
an emergency, you see!

481
00:41:33,765 --> 00:41:37,091
Let me land the job first.
The contact comes later.

482
00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:41,076
You can consider yourself employed!

483
00:41:48,899 --> 00:41:51,444
Who's the gentleman?
- Our boss!

484
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:54,140
He's the one who will
interview all of you.

485
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:01,432
This is Bhagat here.
- Yes, Mr Bhagat?

486
00:42:01,888 --> 00:42:05,633
I have decided to employ the
Minister's niece as the secretary.

487
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:06,973
She will assume charge on Monday.

488
00:42:07,262 --> 00:42:09,949
But I've summoned many girls
for the interview, sir.

489
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:13,126
What will I say to them?
- Do as you are told, Amit.

490
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,865
This has to do with the
minister's niece.

491
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,469
Have Kumar sent to me.

492
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:28,878
It stops. And...

493
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:32,188
Mr Kumar! The boss wants you inside.

494
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:35,238
See? Nothing moves here
without my permission!

495
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:37,244
Excuse me, I'll just be back.

496
00:42:40,913 --> 00:42:44,238
Did you send for me?
- Yes. Go and cancel the interviews.

497
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:47,414
I get it! You must've got
a call from the M.D. !

498
00:42:47,494 --> 00:42:51,865
Sure. You're a smart guy!
Now go and call off the interviews.

499
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:53,769
And see that none of them
takes offence.

500
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:58,460
Don't worry, sir! I've called off
so many interviews... in the past!

501
00:43:08,632 --> 00:43:09,603
Ladies!

502
00:43:11,448 --> 00:43:13,630
I have bad news!

503
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:18,098
My boss received a call
from his doctor just now.

504
00:43:18,899 --> 00:43:22,400
And that which he feared
has turned out to be true!

505
00:43:22,637 --> 00:43:24,069
What's wrong with him?

506
00:43:24,607 --> 00:43:27,486
He's suffering from
a cancer of the piles!

507
00:43:29,763 --> 00:43:31,751
Strange are God's ways!

508
00:43:32,104 --> 00:43:37,081
Such a tall and handsome man,
fair and broad-chested...

509
00:43:37,258 --> 00:43:41,289
suffering from cancer...
that too, of piles!

510
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,276
Please convey our
best wishes to him!

511
00:43:43,524 --> 00:43:46,303
That's a contagious disease!
Let's return.

512
00:43:50,703 --> 00:43:52,314
Haven't you left, Madam.

513
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:57,234
No, sir. Because I want
to rush you to the hospital.

514
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:03,574
I'm sure it's you who has
the cancer, not your boss.

515
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:08,417
Hats off to you, madam!
You're a smart one!

516
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,458
But I'm no less.

517
00:44:10,538 --> 00:44:14,763
So let me tell you what
the man inside has cooked.

518
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:18,158
Our boss received a call
from a superior...

519
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,340
to employ someone
he favours.

520
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,170
Which is why I had to
fake the illness.

521
00:44:22,549 --> 00:44:24,985
But you...
you're incomparable!

522
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:28,412
But I promise to set you up
the moment I get the chance!

523
00:44:29,058 --> 00:44:31,060
You're an interesting
man, too.

524
00:44:51,078 --> 00:44:54,407
My name is Malti Chaudhary.
I came here for the interview.

525
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:58,223
But your assistant said that
you're suffering from cancer.

526
00:44:58,303 --> 00:44:59,454
What?

527
00:44:59,749 --> 00:45:02,854
Cancer?! Who? Me?!
He's a bloody liar!

528
00:45:03,057 --> 00:45:06,835
Of course! All the girls prayed
for you, before they left.

529
00:45:07,373 --> 00:45:09,885
But I stayed back
to find out...

530
00:45:10,057 --> 00:45:12,105
the nature of the cancer
afflicting you.

531
00:45:12,344 --> 00:45:15,618
Is it the cancer of bribes?
Of employing a relative?

532
00:45:15,698 --> 00:45:17,826
Or is it the cancer
of influence?

533
00:45:18,037 --> 00:45:20,290
What exactly is the nature
of your cancer?

534
00:45:20,474 --> 00:45:22,937
You are accusing me.

535
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,550
I will expose the truth behind
your so called interviews!

536
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:31,216
I will take this story of
deceit to the newspapers!

537
00:45:31,497 --> 00:45:34,382
Let people know how
rich people like you...

538
00:45:34,462 --> 00:45:37,578
take advantage of
the deprived class!

539
00:45:38,473 --> 00:45:41,948
It's sad that I haven't even
got to tell you that...

540
00:45:42,028 --> 00:45:46,312
I've practiced hard to improve
my typing speed to 80 wpm.

541
00:45:46,392 --> 00:45:47,922
I have won a distinction
in shorthand...

542
00:45:48,002 --> 00:45:50,446
and I've topped in my course
of Secretarial Practice.

543
00:45:51,441 --> 00:45:53,236
But I will not spare you!

544
00:45:58,347 --> 00:46:02,605
Stop the girl who has walked
out of my office.

545
00:46:02,685 --> 00:46:03,968
And come inside immediately.

546
00:46:15,124 --> 00:46:19,689
Mr Bhagat? A girl just stormed
into my office.

547
00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:22,214
She has threatened to expose
us all in the newspapers.

548
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,486
This thing about employing the
minister's niece...

549
00:46:25,566 --> 00:46:26,938
can give us a bad name.

550
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:28,906
Okay. Thank you.

551
00:46:31,548 --> 00:46:33,589
Give the girl her
appointment letter.

552
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,986
You're a great man, sir.
- And you're a cheap guy!

553
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:44,869
If you lie ever again, you
will discover my greatness!

554
00:46:45,045 --> 00:46:47,421
You are a great man,
no doubt.

555
00:46:47,501 --> 00:46:49,567
But by employing the girl...

556
00:46:49,647 --> 00:46:54,081
you have driven away
my disappointment!

557
00:47:03,213 --> 00:47:04,860
You're done!
- What?!

558
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,211
Naturally! With someone
like me for a fan....

559
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:11,868
everything had to pale
into insignificance!

560
00:47:12,252 --> 00:47:15,483
After I lectured the
boss about you...

561
00:47:15,715 --> 00:47:17,859
he begged at my feet!

562
00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:19,706
Please employ her,
he said!

563
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:23,150
And so... here's your
appointment letter.

564
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:30,183
Listen... this is important.

565
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:32,476
We will be working
together, no doubt.

566
00:47:32,556 --> 00:47:41,213
But if I may be able to help you
economically or physically...

567
00:47:41,293 --> 00:47:44,224
I'll be pleased to oblige,
and so will you!

568
00:47:44,304 --> 00:47:45,304
Pardon me?

569
00:47:46,836 --> 00:47:47,780
Very well.

570
00:47:51,392 --> 00:47:53,813
Very well indeed!

571
00:48:34,097 --> 00:48:37,280
Sister! How are you?
- I'm fine.

572
00:48:37,431 --> 00:48:38,760
Careful!

573
00:48:40,035 --> 00:48:41,167
How did it go?

574
00:48:42,015 --> 00:48:43,757
I'll tell you...
- What happened?

575
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,695
Just what I wanted.
I have got the job.

576
00:48:46,775 --> 00:48:47,777
What?!

577
00:48:47,857 --> 00:48:50,721
Have you got a job as
his private secretary?!

578
00:48:50,918 --> 00:48:53,764
Yes!
- Didn't he recognise you?!

579
00:48:55,193 --> 00:48:59,518
No. He hasn't still got rid
of his dark-glasses.

580
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:04,174
All this has happened
because of me, isn't it?

581
00:49:04,783 --> 00:49:07,587
Hadn't I done something
so foolish that day...

582
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:12,690
you'd have been living
peacefully with your husband.

583
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:15,079
Stop cribbing and crying!

584
00:49:15,682 --> 00:49:18,093
All you did was to care for
your sister's well-being!

585
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:21,358
I need your help right now.

586
00:49:22,222 --> 00:49:25,470
I can't succeed in this
drama without your help.

587
00:49:26,394 --> 00:49:27,466
You will help me, won't you?

588
00:49:27,546 --> 00:49:32,566
I'd do more than laying
down my life for you, sis.

589
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:36,236
It won't come to that,
God-willing.

590
00:49:40,152 --> 00:49:44,779
Look at Madhuri going!
- She's got the city airs!

591
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:47,463
The high-heeled sandals,
the swaying gait...

592
00:49:47,543 --> 00:49:49,575
And look carefully!

593
00:49:49,655 --> 00:49:52,302
She has even wiped out the
matrimonial vermillion!

594
00:49:52,382 --> 00:49:55,056
There's no dearth of
vermillion in Bombay...

595
00:49:55,136 --> 00:49:57,273
nor that of people who'd
be interested in her!

596
00:49:57,353 --> 00:49:59,635
Look at her ways!

597
00:50:01,171 --> 00:50:02,931
The Bombay-bird indeed!

598
00:50:08,808 --> 00:50:10,014
Have some tea, dear.

599
00:50:20,949 --> 00:50:22,568
Why are you looking
at me like this, mom?

600
00:50:23,131 --> 00:50:24,495
It's nothing, dear.

601
00:50:26,844 --> 00:50:31,393
I know what you have to go
through, for my sake, mom.

602
00:50:31,886 --> 00:50:33,627
You have to put up
with a lot of jibes.

603
00:50:33,707 --> 00:50:38,168
How far have you gone away
from our culture, Madhuri?

604
00:50:39,847 --> 00:50:43,447
You have even wiped away
the matrimonial vermillion!

605
00:50:46,948 --> 00:50:49,675
Of what use is
the vermillion...

606
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,250
that returned after
reaching my forehead?

607
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:55,218
If there is any strength in
my belief of my marriage...

608
00:50:55,455 --> 00:50:57,990
the vermillion will return
to my forehead one day!

609
00:51:03,085 --> 00:51:07,142
Your son-in-law is the
boss of the company...

610
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:10,372
where I've been employed.

611
00:51:10,769 --> 00:51:14,363
Really? Hasn't he
recognised you, then?

612
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:18,172
No. He's just been
introduced to me.

613
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:20,815
He'll get to know
me very soon, too.

614
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:25,063
I only need
your blessings now.

615
00:51:26,665 --> 00:51:30,827
O Goddess Mother! Just as You can be
pleased and angry with your devotees...

616
00:51:31,205 --> 00:51:33,549
Your devotees have the
right to...

617
00:51:33,972 --> 00:51:36,570
be angry and happy
with You, too.

618
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:40,778
I'm terribly angry with You
for what You've done to us!

619
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:43,172
My son has been married...

620
00:51:43,493 --> 00:51:45,285
but my daughter-in-law
hasn't come home!

621
00:51:45,365 --> 00:51:47,373
I will not pray to You
till such time...

622
00:51:47,718 --> 00:51:50,400
as Madhuri comes here
as my daughter-in-law!

623
00:52:15,076 --> 00:52:17,017
Do come...

624
00:52:23,248 --> 00:52:26,260
Have you never been in love?

625
00:52:26,732 --> 00:52:29,758
I want a rose with fragrance and
you bring me one that stinks!

626
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:31,566
D'you want one that has
more fragrance than this?

627
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:35,028
I'll get it for you.
But do talk to me!

628
00:52:35,108 --> 00:52:36,923
Sure... No!

629
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:40,007
Go outside and attend to
the forward and backward... - What?

630
00:52:40,087 --> 00:52:41,494
I mean, the inward and
outward correspondence!

631
00:52:41,574 --> 00:52:44,671
That's what I'm always doing!
What a bore!

632
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,908
How often have I told you
not to call me Uncle ?

633
00:53:15,894 --> 00:53:19,862
What do I call an uncle,
if not Uncle?

634
00:53:19,942 --> 00:53:24,199
Don't you try to act
smart with me...!

635
00:53:24,279 --> 00:53:26,714
And if you must really
call someone uncle...

636
00:53:26,794 --> 00:53:29,009
you can always call
Anthony that!

637
00:53:33,463 --> 00:53:35,309
The score's 30
for no loss, sir!

638
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,245
What was he saying?
- He asked me to call you uncle!

639
00:53:47,169 --> 00:53:52,555
I always steal a rose from
the neighbour's garden...

640
00:53:53,074 --> 00:53:56,903
brave the ferocious dog there
and bring it to you!

641
00:53:58,663 --> 00:54:00,005
It's beautiful, isn't it?

642
00:54:00,506 --> 00:54:03,265
But although I have presented
you with 25 roses...

643
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:06,585
I have still to win over
your heart!

644
00:54:12,027 --> 00:54:13,848
I always spray a perfume
on it...

645
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:16,030
so its fragrance
never wears off.

646
00:54:16,904 --> 00:54:22,154
But alas! The fragrance
of my love...

647
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:24,716
never reaches your
beautiful nose!

648
00:55:34,703 --> 00:55:37,567
That's a beautiful rose!
- Isn't it?

649
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,887
Who brought it?
- I did.

650
00:55:40,594 --> 00:55:41,952
It's a strange thing,
isn't it...

651
00:55:42,163 --> 00:55:44,960
that the rose always smells
of different perfumes.

652
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:52,003
Brut, Charlie, Sex Appeal,
Henna...

653
00:55:52,278 --> 00:55:55,553
Henna? That's right!

654
00:55:55,888 --> 00:55:59,540
I love roses!
So does my mother.

655
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,970
And she'd love to meet you.

656
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:05,839
So why don't you come over
to my place next Sunday?

657
00:56:05,919 --> 00:56:08,764
But don't tell Boss
about it.

658
00:56:09,149 --> 00:56:13,420
He's a good man.
But he's dull and boring.

659
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,897
He knows nothing of romance
and wouldn't understand this!

660
00:56:20,756 --> 00:56:23,019
We have an urgent meeting to attend.
- Go ahead, sir.

661
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:24,909
You will come along, too!
- I?

662
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:26,189
Come on!

663
00:56:34,996 --> 00:56:36,748
The lady is here, sir.

664
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:44,118
I'm going out.

665
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:47,531
There are some papers in the
file which I want you to type.

666
00:56:48,766 --> 00:56:49,772
There's another thing.

667
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:51,382
I'm happy with your work.

668
00:56:52,272 --> 00:56:54,842
But you'd better not waste
time in unnecessary things.

669
00:58:28,334 --> 00:58:30,838
I'm sorry, but I didn't
notice you coming.

670
00:58:30,918 --> 00:58:33,778
How would you? You were busy
admiring the photograph.

671
00:58:34,147 --> 00:58:35,769
Is that your boyfriend?

672
00:58:39,214 --> 00:58:42,423
He's a boy, all right.
But he's still not a friend.

673
00:58:43,674 --> 00:58:44,730
He's my boss, actually.

674
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:46,620
It's a cakewalk for you,
in that case!

675
00:58:48,104 --> 00:58:51,263
Men are usually
very careless.

676
00:58:51,874 --> 00:58:56,039
If they find someone taking
proper care of them...

677
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:59,003
they could even make
good husbands!

678
00:58:59,793 --> 00:59:02,194
In any case, a beautiful
girl like you...

679
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,575
can be had only by a very
fortunate man!

680
00:59:06,419 --> 00:59:10,943
Here's your rent.

681
00:59:12,574 --> 00:59:15,068
Mark my words.

682
00:59:15,531 --> 00:59:18,852
This boss will one day
be a slave to you!

683
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:20,428
Just you watch!

684
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:24,868
Care for some tea?

685
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:27,696
Don't bother about bringing it.
I'll fetch it myself!

686
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:30,159
Here's a set of
handkerchiefs, sis.

687
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:32,539
I've bought them with the
salary I've received.

688
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:35,499
Tell me something.

689
00:59:35,862 --> 00:59:38,677
You're normally scolding me
for being careless...

690
00:59:38,757 --> 00:59:41,028
and not looking
after my things.

691
00:59:41,326 --> 00:59:45,053
But where have you lost
your hanky today?

692
01:00:35,301 --> 01:00:37,154
Have you sent for me, sir?
- Yes.

693
01:00:37,641 --> 01:00:39,797
I wanted to thank you.
Do sit down.

694
01:00:39,877 --> 01:00:41,556
May I fetch a pad if you
want to dictate a letter?

695
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:47,996
Have you ever met
a careless man?

696
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,190
What? Oh yes, I have...
I'm meeting one right now.

697
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:53,383
Me, you mean?

698
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:56,680
I wonder when I'll
stop being so careless.

699
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,767
You have considered my cabin
as your own...

700
01:00:59,847 --> 01:01:02,085
and cleaned out all the mess.

701
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:09,464
But your carelessness can
lead to a setback.

702
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:13,738
You could lose something
precious, out of carelessness.

703
01:01:13,818 --> 01:01:15,614
Won't that be a pity?

704
01:01:16,281 --> 01:01:19,553
Your cabin was in bad shape.
Especially your files.

705
01:01:19,633 --> 01:01:21,638
I remembered it from my
very first day here.

706
01:01:21,718 --> 01:01:23,685
No matter what you
remember...

707
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:25,614
but you also have
a very bad memory.

708
01:01:25,984 --> 01:01:27,109
Pardon me?

709
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:32,282
You've forgotten something, too.
- Have you remembered it then?

710
01:01:32,669 --> 01:01:36,267
Naturally. How can I forget
something I possess?

711
01:01:38,607 --> 01:01:40,428
What are you staring
at me for?

712
01:01:40,508 --> 01:01:45,390
It's the handkerchief
that you forgot!

713
01:01:48,109 --> 01:01:49,495
Excuse me...
- Yes?

714
01:01:49,575 --> 01:01:52,060
You're participating in the
badminton matches this time.

715
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:53,545
Why don't we have
a match, too?

716
01:01:56,307 --> 01:01:59,278
I always lose miserably,
while you're a champion.

717
01:01:59,728 --> 01:02:01,294
Who told you that I am a champion?

718
01:02:01,514 --> 01:02:02,926
Everybody in the office knows it.

719
01:02:03,006 --> 01:02:06,284
Okay. But one who wins
can always lose...

720
01:02:06,364 --> 01:02:07,714
and the loser might
even win a game.

721
01:02:07,794 --> 01:02:10,433
Let's a question of playing and
you must have a match with me.

722
01:02:12,035 --> 01:02:14,085
You can consider me game.

723
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,588
You?! What are you
doing here?

724
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:33,776
Funny! But I was about to ask
you the same question.

725
01:02:34,145 --> 01:02:36,883
Are you to here to
make a match with someone?

726
01:02:36,963 --> 01:02:39,791
Not to make a match...
but to play one!

727
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:42,548
Am I not a loyal man, sir?

728
01:02:42,628 --> 01:02:46,784
I've come all the way to
watch you play goodminton !

729
01:02:47,452 --> 01:02:49,370
Goodminton? What on earth is that?

730
01:02:49,997 --> 01:02:52,697
When a super-player like
you plays bad-minton...

731
01:02:52,777 --> 01:02:54,981
it's bound to earn the
name of good-minton !

732
01:02:59,133 --> 01:03:00,473
Welcome, Ms Malti!

733
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:02,980
The shuttlecock is here!

734
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,536
Get cracking, sir!

735
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,148
What are you doing here?
- I came here for the fragrance.

736
01:03:12,228 --> 01:03:15,370
But since you are here, you bring
the spring with you!

737
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:17,316
Should we start the game?

738
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:19,994
What d'you think, Mr Kumar?
Should we start?

739
01:03:20,074 --> 01:03:24,523
Why are you asking him?!
- Get cracking, the two of you!

740
01:03:24,603 --> 01:03:28,001
The ideal moment of the day!

741
01:03:28,081 --> 01:03:31,324
Get, set and go!

742
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:36,018
How'd he get here?
- I wouldn't know!

743
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:40,927
Who's into service, sir?
- Service?

744
01:03:41,007 --> 01:03:42,816
Who'll serve first?

745
01:03:46,504 --> 01:03:47,903
Let's get started!

746
01:04:27,815 --> 01:04:30,851
You've lost a love-game!

747
01:04:30,931 --> 01:04:33,705
Oh no! He's the champ.

748
01:04:33,913 --> 01:04:35,867
He lost because
he wanted me to win.

749
01:04:35,947 --> 01:04:40,775
You have a heart then?
I wear it on my sleeve!

750
01:04:40,986 --> 01:04:44,726
Keep your promise now and
treat us to some Chinese food.

751
01:04:44,806 --> 01:04:46,062
That's a good idea!
Let's go.

752
01:04:46,142 --> 01:04:49,184
But you don't eat Chinese
food, do you?

753
01:04:49,264 --> 01:04:52,047
How about your allergy?

754
01:04:52,466 --> 01:04:54,478
Anyway, thanks for the game.
I must leave now.

755
01:04:54,854 --> 01:04:56,857
Keep this, sir.
You can play with it!

756
01:05:00,006 --> 01:05:02,558
It's good that you
called me over, madam.

757
01:05:02,638 --> 01:05:05,619
Or they use badminton
as an excuse for rape!

758
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:08,956
The other day, a sixty-year
old woman was lured...

759
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:52,685
Why did you plant the
cauliflower in my cabin?

760
01:05:52,918 --> 01:05:55,960
The roses are always passed
on to the other girl!

761
01:05:56,297 --> 01:06:00,499
You can have this cauliflower
and give her some, too!

762
01:06:00,852 --> 01:06:03,092
If I had to give her
vegetables, why would...

763
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:05,079
I give her a cauliflower?

764
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:08,833
I could give her bananas,
bitter-gourd or anything!

765
01:06:10,346 --> 01:06:13,259
Give anything you wish!
To hell with it!

766
01:06:14,314 --> 01:06:15,939
I wonder where
they come from!

767
01:06:17,288 --> 01:06:18,373
Come in.

768
01:06:19,505 --> 01:06:20,933
The score is 340 runs for
9 wickets, sir.

769
01:06:21,013 --> 01:06:24,169
Did I ask you for the score?
Go and fetch me a flower.

770
01:06:24,249 --> 01:06:27,559
What file, sir?
- Not file! A flower! A rose!

771
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:29,853
What colour?
- A red one will do!

772
01:06:29,933 --> 01:06:32,653
One like your cheek...
No! Like mine!

773
01:06:33,161 --> 01:06:34,580
Here's the money.
Hurry up.

774
01:06:38,243 --> 01:06:40,723
I'll personally give her
a rose today.

775
01:06:43,692 --> 01:06:45,707
Welcome, Mr Kumar.

776
01:06:45,892 --> 01:06:47,649
What perfume does your
rose have today?

777
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,648
But this is the first time
I've brought you a rose!

778
01:06:52,701 --> 01:06:55,542
Now look; you bring me
a rose everyday.

779
01:06:55,885 --> 01:06:59,757
Why don't you admit that?
I haven't turned it down, have I?

780
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:03,819
Yes, I bring one everyday.
You like roses, don't you?

781
01:07:03,899 --> 01:07:07,609
Yes. I love them. Where do you
bring such beautiful roses from?

782
01:07:07,769 --> 01:07:09,810
I steal them!
- Speak softly!

783
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:10,355
Why?

784
01:07:10,435 --> 01:07:13,610
What if someone hears you?
- I'm not scared of anyone!

785
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:15,528
But I'm scared.
- Of whom?

786
01:07:15,718 --> 01:07:16,439
The boss, of course.

787
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:18,533
The boss?

788
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:24,448
Tell you what? Put the
rose in my hair...

789
01:07:24,528 --> 01:07:27,346
and return to your cabin.
Okay?

790
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,511
When will you meet me again?

791
01:07:46,032 --> 01:07:49,225
Tonight?
- Tonight?! Where is that?

792
01:07:49,305 --> 01:07:52,806
In your dreams.
- Dreams?

793
01:07:53,179 --> 01:07:55,119
Wonderful! That's the best place!

794
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:57,494
Neither will the evil
boss hound us...

795
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,214
nor will the fat girl
be around!

796
01:07:59,294 --> 01:08:02,341
Just you and me...
just the two of us!

797
01:08:08,637 --> 01:08:10,555
Sit down, Mr Kumar.

798
01:08:11,496 --> 01:08:13,505
I've got to ask you some
important questions.

799
01:08:14,144 --> 01:08:17,074
I've already put in 10 years
of service in this company.

800
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:19,019
Do you intend to interview me
all over again?

801
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:20,700
Yes. You could say that.

802
01:08:20,964 --> 01:08:24,552
How many branches do we
have all over the country?

803
01:08:25,023 --> 01:08:26,392
22 branches.
- We have 23.

804
01:08:27,076 --> 01:08:29,831
We are starting a new branch
on the Nicobar Islands.

805
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:34,318
You mean, the one called
Andaman and Nicobar Islands?

806
01:08:34,398 --> 01:08:35,974
Fantastic! Congratulations!

807
01:08:36,054 --> 01:08:38,641
Ever since you've joined the
systems and communications...

808
01:08:38,721 --> 01:08:40,336
our company is making
great progress!

809
01:08:41,222 --> 01:08:44,500
Congratulations to you, too.
- Thank you. But what for?

810
01:08:44,824 --> 01:08:46,495
You have been given
a promotion.

811
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:49,996
Have I? Thank you very much.

812
01:08:50,959 --> 01:08:54,356
You are being appointed
manager of the new branch.

813
01:08:55,813 --> 01:08:58,457
The new branch at
Nicobar?

814
01:08:58,655 --> 01:09:01,163
You mean, I'll have
to go there?!

815
01:09:01,243 --> 01:09:03,640
We need a responsible
man there.

816
01:09:03,831 --> 01:09:05,967
And who could be more
responsible than you are?

817
01:09:06,151 --> 01:09:08,472
You have been
misinformed, sir!

818
01:09:08,552 --> 01:09:11,409
I am the most irresponsible man in
the organisation! It's the truth!

819
01:09:11,489 --> 01:09:12,939
How can you say that?

820
01:09:13,143 --> 01:09:14,902
Although our office opens
at 10.00...

821
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:17,823
you usually walked in
at 11 or 11.30 a.m.

822
01:09:18,016 --> 01:09:19,915
But nowadays, you are here
on the dot at 9.30 a.m.!

823
01:09:20,223 --> 01:09:22,299
That too, with
a rose in hand!

824
01:09:22,695 --> 01:09:27,657
You've worked wonders with our
systems and communications!

825
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:33,496
But isn't Nicobar Island
very far away, sir?

826
01:09:33,913 --> 01:09:36,641
That's okay. You won't
be swimming across anyway.

827
01:09:36,721 --> 01:09:38,039
We'll give you an
air-ticket instead.

828
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:40,424
Even out there, you will
have no real problems.

829
01:09:40,767 --> 01:09:42,967
Although you will not
find any roses around...

830
01:09:43,047 --> 01:09:44,691
there are girls aplenty.

831
01:09:44,946 --> 01:09:47,814
Of the man-eating variety!

832
01:09:52,071 --> 01:09:54,737
I'd gladly be a peon
in this office!

833
01:09:54,992 --> 01:09:57,139
But please don't banish me
to Nicobar, sir!

834
01:09:57,618 --> 01:10:00,095
I'll be ruined, sir!

835
01:10:00,464 --> 01:10:03,228
There's a condition.
...No more roses!

836
01:10:13,124 --> 01:10:14,016
Malti?

837
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:18,351
Sit down.

838
01:10:19,785 --> 01:10:21,360
Let's begin with
the dictation.

839
01:10:28,707 --> 01:10:30,616
What was he doing to you
behind the glass-panel?

840
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:36,044
He was putting a rose
in my hair, sir.

841
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:38,173
A rose? I see!

842
01:10:44,555 --> 01:10:47,270
I've written that, sir.
- Really? Let's proceed...

843
01:10:48,062 --> 01:10:50,596
Did he cuddle up to you
in the cab?

844
01:10:52,285 --> 01:10:53,376
Yes.

845
01:11:00,405 --> 01:11:03,605
What else did he do to you
in the cab? Did he talk a lot?

846
01:11:04,245 --> 01:11:06,954
Yes, he did.

847
01:11:07,355 --> 01:11:10,602
He told me that I look very
beautiful in a pink sari.

848
01:11:10,968 --> 01:11:13,205
He's right!
You do look beautiful!

849
01:11:21,803 --> 01:11:23,382
How far did he take you
in the cab?

850
01:11:24,445 --> 01:11:27,525
Far... far away.
-Very far.

851
01:11:28,045 --> 01:11:31,598
He wanted to take me home
to meet his mother.

852
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:35,205
He has no parents!
They are dead!

853
01:11:35,511 --> 01:11:38,492
That's how he lures gullible
girls into visiting his house!

854
01:11:39,954 --> 01:11:43,129
And then... have you seen
the film Insaaf Ka Tarazu?

855
01:11:43,789 --> 01:11:45,285
Yes, I have. So?

856
01:11:45,452 --> 01:11:50,854
So it's... rape...
twice in succession!

857
01:11:52,492 --> 01:11:54,599
And then?
- It's the Courts!

858
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:04,869
But I've already jotted
that down, sir.

859
01:12:20,972 --> 01:12:22,309
You will have to
concede my request.

860
01:12:22,389 --> 01:12:25,092
My mother has sent some
special food for you.

861
01:12:25,769 --> 01:12:26,971
Your mother has?
- That's right.

862
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,399
She's a great cook!
Check it out for yourself!

863
01:12:30,335 --> 01:12:32,131
I don't doubt that.
But...

864
01:12:33,027 --> 01:12:34,251
Has someone poisoned
your ears against me?

865
01:12:34,331 --> 01:12:36,291
No...

866
01:12:36,371 --> 01:12:39,731
In that case, you must
try the food.

867
01:12:39,811 --> 01:12:43,049
That's a request from me
as well as my mother!

868
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:54,611
Sit down.

869
01:13:03,964 --> 01:13:07,201
What will you have?
- Anything you wish.

870
01:13:09,854 --> 01:13:11,209
How's the restaurant?

871
01:13:15,118 --> 01:13:16,592
You choose the menu today.

872
01:13:19,405 --> 01:13:22,358
A vegetable-rice, a steamed
potato-dish...

873
01:13:22,966 --> 01:13:28,284
a radish-pancake, and
a seasoned lentil-curry.

874
01:13:30,766 --> 01:13:32,084
Listen...
- Yes.

875
01:13:32,526 --> 01:13:35,416
Also include a dish
of bitter-gourd.

876
01:13:36,889 --> 01:13:38,189
Something wrong?

877
01:13:38,859 --> 01:13:43,037
Except for the bitter-gourd,
we have common tastes!

878
01:13:46,366 --> 01:13:49,492
Do you know, when I saw you
for the first time...

879
01:13:50,834 --> 01:13:53,008
Where was that?
- At the interview, of course.

880
01:13:53,843 --> 01:13:59,413
I had a feeling that I had
met you somewhere.

881
01:14:00,209 --> 01:14:03,398
Where could that be?
- In my dreams, perhaps.

882
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:07,823
You could really
have met me earlier...

883
01:14:07,903 --> 01:14:11,875
and forgotten me like
a bad dream?

884
01:14:13,164 --> 01:14:16,217
Perhaps. But I won't
ever forget you now.

885
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:23,914
What are you doing?
Won't you eat?

886
01:14:23,994 --> 01:14:25,305
You finish your food first.

887
01:14:25,385 --> 01:14:27,233
That's the worst thing
about Hindu women!

888
01:14:27,313 --> 01:14:29,992
Like my mother, for instance.
They serve others first...

889
01:14:30,072 --> 01:14:31,964
and themselves eat later.
That's not fair.

890
01:14:32,967 --> 01:14:34,474
Who else do you have
in the family?

891
01:14:34,554 --> 01:14:37,145
It's just my parents and me.
- Is that all?

892
01:14:37,523 --> 01:14:40,762
Why? Must I have more?

893
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:46,083
I see what you are
getting at. But, no...

894
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:57,012
I'm surprised that even after
so many years in England...

895
01:14:57,425 --> 01:14:59,404
you still haven't forgotten
your old customs.

896
01:15:00,531 --> 01:15:02,613
I haven't forgotten
anything, except...

897
01:15:03,077 --> 01:15:05,202
for some terrible memories
that I want to forget.

898
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:45,214
Thank you, O Lord!

899
01:15:45,579 --> 01:15:47,215
Did you see that?
- See what?

900
01:15:47,659 --> 01:15:49,579
Amit has been whistling!

901
01:15:50,459 --> 01:15:54,628
It's a whistle of joy
and happiness...

902
01:15:54,963 --> 01:15:56,978
that which spells melody!

903
01:15:57,274 --> 01:16:00,235
It's after 2 years that
Amit has whistled again!

904
01:16:00,939 --> 01:16:04,459
Do you understand?
- No, I don't. Please explain.

905
01:16:05,557 --> 01:16:07,297
You're an ignorant man.

906
01:16:07,747 --> 01:16:11,732
Don't you remember Amit
whistling all the while...

907
01:16:11,812 --> 01:16:13,729
even as he walked,
talked and ate?

908
01:16:14,935 --> 01:16:18,045
Since the wedding, however, he
forgot his favourite whistle.

909
01:16:18,612 --> 01:16:20,596
And he has been
whistling today!

910
01:16:20,837 --> 01:16:23,394
Which means he is
truly delighted!

911
01:16:23,691 --> 01:16:25,442
This is when I must
talk to him...

912
01:16:25,522 --> 01:16:28,595
about bringing our
daughter-in-law home!

913
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:35,823
My son...
- Yes, Mom?

914
01:16:36,378 --> 01:16:39,578
I'm delighted to see
you happy today.

915
01:16:40,257 --> 01:16:43,785
On this happy occasion then,
I've something to say to you.

916
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,911
Sure. Go ahead, Mom.
- Can we bring Madhuri home?

917
01:16:48,302 --> 01:16:50,901
I've forgotten the past.

918
01:16:51,174 --> 01:16:52,963
I can't be blamed if it
continues to haunt you.

919
01:16:53,043 --> 01:16:55,948
It isn't my fault either for
remembering the past.

920
01:16:56,493 --> 01:16:59,508
I can't help it, if you
have a bad memory.

921
01:17:04,529 --> 01:17:05,649
Do you get the point?

922
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,189
When a young man whistles
after a gap of 2 years...

923
01:17:09,481 --> 01:17:11,383
it has to be for an
altogether new woman!

924
01:17:18,888 --> 01:17:20,059
Come closer...

925
01:17:24,763 --> 01:17:27,132
Why are you feeling shy?

926
01:17:29,529 --> 01:17:32,969
Not at all. Why would I
come to you, if I were shy.

927
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:35,520
But your eyes say
something else.

928
01:17:36,136 --> 01:17:38,096
I wish you'd look into them.

929
01:17:41,882 --> 01:17:43,546
Your hand is freezing.

930
01:17:55,429 --> 01:17:57,783
What's wrong?
- I've swallowed a mosquito!

931
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:43,819
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

932
01:18:44,148 --> 01:18:48,089
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

933
01:18:48,169 --> 01:18:51,816
"I'm afraid, someone
might see us"

934
01:18:51,902 --> 01:18:55,886
"We meet here, away
from prying eyes"

935
01:18:55,966 --> 01:18:59,726
"I'm afraid, someone
might see us"

936
01:19:00,074 --> 01:19:01,508
"A little bit of fear..."

937
01:19:01,588 --> 01:19:03,778
"and the overpowering
magic of love"

938
01:19:04,086 --> 01:19:05,476
"A little bit of fear..."

939
01:19:05,556 --> 01:19:07,992
"and the overpowering
magic of love"

940
01:19:08,072 --> 01:19:11,686
"Meeting on the sly
has its own charm"

941
01:19:12,097 --> 01:19:15,982
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

942
01:19:16,062 --> 01:19:20,007
"But I'm afraid...
someone might spot us"

943
01:19:34,804 --> 01:19:41,611
"No one recognise us here
in this isolated place"

944
01:19:42,274 --> 01:19:49,552
"But our hearts would still
be lonely, meeting on the sly"

945
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:09,864
"The fear in your eyes
and the anxiety within"

946
01:20:09,944 --> 01:20:13,609
"The fear in your eyes
and the anxiety within"

947
01:20:13,903 --> 01:20:17,799
"Meeting on the sly
has its own charm"

948
01:20:52,497 --> 01:20:55,920
"What a great weather"

949
01:20:56,466 --> 01:20:59,856
"And the intoxicating winds..."

950
01:20:59,936 --> 01:21:03,416
"I've been longing for you"

951
01:21:03,496 --> 01:21:07,334
"Oh, do sate my thirst"

952
01:21:23,394 --> 01:21:27,195
"We can always meet again;
why make haste?"

953
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,193
"We can always meet again;
why make haste?"

954
01:21:31,273 --> 01:21:34,946
"Meeting on the sly has
its own charm, after all"

955
01:21:35,428 --> 01:21:39,359
"Let's continue to meet
away from prying eyes"

956
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:43,297
"But we're afraid,
someone might see us"

957
01:22:14,627 --> 01:22:21,722
"Where would these longing
hearts go anyway"

958
01:22:22,056 --> 01:22:29,626
"The world is anyway
against lovers"

959
01:22:45,648 --> 01:22:49,488
"Let's hide from them...
but don't hide love from me"

960
01:22:49,568 --> 01:22:53,488
"Making love on the sly
has its own charm, too"

961
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:57,100
"What do we gain from
meeting on the sly"

962
01:22:57,482 --> 01:23:00,952
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

963
01:23:01,493 --> 01:23:05,359
"But we're afraid,
someone might see us"

964
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:09,270
"Let's romance openly
if we must"

965
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:13,028
"Let's romance openly
if we must"

966
01:23:13,379 --> 01:23:17,286
"Why fear the world
when we've fallen in love"

967
01:23:17,366 --> 01:23:20,794
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

968
01:23:21,307 --> 01:23:25,223
"I'm afraid, someone
might spot us here"

969
01:23:25,303 --> 01:23:28,944
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

970
01:23:29,024 --> 01:23:32,709
"I'm afraid, someone
might spot us here"

971
01:23:32,789 --> 01:23:36,518
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

972
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:40,547
"I'm afraid, someone
might spot us here"

973
01:23:40,627 --> 01:23:45,017
"Here we meet...
away from prying eyes"

974
01:24:09,632 --> 01:24:11,754
I've told you a thousand
times that you're...

975
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:13,256
making the wrong entries!

976
01:24:13,336 --> 01:24:18,205
The right total is 53987.
And you write 33987.

977
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:20,474
Doesn't that make a
difference of 20000?

978
01:24:21,258 --> 01:24:24,634
There's someone
to see you, sir.

979
01:24:24,714 --> 01:24:26,489
When I asked him to sit
at the reception...

980
01:24:26,569 --> 01:24:28,674
he insisted on waiting
in your cabin.

981
01:24:28,754 --> 01:24:30,565
He claimed to be
a relative of yours.

982
01:24:30,645 --> 01:24:34,208
You've caught a cold, sir.
Would you want a pill?

983
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:36,794
So, haven't I told you...

984
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:44,354
You've caught a cold.
Would you want a pill...

985
01:24:44,434 --> 01:24:46,354
That's not necessary.

986
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:51,593
What is it?

987
01:24:57,001 --> 01:24:58,396
I'll go and pop a pill!

988
01:25:34,766 --> 01:25:36,825
Where's the guy you said
was waiting for me?

989
01:25:37,154 --> 01:25:39,754
That's what I'm wondering!
Where could he be...?

990
01:25:40,688 --> 01:25:41,794
There he is!

991
01:25:41,874 --> 01:25:43,504
What have you been doing
in my toilet?

992
01:25:44,696 --> 01:25:45,764
I'll leave now.

993
01:25:46,969 --> 01:25:48,774
Greetings, brother-in-law!

994
01:25:49,142 --> 01:25:52,854
Now tell me what would we have,
if not the Himalayas?

995
01:25:52,934 --> 01:25:54,130
Himalayas, my foot!

996
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:56,087
And keep standing!
Don't sit down!

997
01:25:56,778 --> 01:25:58,405
Are not well?
- I've caught a cold.

998
01:25:58,485 --> 01:25:59,549
You shouldn't be shouting.

999
01:25:59,629 --> 01:26:03,112
I wanted to know when you're taking
my sister away, brother-in-law.

1000
01:26:03,481 --> 01:26:06,350
To begin with, stop
calling me brother-in-law!

1001
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:08,443
Okay, brother-in-law...
- There you go again!

1002
01:26:08,523 --> 01:26:11,363
I've come to you with hopes,
brother-in-law.

1003
01:26:11,443 --> 01:26:15,078
I thought I'd meet you and
have a chat with you!

1004
01:26:15,158 --> 01:26:17,210
That I'd have something
to drink!

1005
01:26:17,858 --> 01:26:19,554
But never mind...

1006
01:26:19,634 --> 01:26:23,517
I'll go and show these
pictures to your parents.

1007
01:26:25,496 --> 01:26:27,438
There's no point in tearing
them! I have the negatives!

1008
01:26:27,785 --> 01:26:30,512
Do you think you can
blackmail me with this?

1009
01:26:30,675 --> 01:26:32,956
Go ahead and show them to
my parents! I don't care!

1010
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:37,257
Sure, I'll go away. But
I won't stop tailing you!

1011
01:26:37,337 --> 01:26:38,889
Not there! This way out!

1012
01:26:48,933 --> 01:26:50,836
I have learnt something
absolutely explosive!

1013
01:26:51,312 --> 01:26:53,143
Really? What is it?

1014
01:26:53,603 --> 01:26:55,155
I will tell you
when the time comes.

1015
01:26:55,345 --> 01:26:57,255
Whom is it about?

1016
01:26:57,989 --> 01:27:01,887
It's about the boss,
Mr Amit Chaudhary.

1017
01:27:04,878 --> 01:27:08,144
But I will tell you only
when the time comes!

1018
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:11,924
The right time, my foot!

1019
01:27:22,803 --> 01:27:24,706
What's wrong?
Aren't you well?

1020
01:27:24,786 --> 01:27:26,676
I think I have a fever.

1021
01:27:26,756 --> 01:27:28,384
You're running
a high temperature.

1022
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:32,501
Come on, get up.
- Yes madam.

1023
01:27:33,231 --> 01:27:34,421
Take this bag away.

1024
01:27:35,316 --> 01:27:37,639
Go home and relax.
- Who'll complete my work?

1025
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,793
I will.
- Okay.

1026
01:27:40,498 --> 01:27:42,741
But call me at home, if
you have any problems.

1027
01:27:59,459 --> 01:28:01,992
Who is this girl?

1028
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:04,165
That's precisely what
I want to ask you.

1029
01:28:04,578 --> 01:28:07,614
I hope you haven't got
your son married again!

1030
01:28:07,965 --> 01:28:09,936
What do you mean?
- I mean...

1031
01:28:10,016 --> 01:28:14,815
this girl was clinging
to your son as if she were his wife!

1032
01:28:15,329 --> 01:28:16,751
What are you talking about?

1033
01:28:16,831 --> 01:28:18,601
They were having a ball
in the seas...

1034
01:28:18,681 --> 01:28:21,734
and were even singing
a duet!

1035
01:28:22,015 --> 01:28:23,774
We meet on the sly,
away from prying eyes

1036
01:28:23,854 --> 01:28:26,123
We're afraid, someone
might see us

1037
01:28:29,187 --> 01:28:32,681
You should be ashamed
to accuse my son!

1038
01:28:34,201 --> 01:28:35,829
Although you are visiting
us after a long time...

1039
01:28:36,163 --> 01:28:38,786
I will not enquire
after your health!

1040
01:28:38,866 --> 01:28:41,081
But I want to know what
insolent behaviour is this?

1041
01:28:41,301 --> 01:28:44,687
I will not tell you about
my welfare either.

1042
01:28:44,864 --> 01:28:46,385
And this is no insolence!

1043
01:28:46,465 --> 01:28:50,428
I've taken pictures
to back my claim!

1044
01:28:51,107 --> 01:28:52,844
It's Amit.
- Of course.

1045
01:28:52,924 --> 01:28:55,952
Who's the girl?
- It's his private secretary.

1046
01:28:56,032 --> 01:28:58,512
Miss Malti Chaudhary.
- How do you know that?

1047
01:28:59,932 --> 01:29:01,921
I had been to his office.

1048
01:29:02,699 --> 01:29:05,426
But he even refused
to acknowledge me!

1049
01:29:05,602 --> 01:29:07,841
Didn't he acknowledge you?!
- Yes, he didn't!

1050
01:29:07,921 --> 01:29:09,922
And he threw me out,
short of pushing me!

1051
01:29:10,002 --> 01:29:11,430
He dare do that!

1052
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:14,623
It's good that he
didn't push you out.

1053
01:29:15,074 --> 01:29:17,037
Or I'd have thrown him
out of the house!

1054
01:29:17,117 --> 01:29:21,807
You live up to my expectations!
- How is our daughter-in-law?

1055
01:29:24,198 --> 01:29:26,247
How do I tell you?

1056
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:30,338
She's miserable, thinking of
your son all the time!

1057
01:29:31,167 --> 01:29:33,407
Her hair is unruly
and uncombed...

1058
01:29:33,487 --> 01:29:35,212
her cheeks are dry!

1059
01:29:35,486 --> 01:29:37,607
Her eye-balls seem eager to
pop out of the sockets!

1060
01:29:37,687 --> 01:29:41,176
And she goes around the
village in a trance!

1061
01:29:41,256 --> 01:29:43,687
And she cries and
wants to know...

1062
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:46,282
why her husband
has deserted her!

1063
01:29:46,816 --> 01:29:51,763
He will come, won't he?
Won't he accept me she asks!

1064
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:59,003
Hey, stop it....
Don't cry.

1065
01:29:59,433 --> 01:30:04,747
Stop crying, Shreekant!
He will certainly accept her!

1066
01:30:06,287 --> 01:30:10,173
I will deal with the ass now!

1067
01:30:11,232 --> 01:30:17,206
If I don't impose a curfew
on his love-affair...

1068
01:30:17,426 --> 01:30:19,737
I won't claim to be
a good husband!

1069
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:22,517
Go on now and continue
playing the private-eye.

1070
01:30:22,730 --> 01:30:28,167
Let me know, if you
smell something fishy.

1071
01:30:28,604 --> 01:30:35,559
Only you can save my sister's
life from ruination, sir!

1072
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:40,036
Or your son is making
attempt to destroy her!

1073
01:30:40,538 --> 01:30:44,077
I must leave now.
Good-bye!

1074
01:30:51,429 --> 01:30:56,127
Why did you attend office,
when you aren't keeping well?

1075
01:30:56,418 --> 01:30:59,311
How'd I have met you, if
I didn't attend office?

1076
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:04,010
You don't have to attend
office till I come, too.

1077
01:31:04,090 --> 01:31:07,836
How can I possibly
bunk office?

1078
01:31:07,916 --> 01:31:11,993
Very well. But do call me
from the office.

1079
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:15,221
You will call me, won't you?
- Sure, I will.

1080
01:31:25,117 --> 01:31:26,437
What will happen now.

1081
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:29,397
A wedding.
- What?

1082
01:31:30,018 --> 01:31:33,291
If Amit loves that girl, he'll
surely want to marry her.

1083
01:31:33,371 --> 01:31:35,078
I'll throw him out of
the house for that!

1084
01:31:35,613 --> 01:31:36,951
The ant has sprouted wings!

1085
01:31:39,498 --> 01:31:41,957
That sounds like Amit's car.
But at this hour?

1086
01:31:52,532 --> 01:31:56,719
There's a girl with Amit.
Can you see?

1087
01:31:56,799 --> 01:31:59,202
How can I? I'm not
wearing my glasses!

1088
01:31:59,282 --> 01:32:01,771
I can't see properly
without my glasses either.

1089
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:05,033
But I'm sure it's
the same wretch!

1090
01:32:16,679 --> 01:32:18,135
What's wrong, son?

1091
01:32:18,901 --> 01:32:21,457
You're running a temperature!
Come along quickly...

1092
01:32:21,855 --> 01:32:26,109
Lie down on the bed.

1093
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:33,682
Call the doctor.
My condition is worsening.

1094
01:32:33,762 --> 01:32:35,217
Yes, I will.

1095
01:32:36,154 --> 01:32:38,718
But who was the girl
with you, Amit?

1096
01:32:40,068 --> 01:32:42,637
It was my secretary.

1097
01:32:42,835 --> 01:32:47,098
She came to drop me home,
because I wasn't well.

1098
01:32:48,621 --> 01:32:52,119
You could have called
us over to fetch you.

1099
01:32:55,412 --> 01:32:57,186
Greetings, sir.
The keys.

1100
01:32:57,497 --> 01:32:59,747
Who was the girl, Biharilal?

1101
01:33:03,149 --> 01:33:04,684
Who was she?

1102
01:33:05,033 --> 01:33:07,359
It was Miss Malti.
The master's private.

1103
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:11,195
Private what?
- His private secretary.

1104
01:33:11,979 --> 01:33:14,092
What were they discussing
in the car?

1105
01:33:15,343 --> 01:33:18,560
Don't feel shy. Tell us what
they were talking about.

1106
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,923
I couldn't hear them well.

1107
01:33:21,003 --> 01:33:24,998
But the master called her
by the name Darjeeling.

1108
01:33:25,192 --> 01:33:28,007
Could they be going
to Darjeeling then?

1109
01:33:28,087 --> 01:33:30,131
Shut up! You're an idiot!

1110
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:33,085
He's called her a darling!

1111
01:33:33,638 --> 01:33:36,532
Did you see anything
for yourself, Biharilal?

1112
01:33:36,612 --> 01:33:41,406
I could watch them in the
rear-view mirror, madam.

1113
01:33:41,844 --> 01:33:46,103
The young master lay in
the girl's lap!

1114
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:52,350
The lady was muttering
sweet-nothings to him...

1115
01:33:52,878 --> 01:33:56,925
while the master's
temperature kept increasing...

1116
01:33:57,005 --> 01:34:00,960
and I kept feeling
embarrassed!

1117
01:34:01,245 --> 01:34:06,700
What happened then?
- The master then gave it to her.

1118
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:08,397
What?
- Two time.

1119
01:34:08,477 --> 01:34:09,715
Twice kissed.

1120
01:34:09,795 --> 01:34:11,365
Gave what?
- Don't you understand?

1121
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:15,125
Your son has kissed her!

1122
01:34:17,238 --> 01:34:19,912
She dare do that!
- How's the girl to blame?

1123
01:34:19,992 --> 01:34:21,557
It was your son
who kissed her!

1124
01:34:21,637 --> 01:34:24,763
The question is why did she
allow him to kiss her?

1125
01:34:25,516 --> 01:34:29,480
And why did this idiot
watch them kissing?!

1126
01:34:30,045 --> 01:34:34,365
Let me deal with you,
you peeping-tom...

1127
01:34:38,772 --> 01:34:42,512
Who's Malti Chaudhary
in this office?

1128
01:34:42,592 --> 01:34:43,902
Malti?

1129
01:34:45,313 --> 01:34:48,139
Who are you, sir?
- And who are you?

1130
01:34:48,775 --> 01:34:51,499
Kumar Chatterji, the chief
accountant of this company.

1131
01:34:51,579 --> 01:34:52,742
Chief accountant?
- Yes.

1132
01:34:52,822 --> 01:34:54,814
My name is
Sadanand Chaudhary.

1133
01:34:55,522 --> 01:35:01,159
The boss's father?
Greetings, sir.

1134
01:35:01,239 --> 01:35:02,942
I want to meet
Malti Chaudhary.

1135
01:35:03,097 --> 01:35:05,317
She's in her cabin.
Please follow me.

1136
01:35:11,934 --> 01:35:15,889
She seems to have
gone out on some work.

1137
01:35:15,969 --> 01:35:19,998
But do sit inside
and wait for her.

1138
01:35:23,201 --> 01:35:25,298
Please sit down.
You too, madam.

1139
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:28,840
I want to ask you
something, Chatterji.

1140
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:31,998
I'll explain everything
without any questions.

1141
01:35:32,078 --> 01:35:34,259
I've spread the word of
your son's love-affair...

1142
01:35:34,339 --> 01:35:36,219
in the whole city!

1143
01:35:37,717 --> 01:35:38,975
Since when has this
affair been going on?

1144
01:35:39,055 --> 01:35:40,686
Since it began, sir.

1145
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:43,535
And when did it begin?
- Since it got going.

1146
01:35:44,341 --> 01:35:46,197
That woman, who has
enticed my son,...

1147
01:35:46,277 --> 01:35:48,499
has she been into this sort
of a thing even earlier?

1148
01:35:48,977 --> 01:35:51,991
You're mistaken, madam.

1149
01:35:52,355 --> 01:35:53,851
There's nothing wrong
with the girl.

1150
01:35:54,141 --> 01:35:56,419
In fact, she was madly
in love with me.

1151
01:35:56,895 --> 01:35:58,555
It was your son Amit...

1152
01:35:59,059 --> 01:36:02,525
who threatened me with a
transfer to Nicobar Islands...

1153
01:36:02,789 --> 01:36:04,601
and won the game by
unfair means!

1154
01:36:06,442 --> 01:36:09,031
It is I who will send the
girl to the back-waters!

1155
01:36:09,773 --> 01:36:13,222
You will be happy to know,
Mr Chatterjee, that...

1156
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:17,068
I'm not against occasionally
beating up silly women!

1157
01:36:17,332 --> 01:36:18,660
Am I not right?
- Nonsense!

1158
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:21,061
It's always the men
who are at fault!

1159
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,615
It's they who deserve a thrashing!
- You're right, madam!

1160
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:27,105
It's the boss who ought
to be beaten up!

1161
01:36:27,422 --> 01:36:30,185
As for Malti Chaudhary...
I'll handle her myself!

1162
01:36:30,677 --> 01:36:31,812
Well, all right.

1163
01:36:32,327 --> 01:36:35,984
Do warn Malti Chaudhary then,
that if she doesn't relent...

1164
01:36:36,366 --> 01:36:37,761
I'll make life difficult
for her!

1165
01:36:52,097 --> 01:36:54,367
What are you weighing
in the scale?

1166
01:36:54,607 --> 01:36:56,681
The pros and cons,
naturally!

1167
01:36:57,549 --> 01:36:58,984
Won't you listen to me?

1168
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:04,412
My in-laws visited the
office today.

1169
01:37:04,936 --> 01:37:06,224
And from what I've heard...

1170
01:37:06,792 --> 01:37:09,483
they're longing for their
daughter-in-law.

1171
01:37:12,138 --> 01:37:14,061
I don't like this anymore!

1172
01:37:14,645 --> 01:37:16,900
Tell me, Shreekant...

1173
01:37:17,673 --> 01:37:20,806
why must we punish them,
when they are innocent?

1174
01:37:21,184 --> 01:37:23,919
You are right!

1175
01:37:24,209 --> 01:37:25,924
What do you mean?
- All I mean is that...

1176
01:37:26,004 --> 01:37:29,178
had you not been secretary
to him, someone else would.

1177
01:37:29,416 --> 01:37:30,719
And whoever she
might have been,...

1178
01:37:30,799 --> 01:37:32,805
she'd have weighed
heavier on his mind!

1179
01:37:33,138 --> 01:37:35,512
Somewhat like this!

1180
01:37:37,291 --> 01:37:41,754
You have the upper hand today
because he's smitten by you.

1181
01:37:43,687 --> 01:37:47,128
Or else, he'd have fallen
for another woman by now.

1182
01:37:49,969 --> 01:37:51,921
Let's continue with the game.

1183
01:37:52,529 --> 01:37:55,622
There are many days and
nights yet to come.

1184
01:37:56,302 --> 01:37:57,886
There's a lot to speak about.

1185
01:38:11,374 --> 01:38:13,614
Is the driver here, Ramu?
- Yes, sir.

1186
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:15,290
But the Master's
taking the car away.

1187
01:38:15,370 --> 01:38:16,629
Where to?
- Nirmal Village.

1188
01:38:16,709 --> 01:38:17,394
Chandanpur?
- Yes.

1189
01:38:17,474 --> 01:38:20,482
Yes. I suggest you take
leave, and accompany us.

1190
01:38:20,562 --> 01:38:22,307
What for?
- To bring your wife home.

1191
01:38:22,542 --> 01:38:24,240
What's made you decide
this, all of a sudden?

1192
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,342
It wasn't sudden.
We made the decision...

1193
01:38:26,422 --> 01:38:28,321
only after hearing a lot and
seeing it for ourselves, too!

1194
01:38:28,401 --> 01:38:30,604
Sure. Go ahead.

1195
01:38:30,684 --> 01:38:33,560
I must attend the office
to check the accounts.

1196
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:36,109
I've already checked that out
at your office yesterday!

1197
01:38:36,374 --> 01:38:38,884
They don't speak highly of
you; in fact, you're infamous!

1198
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:41,501
You'd better correct that or
the company stands to lose a lot!

1199
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:45,748
We'll go ahead, if you
don't want to come along.

1200
01:38:45,828 --> 01:38:46,828
Let's go.

1201
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:52,453
Daughter-in-law, my foot!

1202
01:39:07,834 --> 01:39:11,691
What are you dressed in?
- I want to marry you!

1203
01:39:11,961 --> 01:39:14,014
What?!
- Yes! Right now!

1204
01:39:15,068 --> 01:39:19,001
Right now? But I'd have to
seek my parents' consent.

1205
01:39:19,367 --> 01:39:22,525
Introduce me to them.
Everything's going haywire!

1206
01:39:22,605 --> 01:39:25,820
Haywire?!
- Yes! I can't wait anymore!

1207
01:39:26,331 --> 01:39:28,255
Won't you seek the blessings
of your own parents, then?

1208
01:39:28,547 --> 01:39:31,080
I'll manage with your
parents' blessings!

1209
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:32,690
So when are you introducing
me to them?

1210
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:36,728
I'd have to find them, I guess...
- Find them?!

1211
01:39:36,808 --> 01:39:40,026
They must've gone shopping.
But I'll find them.

1212
01:39:40,106 --> 01:39:44,008
I'll come at 6 this evening
to meet them then, okay?

1213
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:56,537
Have you spent the night
at the office, sir?

1214
01:39:57,058 --> 01:40:00,005
Why are you in your
night-dress, sir?

1215
01:40:03,912 --> 01:40:08,032
Your in-laws have gone to the village
to bring you home?

1216
01:40:08,747 --> 01:40:10,766
And your husband is
coming here...

1217
01:40:10,846 --> 01:40:12,818
to meet your so-called
parents, right?

1218
01:40:13,111 --> 01:40:14,747
What will we do now?

1219
01:40:15,243 --> 01:40:19,410
lf both secrets are out,
all hell will break loose!

1220
01:40:22,721 --> 01:40:24,202
Don't worry!

1221
01:40:24,282 --> 01:40:27,743
I suggest you handle
your husband.

1222
01:40:27,823 --> 01:40:31,756
You're a great actress anyway!

1223
01:40:32,399 --> 01:40:36,199
And I'll handle the
problem in the village.

1224
01:40:36,279 --> 01:40:38,926
What do you think of that?
- That's okay.

1225
01:40:39,006 --> 01:40:40,941
But where will I find
a fake-Mom from?

1226
01:40:41,021 --> 01:40:44,390
There's a solution
to every problem!

1227
01:40:44,470 --> 01:40:47,522
When everything in the city
is available on hire...

1228
01:40:47,602 --> 01:40:49,862
won't we find a pair
of parents?

1229
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:00,512
Please come...

1230
01:41:03,991 --> 01:41:05,319
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1231
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:08,566
Kantibhai! He has arrived!

1232
01:41:15,862 --> 01:41:16,997
Greetings...

1233
01:41:20,144 --> 01:41:21,807
How are you?

1234
01:41:23,619 --> 01:41:31,273
Where has she gone....?
She's a strange woman!

1235
01:41:31,898 --> 01:41:34,915
Kantibhai...!

1236
01:41:34,995 --> 01:41:37,607
Where the hell are you?

1237
01:41:43,711 --> 01:41:46,782
Where are you?

1238
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:04,502
They appear to be brother and sister.
And where are your parents?

1239
01:42:04,582 --> 01:42:08,519
They're are my parents!
My mother is a Gujarati...

1240
01:42:08,599 --> 01:42:11,180
which is why she addresses
him as bhai (brother).

1241
01:42:11,918 --> 01:42:13,994
Are you a Guajarati then?
- Yes.

1242
01:42:14,074 --> 01:42:16,642
My Mom is Guajarati;
my father is a Bengali.

1243
01:42:23,822 --> 01:42:25,071
Greetings!
-Greetings!

1244
01:42:25,151 --> 01:42:28,402
Do sit down...
-Please sit.

1245
01:42:29,348 --> 01:42:30,755
Sit on this chair.

1246
01:42:42,298 --> 01:42:43,670
Evening is all right!

1247
01:42:45,219 --> 01:42:48,694
You're just as my daughter
described you!

1248
01:42:48,774 --> 01:42:51,122
Tall and fair-skinned;
those blue eyes...

1249
01:42:51,202 --> 01:42:54,156
they remind me of
film-star Raj Kapoor!

1250
01:42:55,757 --> 01:42:58,337
Our daughter is no less!

1251
01:42:58,739 --> 01:43:01,428
She's fair-skinned
and beautiful...

1252
01:43:01,508 --> 01:43:03,490
a real princess!

1253
01:43:07,179 --> 01:43:10,457
D'you know what is
special about you?

1254
01:43:10,910 --> 01:43:16,609
It's your moustache!
it's real, isn't it?

1255
01:43:16,689 --> 01:43:18,989
Of course! As real
as yours !

1256
01:43:21,211 --> 01:43:23,167
Mine are real, too!

1257
01:43:23,247 --> 01:43:25,638
That's because my wife
loves a moustache!

1258
01:43:25,807 --> 01:43:29,097
Undoubtedly! A moustache
spells masculinity.

1259
01:43:29,643 --> 01:43:33,962
I married Kantibhai only
because he had a moustache.

1260
01:43:34,154 --> 01:43:37,269
And since you have a moustache, too
my daughter has approved of you!

1261
01:43:37,582 --> 01:43:39,469
We will certainly give you
our daughter in marriage!

1262
01:43:39,814 --> 01:43:41,678
But you will be a responsible
man, won't you?

1263
01:43:41,758 --> 01:43:43,974
Of course! I will!

1264
01:43:44,789 --> 01:43:46,590
How much of a bank-balance
do you have?

1265
01:43:47,161 --> 01:43:48,570
My bank-balance? What for?

1266
01:43:49,048 --> 01:43:52,158
It has to do with responsibilities.
Only a moustache won't do!

1267
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:56,417
I must have about
3 or 3.5 lakh Rupees.

1268
01:43:56,497 --> 01:43:58,922
Not 4.5 lakh Rupees?
- Sure. Must be.

1269
01:44:02,815 --> 01:44:06,425
He has about 4.5 lakh Rupees.
We can easily ask for 80000 Rupees!

1270
01:44:06,505 --> 01:44:09,640
No! We need a lakh!
- Let's settle for 80000!

1271
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:13,013
Well okay. One lakh, it will be.
- A lakh? What could that mean?

1272
01:44:13,204 --> 01:44:17,540
A lakh must be paid, since you're
marrying our daughter.

1273
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:19,810
No thank you! I will
not accept a penny!

1274
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:23,930
Not accept! You will have
to pay us a lakh instead!

1275
01:44:28,983 --> 01:44:30,052
Pay you?!

1276
01:44:30,132 --> 01:44:33,311
As dowry. How can there be
a marriage without dowry?

1277
01:44:33,391 --> 01:44:35,352
This is a totally
wrong system!

1278
01:44:35,432 --> 01:44:37,342
On the contrary, you
ought to be happy...

1279
01:44:37,422 --> 01:44:40,280
that I'm willing to marry your
daughter without any dowry.

1280
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:42,432
And here you are... asking me
to pay the dowry!

1281
01:44:44,262 --> 01:44:46,571
What are you talking
about, Mom?!

1282
01:44:46,651 --> 01:44:49,125
We're marrying since
we love each other!

1283
01:44:50,991 --> 01:44:55,642
Haven't we toiled to
bring you up, my dear?

1284
01:44:56,489 --> 01:44:59,172
Do you wish to light up your
house after your marriage...

1285
01:44:59,446 --> 01:45:01,402
and plunge our home
in darkness?

1286
01:45:01,873 --> 01:45:03,548
A lakh of Rupees!
- A lakh?

1287
01:45:03,942 --> 01:45:06,360
Or 50 thousand cash and 200
gram gold.

1288
01:45:06,754 --> 01:45:08,823
If have then give it or get go.

1289
01:45:08,903 --> 01:45:13,616
Radhe Shyam Jhunghun's son has ready
to give 2 lakh rupees for our daughter.

1290
01:45:13,696 --> 01:45:15,313
Am I right, darling?
- Yes.

1291
01:45:17,641 --> 01:45:21,090
It's a very reasonable deal!
Grab it!

1292
01:45:21,512 --> 01:45:25,081
That's not much for love, is it?
- Do you believe that, too?

1293
01:45:25,651 --> 01:45:29,606
Actually, to accept dowry is
considered a social crime.

1294
01:45:29,874 --> 01:45:32,583
Besides, we love each other.

1295
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:35,716
We'll give you a 10/o
discount, in that case.

1296
01:45:37,405 --> 01:45:40,882
I know it's a crime to
ask for dowry, son.

1297
01:45:40,962 --> 01:45:44,845
I know that very well
because I'm a woman!

1298
01:45:45,141 --> 01:45:49,104
I know how the cancer of
dowry is destroying us!

1299
01:45:49,553 --> 01:45:52,292
Our parents are coerced
into paying dowry!

1300
01:45:52,372 --> 01:45:55,304
And thereafter begins
a sage of atrocities!

1301
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:59,647
What is that for? Because men
consider women to be worth nothing!

1302
01:45:59,727 --> 01:46:04,419
You think women are weak
and helpless parasites!

1303
01:46:04,499 --> 01:46:08,352
But it's not true!
We will prove otherwise!

1304
01:46:10,415 --> 01:46:15,384
We will prove that women are
not weak and helpless!

1305
01:46:15,464 --> 01:46:18,358
Long live, Women's Lib!

1306
01:46:25,262 --> 01:46:26,188
Well, all right!

1307
01:46:26,268 --> 01:46:29,984
Please give me some time
to think it over.

1308
01:46:33,938 --> 01:46:36,442
Listen to me, darling.

1309
01:46:36,522 --> 01:46:38,961
Don't take offence at what
my parents said!

1310
01:46:39,041 --> 01:46:44,082
Don't take offence?! Your father's
a butcher, as far as money goes!

1311
01:46:45,490 --> 01:46:48,744
How can I help it?
That's how all parents are!

1312
01:46:48,824 --> 01:46:52,343
Why I can't figure this out is
because ours is a different case!

1313
01:46:52,423 --> 01:46:56,512
There's no money
in a love-marriage!

1314
01:46:56,829 --> 01:47:00,184
You don't know my old man!
He wouldn't part with a penny!

1315
01:47:00,264 --> 01:47:01,959
But if you want to
marry me...

1316
01:47:02,039 --> 01:47:04,125
you'll have to agree to the
conditions of my parents.

1317
01:47:04,205 --> 01:47:06,882
I suggest you find
a part-time job.

1318
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:09,101
I? A part-time job?

1319
01:47:09,533 --> 01:47:12,744
They're the only parents I have!

1320
01:47:12,824 --> 01:47:14,651
Besides, what don't people do in love?

1321
01:47:15,190 --> 01:47:17,138
Can't you do even
this much for me?

1322
01:47:18,103 --> 01:47:20,705
Sure, I will. I will have to!

1323
01:47:46,348 --> 01:47:48,560
Where could they have gone?
- How would I know!

1324
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:50,738
Mr Chaudhary?! Greetings!

1325
01:47:51,234 --> 01:47:53,425
What brings you here?

1326
01:47:54,795 --> 01:47:56,956
Where have they gone,
Teacher?

1327
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,070
How do I narrate their
tale of woes.

1328
01:47:59,150 --> 01:48:02,289
Ever since that
shameful day...

1329
01:48:03,028 --> 01:48:05,395
Madhuri and her mother
left the village for good.

1330
01:48:05,475 --> 01:48:07,028
For good?!

1331
01:48:07,108 --> 01:48:09,125
After the humiliation they
were subjected to...

1332
01:48:09,205 --> 01:48:11,122
they chose to leave
the village.

1333
01:48:11,202 --> 01:48:13,215
They should have died
of shame, actually!

1334
01:48:13,295 --> 01:48:17,008
No! Please don't say that!
Shreekant called on us in the city.

1335
01:48:17,088 --> 01:48:18,916
But he didn't tell us
a word of this.

1336
01:48:20,913 --> 01:48:25,259
See the lock your jokes
have put on the door!

1337
01:48:25,593 --> 01:48:28,645
Do you have the keys
to unlock it then?

1338
01:48:28,988 --> 01:48:31,276
It will never open again!

1339
01:48:31,672 --> 01:48:33,053
You can open locks
made of iron...

1340
01:48:33,133 --> 01:48:36,613
but never one that opens
the doors to the hearts!

1341
01:49:03,493 --> 01:49:04,619
Come on out.

1342
01:49:08,912 --> 01:49:12,212
What farce is
Shreekant playing?

1343
01:49:12,292 --> 01:49:14,350
My daughter's in-laws have
returned from our door!

1344
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:19,136
They had once returned because
their son asked them to.

1345
01:49:19,717 --> 01:49:22,280
And they return today,
since your son wants them to.

1346
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:23,930
Let's go inside.

1347
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:28,294
Thanks a lot, Teacher.

1348
01:49:32,991 --> 01:49:36,985
I was looking for you!
Here's a bouquet!

1349
01:49:37,363 --> 01:49:38,762
What's up?

1350
01:49:38,973 --> 01:49:42,598
How have got to the bouquet
from a single rose?

1351
01:49:42,678 --> 01:49:46,858
For what the boss has done,
you deserve a bouquet!

1352
01:49:46,938 --> 01:49:49,917
And I also want to
congratulate you!

1353
01:49:49,997 --> 01:49:52,160
What for?
- I'll explain.

1354
01:49:54,747 --> 01:49:58,512
Amit has lost! I've won the day! 
And you're a free bird!

1355
01:49:58,776 --> 01:50:00,891
I wasn't a captive earlier, was I?

1356
01:50:00,971 --> 01:50:04,122
It is something of the sort.
I'll explain. Sit down.

1357
01:50:06,255 --> 01:50:10,371
Amit wanted to imprison
you in a marriage...

1358
01:50:10,451 --> 01:50:13,371
and wanted to have
all the fun by himself!

1359
01:50:13,451 --> 01:50:16,331
But his plans have flopped!
D'you know why?

1360
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:19,716
Because he's already
a married man!

1361
01:50:20,217 --> 01:50:23,033
His brother-in-law came here
to meet him the other day.

1362
01:50:23,113 --> 01:50:25,771
And without even divorcing
the village belle...

1363
01:50:25,851 --> 01:50:28,173
the rascal's trying to
lure you into wedlock!

1364
01:50:29,128 --> 01:50:32,145
We are both free now!

1365
01:50:32,225 --> 01:50:36,930
The love-story that had
just begun will now blossom!

1366
01:50:37,010 --> 01:50:41,293
But remember! I will not
spare the hypocrite!

1367
01:50:42,059 --> 01:50:44,866
I am throwing a party
tomorrow to expose him!

1368
01:50:44,946 --> 01:50:47,716
And on the occasion of his
fourth wedding anniversary...

1369
01:50:47,796 --> 01:50:50,416
you will see how the
guests ridicule him!

1370
01:50:52,607 --> 01:50:54,288
What are you getting
angry at me for?

1371
01:50:54,368 --> 01:50:58,537
You should be angry
with the fraud, who...

1372
01:51:00,974 --> 01:51:03,462
I'm coming over.

1373
01:51:08,830 --> 01:51:11,180
Let's continue playing
the game, sister.

1374
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:13,925
There's a lot more
yet to come.

1375
01:51:14,373 --> 01:51:16,230
A lot more to discuss.

1376
01:51:20,946 --> 01:51:22,788
"What was he in reality..."

1377
01:51:22,868 --> 01:51:27,491
"and what did I take him for"

1378
01:51:34,581 --> 01:51:41,158
"How could I revere
a stone-hearted man?"

1379
01:51:41,238 --> 01:51:43,314
"What was he in reality"

1380
01:51:43,394 --> 01:51:47,618
"And what did take him for"

1381
01:52:08,544 --> 01:52:15,074
"All he wanted to do was
to play with my feelings"

1382
01:52:18,512 --> 01:52:24,442
"All he wanted to do was
to play with my feelings"

1383
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:31,277
"And I thought I was
betrothed to him for life"

1384
01:52:31,357 --> 01:52:32,932
"What was he in reality"

1385
01:52:33,012 --> 01:52:37,616
"And what did I take him for"

1386
01:53:01,729 --> 01:53:07,656
"The face was supposed to
reflect a man's heart"

1387
01:53:11,703 --> 01:53:17,588
"The face was supposed to
reflect a man's heart"

1388
01:53:17,843 --> 01:53:24,467
"I mistook every expression
that his face registered"

1389
01:53:24,547 --> 01:53:25,998
"What was he in reality"

1390
01:53:26,078 --> 01:53:30,644
"And what did I take him for"

1391
01:53:51,695 --> 01:53:58,048
"I lost everything and was
still heart-broken"

1392
01:54:01,611 --> 01:54:07,373
"I lost everything and was
still heart-broken"

1393
01:54:07,752 --> 01:54:14,216
"And I took the pain
as a gift of love"

1394
01:54:14,296 --> 01:54:16,520
"What was he in reality"

1395
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:20,465
"And what did I take him for"

1396
01:54:20,931 --> 01:54:27,406
"How could I revere
a stone-hearted man"

1397
01:54:27,486 --> 01:54:29,530
"What was he in reality"

1398
01:54:29,610 --> 01:54:33,750
"And what did I take him for"

1399
01:54:34,005 --> 01:54:36,231
"What was he in reality"

1400
01:54:36,311 --> 01:54:40,814
"And what did I take him for"

1401
01:54:43,163 --> 01:54:44,658
Get up, brother-in-law.

1402
01:54:44,744 --> 01:54:48,467
Let me rest. My son has
laid me out flat!

1403
01:54:48,818 --> 01:54:51,334
Your wife wants to touch your feet,
today being the Karva Chauth day.

1404
01:54:51,414 --> 01:54:52,783
Very well.

1405
01:54:53,247 --> 01:54:55,716
This is the only day I get
her to touch my feet!

1406
01:54:56,235 --> 01:54:57,906
Bless you with
all the happiness!

1407
01:54:59,208 --> 01:55:01,434
My son was the rose who
has now become a thorn.

1408
01:55:02,727 --> 01:55:04,416
Today is the day of the
Karva Chauth fast.

1409
01:55:04,891 --> 01:55:08,736
Had Madhuri been here,
we've have been together...

1410
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,962
Anyway... we're going
to the temple.

1411
01:55:13,042 --> 01:55:17,525
Sure. And pray that
you're together next year.

1412
01:55:19,328 --> 01:55:21,783
You haven't touched my
feet, Saraswati!

1413
01:55:22,003 --> 01:55:24,396
Today's not Holi!
It's Karva Chauth.

1414
01:55:24,476 --> 01:55:26,463
I have my husband's picture
with me, although he's away.

1415
01:55:26,543 --> 01:55:29,406
I'll pay my respects to him.
Let's go.

1416
01:55:30,153 --> 01:55:31,863
Great is Indian culture!

1417
01:55:32,353 --> 01:55:34,148
lf not man, his picture
will do!

1418
01:55:44,361 --> 01:55:47,475
Look at that, sister!
- What is it?

1419
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:49,463
There! Right in the front!

1420
01:55:51,341 --> 01:55:52,683
Why don't you wear
your glasses?

1421
01:55:54,241 --> 01:55:55,552
What is it?

1422
01:55:55,767 --> 01:55:58,244
There's a girl with Amit's
picture in her hand.

1423
01:56:07,140 --> 01:56:12,151
I think it's the same girl
Amit's in love with.

1424
01:56:13,594 --> 01:56:16,955
I suspect Amit has
married her on the sly.

1425
01:56:17,386 --> 01:56:18,538
That's possible!

1426
01:56:18,858 --> 01:56:21,951
Or what would the wretch be
doing here on this day?

1427
01:56:22,761 --> 01:56:25,585
Let's go! I'll teach her
a lesson today!

1428
01:56:36,334 --> 01:56:37,549
Mother!

1429
01:56:38,710 --> 01:56:42,616
Madhuri! It's you?!

1430
01:56:45,239 --> 01:56:48,301
When did you come to Bombay?
You didn't even inform me!

1431
01:56:49,059 --> 01:56:51,086
How have you been?
Where are you staying?

1432
01:56:51,430 --> 01:56:56,003
It's your blessing that has
me happy wherever I am.

1433
01:56:57,199 --> 01:57:00,984
This is my daughter-in-law,
Saraswati.

1434
01:57:01,426 --> 01:57:04,049
Although my son has
not accepted her...

1435
01:57:04,559 --> 01:57:06,837
she still revers her husband
on this day!

1436
01:57:07,387 --> 01:57:10,203
This is my sister, Saraswati.

1437
01:57:10,567 --> 01:57:11,804
Hello, aunty.
- Bless you.

1438
01:57:11,884 --> 01:57:15,639
Am I not unfortunate to
have such a useless son!

1439
01:57:16,219 --> 01:57:17,842
He has forsaken a beautiful
wife like you...

1440
01:57:18,175 --> 01:57:20,259
and is lusting after
the city-bred girls!

1441
01:57:22,741 --> 01:57:28,169
It's true. Although it's shameful,
it's necessary to inform you.

1442
01:57:28,507 --> 01:57:31,476
Amit is caught in the clutches
of a secretary in his office.

1443
01:57:32,013 --> 01:57:34,006
While you are doing your
duty as a wife...

1444
01:57:34,086 --> 01:57:37,276
that man is enticed
by a shameless wretch!

1445
01:57:37,575 --> 01:57:39,418
This is the sign of
impending doom!

1446
01:57:40,129 --> 01:57:41,348
No, Saraswati!

1447
01:57:41,941 --> 01:57:45,192
Now that we've found her,
we will not let that happen!

1448
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:48,587
Come home with me, Madhuri.

1449
01:57:48,950 --> 01:57:52,279
Let's take a decision
on this day!

1450
01:57:52,359 --> 01:57:55,680
I beg of you! Save Amit
from this destruction!

1451
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:59,556
Please don't worry, Mother.

1452
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:01,610
Everything is okay, 
by the grace of God.

1453
01:58:05,437 --> 01:58:08,499
The woman who has enticed
your son in her trap...

1454
01:58:09,229 --> 01:58:12,220
is none other than me.

1455
01:58:14,288 --> 01:58:19,989
You? Are you Amit's private
secretary, Malti Chaudhary?

1456
01:58:20,288 --> 01:58:24,625
Yes. I'm Madhuri...
and also Malti.

1457
01:58:25,004 --> 01:58:26,992
How did you work
this miracle?

1458
01:58:28,259 --> 01:58:31,451
It is the result of a woman's
sincerity and dedication.

1459
01:58:32,498 --> 01:58:35,488
I had made up my mind, that
should I have the strength...

1460
01:58:35,568 --> 01:58:38,146
and should my marriage
be sacred...

1461
01:58:38,226 --> 01:58:40,486
my husband would himself
come back to me.

1462
01:58:41,762 --> 01:58:43,662
And that is what
has happened.

1463
01:58:44,252 --> 01:58:48,043
I always knew that you and
your husband dote on me.

1464
01:58:48,677 --> 01:58:53,868
But I was scared whether
my husband would accept me.

1465
01:58:54,642 --> 01:58:57,263
But I've had enough
of this now.

1466
01:58:57,703 --> 01:59:00,316
Please take me to my house.
- No, my dear.

1467
01:59:00,774 --> 01:59:06,167
The game isn't over as yet.
Our husbands are yet to be punished.

1468
01:59:07,037 --> 01:59:09,501
My husband has played
practical jokes all his life.

1469
01:59:09,950 --> 01:59:13,373
In fact, he reduced our
lives to a cheap joke.

1470
01:59:14,086 --> 01:59:20,403
And my son kept looking for
wisdom, through his glasses.

1471
01:59:20,825 --> 01:59:23,104
Be patient, Madhuri.

1472
01:59:23,438 --> 01:59:28,215
Let us both teach our
husbands a lesson!

1473
01:59:28,919 --> 01:59:31,329
Let's shake hands on that,
daughter-in-law! Go on!

1474
02:00:08,075 --> 02:00:13,098
Is the cold war between
father and son still on?

1475
02:00:13,851 --> 02:00:16,635
Must you show how silly you
are, the moment you arrive?

1476
02:00:16,715 --> 02:00:20,730
Do I? You're the sensible ones!
You will learn a lesson now!

1477
02:00:20,975 --> 02:00:22,463
What kind of a wife are you?

1478
02:00:23,203 --> 02:00:25,179
You're always rubbing salt
in my wounds!

1479
02:00:25,435 --> 02:00:31,061
You deserved to be thrown in a sea
of salt for what you've done!

1480
02:00:39,616 --> 02:00:40,616
Who's that?

1481
02:00:40,847 --> 02:00:45,242
This is his private secretary
Miss Malti Chaudhary.

1482
02:00:45,424 --> 02:00:47,457
Malti Chaudhary?!

1483
02:00:47,694 --> 02:00:52,475
So you are the wretch who's
trying to rape my son!

1484
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:56,677
How's Amit keeping now?

1485
02:00:56,853 --> 02:01:00,672
Don't you know?
He died of a heart-failure!

1486
02:01:00,752 --> 02:01:03,153
God-forbid! What nonsense!

1487
02:01:03,992 --> 02:01:07,419
Let me speak to her...
- No! I won't!

1488
02:01:07,661 --> 02:01:09,056
Go away!

1489
02:01:10,485 --> 02:01:13,234
Haven't you disconnected
as yet, you wretch!

1490
02:01:15,372 --> 02:01:18,369
How can you say that,
father-in-law?

1491
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:21,768
I'm still trying
to connect...

1492
02:01:21,848 --> 02:01:24,460
and you're talking of
disconnecting !

1493
02:01:25,771 --> 02:01:28,159
Don't you dare call me
father-in-law !

1494
02:01:28,797 --> 02:01:31,990
Bloody sinner!
Bloody lady bandit!

1495
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:35,351
Listen carefully to me!

1496
02:01:35,855 --> 02:01:38,341
Should you even dare
to look at my son...

1497
02:01:39,035 --> 02:01:42,672
I'll use hired goons to
hack you to pieces!

1498
02:01:42,894 --> 02:01:46,753
You're a liar,
father-in-law!

1499
02:01:47,685 --> 02:01:49,811
You call me father-in-law
again! What do you mean?

1500
02:01:49,891 --> 02:01:52,990
Didn't you lie that
Amit is dead?

1501
02:01:54,099 --> 02:01:56,399
I'm alive, darling!

1502
02:01:56,479 --> 02:01:59,239
Our love is alive, too!
No one can separate us!

1503
02:01:59,607 --> 02:02:01,451
Who's that speaking
on the line?

1504
02:02:01,531 --> 02:02:03,390
Can't you hear me speaking
to the wretched woman?

1505
02:02:03,856 --> 02:02:08,233
You witch! Sorceress!
Bloody bandit!

1506
02:02:08,730 --> 02:02:12,261
Amit is as good as
dead for you!

1507
02:02:14,758 --> 02:02:17,501
This is a cross-connection!
Just hang up!

1508
02:02:18,424 --> 02:02:21,610
So what were you saying,
you cursed woman?

1509
02:02:22,359 --> 02:02:26,806
All I want to tell you,
father-in-law...

1510
02:02:26,886 --> 02:02:28,828
is the truth that
love is blind!

1511
02:02:28,908 --> 02:02:32,017
You're right!
- Right, my foot!

1512
02:02:32,771 --> 02:02:37,179
Aren't you ashamed
to eavesdrop on us?

1513
02:02:37,527 --> 02:02:41,359
So what did you say?
That love is blind, eh?

1514
02:02:41,788 --> 02:02:44,333
That could be the case.
But I'm not blind!

1515
02:02:44,718 --> 02:02:48,238
If a whore dares
eye my son...

1516
02:02:48,544 --> 02:02:50,647
I'll have her eyes pulled
out of the sockets!

1517
02:02:52,169 --> 02:02:54,861
Why must you take
the trouble?

1518
02:02:55,099 --> 02:02:58,462
If my love is true...

1519
02:02:58,542 --> 02:03:04,283
I will send my eyes to you
on a platter!

1520
02:03:04,363 --> 02:03:05,831
Very well. Have them
sent by this evening.

1521
02:03:05,911 --> 02:03:10,714
Don't do that! It will
plunge my world in darkness!

1522
02:03:12,324 --> 02:03:13,943
Now listen, you cursed woman!

1523
02:03:14,023 --> 02:03:17,317
We will very soon bring our
daughter-in-law home...

1524
02:03:17,620 --> 02:03:19,763
and have her compete with you
in a beauty-contest!

1525
02:03:19,987 --> 02:03:21,561
Just you wait!

1526
02:03:23,699 --> 02:03:27,905
I can't wait.
Bring the village belle here.

1527
02:03:27,985 --> 02:03:33,315
If I don't rob her
of her marital status...

1528
02:03:33,395 --> 02:03:36,789
I will never boast again!

1529
02:03:43,081 --> 02:03:44,814
Either of us lives now!

1530
02:03:54,597 --> 02:03:56,752
Are you asleep or awake?

1531
02:03:57,894 --> 02:04:00,260
I don't know whether
I'm asleep or awake!

1532
02:04:00,340 --> 02:04:02,616
Whether I'm alive or dead!

1533
02:04:05,562 --> 02:04:11,324
I understand it, Amit.
I understand it all.

1534
02:04:13,135 --> 02:04:15,105
Your father will never
accept me.

1535
02:04:16,364 --> 02:04:17,351
Isn't that what you're
trying to say?

1536
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:19,743
Give me one last chance, Malti!

1537
02:04:19,823 --> 02:04:22,752
I'll somehow try and
bring my father around!

1538
02:04:23,121 --> 02:04:25,867
But you love me, don't you?

1539
02:04:27,582 --> 02:04:30,678
Yes, I do. I love you more
than I love my life.

1540
02:04:31,048 --> 02:04:34,752
Will you still love me, even
if I'm not in a position...

1541
02:04:35,174 --> 02:04:36,679
to pay your parents?

1542
02:04:41,279 --> 02:04:45,071
You don't need to ask.
- That's it then!

1543
02:04:45,151 --> 02:04:48,638
Let's have a registered
marriage in court!

1544
02:04:48,718 --> 02:04:50,896
My Mom will stand witness.

1545
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:54,373
I'll give your parents
a written undertaking...

1546
02:04:54,453 --> 02:04:57,014
that they can have half
my salary...

1547
02:04:57,094 --> 02:04:59,412
till such time as their
demand of dowry is met!

1548
02:04:59,791 --> 02:05:02,396
Isn't that okay?
- Okay.

1549
02:05:03,019 --> 02:05:04,842
No power on earth
can stop us now!

1550
02:05:04,922 --> 02:05:07,154
Not your parents...
Not my cruel father!

1551
02:05:07,453 --> 02:05:10,292
Let's meet at the Registrar's office
at 4 p.m. the day after, then. Okay?

1552
02:05:10,735 --> 02:05:12,246
You will come there,
won't you?

1553
02:05:17,636 --> 02:05:18,714
But remember.

1554
02:05:19,193 --> 02:05:22,049
This will be the last
scene of our love-story.

1555
02:05:28,410 --> 02:05:29,721
Listen...

1556
02:05:30,081 --> 02:05:31,379
We are doomed!

1557
02:05:32,625 --> 02:05:34,337
What are you doing here?

1558
02:05:34,525 --> 02:05:37,346
Can't you see me
reading the newspapers?

1559
02:05:37,568 --> 02:05:39,709
You can read the news
tomorrow...

1560
02:05:40,213 --> 02:05:43,109
when our son figures
in the headlines!

1561
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:46,307
Why? Is he being given
a national award?

1562
02:05:46,771 --> 02:05:50,339
He's my son, after all!
- Your son? Big deal!

1563
02:05:50,419 --> 02:05:53,357
Let's hurry up... Amit is
about to play courtesan.

1564
02:05:53,573 --> 02:05:59,925
What?! Courtesan?
Has he had a sex-change?

1565
02:06:00,264 --> 02:06:03,667
He's going to commit suicide
the way the courtesan did!

1566
02:06:03,884 --> 02:06:06,390
He's burying himself alive!

1567
02:06:06,996 --> 02:06:08,378
He dares!

1568
02:06:32,231 --> 02:06:34,786
What are you up to, my son?

1569
02:06:35,154 --> 02:06:38,012
I'm sacrificing myself
in the name of love!

1570
02:06:38,453 --> 02:06:41,989
You are about to undertake
a great deed, my son!

1571
02:06:42,475 --> 02:06:44,189
It will immortalise
our family name!

1572
02:06:44,726 --> 02:06:49,416
But to bury yourself in sand
and cement is a cheap way.

1573
02:06:49,614 --> 02:06:51,158
You should have thought
of a better way.

1574
02:06:51,238 --> 02:06:54,598
No! This is how I will die!

1575
02:06:55,125 --> 02:06:57,310
Those last bricks...

1576
02:06:57,466 --> 02:06:59,399
will cement my death,
the moment I signal it!

1577
02:06:59,673 --> 02:07:02,985
The path of my life
will be shut forever!

1578
02:07:03,959 --> 02:07:07,862
My darling son!
Deign to tell me...

1579
02:07:07,942 --> 02:07:12,328
whom are you dying for?
- For Malti!

1580
02:07:15,431 --> 02:07:18,843
Scoundrel! I must place
the last brick then!

1581
02:07:18,923 --> 02:07:22,238
You will be hanged for that!
- I'll bribe my way out!

1582
02:07:22,527 --> 02:07:25,068
Listen!
Don't kill our son!

1583
02:07:25,148 --> 02:07:29,797
I've had every experience in life
except that of murder.

1584
02:07:30,367 --> 02:07:32,190
Let me satisfy myself today.

1585
02:07:35,196 --> 02:07:37,998
Let's prepare to leave
for the crematorium!

1586
02:07:44,803 --> 02:07:46,288
What a bloody father!

1587
02:07:53,705 --> 02:07:57,907
That's 200 grams of gold, okay?

1588
02:07:57,987 --> 02:08:00,068
Okay, aunty.
I get it!

1589
02:08:00,148 --> 02:08:02,116
Go on! He's coming
this way!

1590
02:08:03,175 --> 02:08:05,803
He'll end his life,
he says! Big deal!

1591
02:08:06,222 --> 02:08:10,208
But I'm no mean father...
I'm a dictator myself!

1592
02:08:11,090 --> 02:08:13,940
What's this?
Gold?

1593
02:08:14,591 --> 02:08:18,973
Come and take a look!
We have stolen gold in our house!

1594
02:08:23,029 --> 02:08:27,041
That's not stolen gold,
Mister!

1595
02:08:27,631 --> 02:08:29,636
It's my hard-earned
savings!

1596
02:08:29,716 --> 02:08:32,284
What nonsense are you talking?

1597
02:08:32,925 --> 02:08:37,483
It's not nonsense...
I'm telling you something!

1598
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:41,413
Okay. Go on. 

1599
02:08:41,493 --> 02:08:45,531
Take a good look, Mr Chaudhary!

1600
02:08:45,701 --> 02:08:50,362
Or show it to a jeweller!
The gold is for real!

1601
02:08:51,234 --> 02:08:53,780
I know that. I'm not blind.
But what is it for?

1602
02:08:58,343 --> 02:09:01,265
You had once asked for
200 grams of gold...

1603
02:09:01,345 --> 02:09:03,911
to accept my sister as
your daughter-in-law.

1604
02:09:04,093 --> 02:09:05,623
There is the 200 grams!

1605
02:09:05,703 --> 02:09:09,029
I've kept my promise.
You must honour your word now.

1606
02:09:09,109 --> 02:09:12,133
Or I'll assume that you are
a two-tongued fraud!

1607
02:09:18,461 --> 02:09:21,641
I wish you had landed
this slap on me...

1608
02:09:22,058 --> 02:09:23,807
when I joked
about the gold.

1609
02:09:25,623 --> 02:09:29,284
You have slapped me repeatedly
by showing me this gold today!

1610
02:09:30,529 --> 02:09:32,317
I had only joked
with you!

1611
02:09:33,581 --> 02:09:37,181
And my son Amit,
who hates village folks...

1612
02:09:37,777 --> 02:09:39,677
cashed in on my jokes.

1613
02:09:40,619 --> 02:09:43,317
I want nothing of this!
I already have it all!

1614
02:09:43,979 --> 02:09:45,048
Come with me...

1615
02:09:52,328 --> 02:09:57,368
Take a look at the
jewellery and money!

1616
02:09:59,850 --> 02:10:02,999
I'm perhaps the only man in
these times of robberies...

1617
02:10:03,079 --> 02:10:05,322
who keeps no less than
half a million in cash!

1618
02:10:06,201 --> 02:10:09,004
Who does it all belong to?
To my son, of course.

1619
02:10:09,404 --> 02:10:11,304
And to my daughter-in-law.

1620
02:10:17,392 --> 02:10:21,490
My real treasure and the
wealth of this family...

1621
02:10:23,066 --> 02:10:29,135
is peace and love and
my daughter-in-law.

1622
02:10:29,968 --> 02:10:31,742
I want nothing but
my daughter-in-law!

1623
02:10:31,822 --> 02:10:34,052
Listen! We are doomed!

1624
02:10:34,285 --> 02:10:37,830
There's terrible news
from Madhuri!

1625
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:42,167
May I read it?
- Why must you ask! Go on!

1626
02:10:42,247 --> 02:10:44,976
My greetings to those who
consider women an object...

1627
02:10:45,056 --> 02:10:47,507
of pleasure and
a mere commodity.

1628
02:10:49,567 --> 02:10:51,524
I'm sending you
200 grams of gold...

1629
02:10:51,604 --> 02:10:54,313
which I want you all to lick
to your heart's satisfaction!

1630
02:10:55,804 --> 02:10:59,379
I'm a modern woman, who is
standing on her own two feet.

1631
02:10:59,657 --> 02:11:01,424
I am taking my
own decisions.

1632
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:05,904
And I have decided
to dispatch to hell...

1633
02:11:06,142 --> 02:11:09,013
my useless husband and
my greedy father-in-law!

1634
02:11:09,264 --> 02:11:11,974
I'm getting married again,
without a divorce.

1635
02:11:12,054 --> 02:11:13,707
The fortunate Madhuri!

1636
02:11:13,909 --> 02:11:18,628
No! This cannot be!
I won't let that happen!

1637
02:11:18,976 --> 02:11:21,501
You mustn't let that
happen, Shreekant!

1638
02:11:21,809 --> 02:11:25,064
It would kill me!
I wouldn't live anymore!

1639
02:11:25,275 --> 02:11:28,618
I beg of you, Shreekant!
I beg at your feet!

1640
02:11:29,348 --> 02:11:33,156
You are making a sinner
out of me, sir!

1641
02:11:33,683 --> 02:11:37,334
It is I who has sinned. To play
such jokes is also a sin.

1642
02:11:38,013 --> 02:11:39,254
I am the sinner.

1643
02:11:39,974 --> 02:11:44,592
But ask your sister not
to punish me like this.

1644
02:11:45,999 --> 02:11:48,972
Only you can help me now.

1645
02:11:50,239 --> 02:11:52,640
I swear by God...

1646
02:11:53,107 --> 02:11:55,413
I'll never play
such a joke again!

1647
02:11:56,363 --> 02:12:00,357
Please forgive me, sir!
I've hurt your feelings!

1648
02:12:00,437 --> 02:12:02,578
I can't bear to see
your plight anymore!

1649
02:12:03,754 --> 02:12:06,623
You will light the
Diwali lamps tomorrow...

1650
02:12:06,703 --> 02:12:09,384
only after my sister
arrives in this house!

1651
02:12:09,842 --> 02:12:12,772
That is a solemn promise
I make to you!

1652
02:12:15,393 --> 02:12:16,774
Let's embrace!

1653
02:13:15,263 --> 02:13:17,727
Malti will surely arrive.
Don't worry.

1654
02:13:18,064 --> 02:13:20,168
She must be getting ready
or even feeling shy.

1655
02:13:20,843 --> 02:13:23,428
Although this is a
registered marriage,...

1656
02:13:23,974 --> 02:13:26,764
she can't forget
our customs.

1657
02:13:26,844 --> 02:13:29,143
I hope we don't miss the
date in the process!

1658
02:13:29,223 --> 02:13:31,036
That's what I'm really
worried about.

1659
02:13:31,939 --> 02:13:33,852
I have a feeling that she
will surely turn up.

1660
02:13:34,566 --> 02:13:36,468
Maybe she's gone to
buy a garland.

1661
02:13:36,548 --> 02:13:39,085
I told her that I hate
this hackneyed customs.

1662
02:13:39,165 --> 02:13:40,635
If I had to adhere to
these customs...

1663
02:13:40,715 --> 02:13:42,732
why'd I get married again
in this manner?

1664
02:13:43,188 --> 02:13:47,157
No one knows that you
are already married!

1665
02:13:47,740 --> 02:13:49,387
Speak softly, Mom! 
What are you doing?!

1666
02:14:04,006 --> 02:14:06,944
My left-eye is
fluttering, Mom!

1667
02:14:07,330 --> 02:14:09,505
I suspect we have a
calamity on hand!

1668
02:14:09,759 --> 02:14:12,740
You shouldn't utter such
inauspicious words, my son.

1669
02:14:13,972 --> 02:14:15,523
There she is!

1670
02:14:43,277 --> 02:14:46,885
What's that, Malti? You have
matrimonial vermillion in your hair?!

1671
02:14:47,149 --> 02:14:48,707
It's I who must apply
the vermillion on you!

1672
02:14:49,261 --> 02:14:52,311
I see! This is Malti then!

1673
02:14:53,402 --> 02:14:57,392
Is it your custom to apply
vermillion before marriage?

1674
02:14:57,864 --> 02:15:00,335
What's all that about?

1675
02:15:00,685 --> 02:15:04,607
It's vermillion. The marital
status of a woman!

1676
02:15:05,474 --> 02:15:09,039
Stop joking, Malti!

1677
02:15:09,535 --> 02:15:11,391
You're going to give me
a heart-attack!

1678
02:15:11,471 --> 02:15:13,319
You should have had
a heart-attack...

1679
02:15:13,844 --> 02:15:16,224
the day you walked out on
an innocent village girl...

1680
02:15:16,596 --> 02:15:19,662
trembling and crying, even
after you had married her!

1681
02:15:20,115 --> 02:15:23,863
Had you a heart, you'd have
suffered an attack the day...

1682
02:15:24,273 --> 02:15:26,372
you feigned love for me,...

1683
02:15:26,743 --> 02:15:28,705
without telling me that
you're a married man!

1684
02:15:28,785 --> 02:15:34,908
She knows everything, Amit!
What happens now?

1685
02:15:35,221 --> 02:15:36,889
Keep quiet, mother.

1686
02:15:39,519 --> 02:15:41,651
How can you do this, Mother?

1687
02:15:42,152 --> 02:15:44,010
Even as your first daughter-
in-law still lives...

1688
02:15:44,090 --> 02:15:46,731
how can you stand witness in
your son's second marriage?

1689
02:15:47,931 --> 02:15:49,242
I couldn't help it!

1690
02:15:49,941 --> 02:15:52,504
My love for my son
has blinded me!

1691
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:59,440
You have put on act with me;
and so did I with you.

1692
02:16:00,172 --> 02:16:03,034
You are a married man;
and I'm a married woman.

1693
02:16:03,616 --> 02:16:05,192
When you had the right
to fall in love,...

1694
02:16:05,272 --> 02:16:08,912
inspite of being married,
I have the same right, too!

1695
02:16:09,729 --> 02:16:12,757
She's right, Amit.
- Quiet!

1696
02:16:14,813 --> 02:16:19,077
Despite all this, I still
have a lot of respect for you.

1697
02:16:19,582 --> 02:16:22,570
Bless me then that my
return to my husband...

1698
02:16:22,828 --> 02:16:24,981
be auspicious and
God-blessed.

1699
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:28,672
May you be happy.

1700
02:16:35,412 --> 02:16:38,192
There's only one
way out now, son.

1701
02:16:38,889 --> 02:16:41,857
Let's bring Madhuri home
on this day of Diwali.

1702
02:16:42,589 --> 02:16:44,915
The second wife has
fled with her husband.

1703
02:16:45,514 --> 02:16:47,678
We only have the first
daughter-in-law now.

1704
02:16:48,049 --> 02:16:50,702
There's a great awakening
among women these days.

1705
02:16:51,155 --> 02:16:53,337
I hope the your
first wife...

1706
02:16:53,724 --> 02:16:55,647
doesn't marry
someone else, too!

1707
02:17:08,643 --> 02:17:11,258
Why are you laughing?
- I was reminded of something!

1708
02:17:12,094 --> 02:17:16,047
Isn't this how you paced up
and down when Amit was born?

1709
02:17:16,663 --> 02:17:20,353
What else could I do?
I was expecting my son then.

1710
02:17:21,229 --> 02:17:24,266
And I'm expecting
my daughter-in-law now.

1711
02:17:24,658 --> 02:17:26,822
Why hasn't she arrived?
- You have changed for good.

1712
02:17:27,133 --> 02:17:29,104
But your son is still as
fickle-minded as ever.

1713
02:17:29,454 --> 02:17:32,567
What if he refuses
to accept Malti...

1714
02:17:32,647 --> 02:17:34,690
I'm not a fool either!

1715
02:17:34,847 --> 02:17:36,873
Look at these documents!

1716
02:17:37,227 --> 02:17:39,771
I have bequeathed all my
property and wealth...

1717
02:17:39,851 --> 02:17:42,075
to the daughter-in-law!

1718
02:17:42,301 --> 02:17:44,765
Let me see how he
refuses to accept her!

1719
02:17:50,957 --> 02:17:52,334
Daughter-in-law!

1720
02:17:53,064 --> 02:17:54,499
Come along...

1721
02:18:13,606 --> 02:18:16,875
We have the Goddess here
in person this auspicious day.

1722
02:18:17,928 --> 02:18:21,080
Do come in, daughter-in-law
and bless this house.

1723
02:18:23,253 --> 02:18:24,801
Come in, dear.

1724
02:18:30,291 --> 02:18:33,720
No! I have already sinned!
Do not commit me to anymore sins!

1725
02:18:35,095 --> 02:18:37,556
We have all made some
mistake or the other.

1726
02:18:38,230 --> 02:18:40,365
But God has forgiven us
and made you return to us.

1727
02:18:40,963 --> 02:18:45,687
Take care of your home now.
- Isn't her husband at home?

1728
02:18:46,093 --> 02:18:47,394
Don't even utter his name!

1729
02:18:49,022 --> 02:18:51,108
I don't want to hide
anything from you, dear.

1730
02:18:51,622 --> 02:18:53,359
Amit has really heaped
humiliation on me.

1731
02:18:53,825 --> 02:18:56,036
He has ruined the
family's reputation.

1732
02:18:57,200 --> 02:18:58,522
But don't you worry!

1733
02:18:59,051 --> 02:19:00,911
If he still does not
come to his senses...

1734
02:19:00,991 --> 02:19:02,337
I will throw him
out of the house.

1735
02:19:02,436 --> 02:19:04,691
Look; I have bequeathed
everything to you.

1736
02:19:04,990 --> 02:19:06,776
All my wealth and estate!

1737
02:19:06,856 --> 02:19:10,875
Please don't say that...
that can never happen!

1738
02:19:11,473 --> 02:19:16,272
Because I'm Madhuri
and Malti, too!

1739
02:19:16,352 --> 02:19:18,389
What?!
- That's right!

1740
02:19:18,794 --> 02:19:20,613
What she says is true.

1741
02:19:21,267 --> 02:19:23,643
When our son rejected her...

1742
02:19:24,021 --> 02:19:27,003
she had to strive and stand
on her own two feet.

1743
02:19:27,733 --> 02:19:29,909
She found a job
in Amit's office...

1744
02:19:30,451 --> 02:19:32,633
and enticed him
as Malti.

1745
02:19:34,911 --> 02:19:39,495
I had to turn Malti in order
to win back my husband.

1746
02:19:39,846 --> 02:19:46,996
Fantastic! You are the
epitome of all virtue!

1747
02:19:48,196 --> 02:19:50,878
Does the ass know
the truth yet?

1748
02:19:50,958 --> 02:19:54,304
Who's that?
- The ass! Amit!

1749
02:19:54,855 --> 02:19:55,929
No. He doesn't.

1750
02:19:56,403 --> 02:19:58,621
Fantastic! This is going to be fun!

1751
02:19:58,981 --> 02:20:01,300
I have now started believing
in your God, too!

1752
02:20:02,087 --> 02:20:05,093
He will come back, all right.
Where would he go anyway?

1753
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:07,719
Take daughter-in-law
upstairs, Saraswati.

1754
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:11,594
I'll deal with the ass!

1755
02:20:18,188 --> 02:20:22,841
All my dreams are
fulfilled today, Shreekant.

1756
02:20:22,921 --> 02:20:24,919
Of course. You had to
realise your dreams.

1757
02:20:25,146 --> 02:20:26,581
As for Amit...

1758
02:20:27,345 --> 02:20:30,946
let him return. And see
how I deal with him!

1759
02:20:56,670 --> 02:20:59,330
When have I turned Pop
from Dad ?

1760
02:21:00,053 --> 02:21:04,289
Since I've turned
what I am.

1761
02:21:04,715 --> 02:21:07,713
Are you drunk?
- What else could I do?

1762
02:21:08,119 --> 02:21:11,184
My father has been drinking
to my grief, all my life.

1763
02:21:11,551 --> 02:21:14,136
To drown my sorrows then,
I had some liquor today.

1764
02:21:14,462 --> 02:21:18,807
I haven't had much...
it's only 10 or 12 drinks.

1765
02:21:19,449 --> 02:21:20,580
Listen, son...

1766
02:21:22,977 --> 02:21:26,720
There's no son and father
anymore. It's all over!

1767
02:21:27,614 --> 02:21:30,821
Throw that cursed bottle away.
And look who's here.

1768
02:21:31,186 --> 02:21:33,500
Your brother-in-law, Shreekant.
- Greetings, brother-in-law!

1769
02:21:33,580 --> 02:21:35,599
Damn the brother-in-law!

1770
02:21:36,245 --> 02:21:41,128
I'll tell you today what you'd
have, if not the Himalayas!

1771
02:21:41,338 --> 02:21:43,846
You'd have a great wall
in my father instead!

1772
02:21:44,066 --> 02:21:47,420
Who'd destroy the world with
his misplaced ideals!

1773
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:50,027
And they'd be forced to
like bitter-gourd!

1774
02:21:50,107 --> 02:21:52,910
What are you saying, Amit?!

1775
02:21:53,672 --> 02:21:55,466
We wanted to give you
a piece of good news.

1776
02:21:55,546 --> 02:21:58,916
What good news?
- You'll get a slap...

1777
02:22:00,677 --> 02:22:03,059
You are our only son.

1778
02:22:03,499 --> 02:22:05,478
In your happiness lies
our own happiness, too.

1779
02:22:05,918 --> 02:22:08,655
We will forget your wife
Madhuri, as you have.

1780
02:22:08,735 --> 02:22:12,226
We will also get you
married to your lover, Malti.

1781
02:22:12,306 --> 02:22:15,104
Yes! Let's forget everything
else, except Malti!

1782
02:22:20,064 --> 02:22:23,255
She feigned love for me!

1783
02:22:24,032 --> 02:22:27,204
She has cheated me!

1784
02:22:27,639 --> 02:22:29,903
I wouldn't want to set my
eyes on her ever again!

1785
02:22:30,357 --> 02:22:33,720
She has betrayed me!

1786
02:22:34,184 --> 02:22:36,907
We want to forget just
what you are trying to.

1787
02:22:37,070 --> 02:22:41,990
We can even bring Madhuri
home, should you be willing.

1788
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:49,860
What joke is this between
Madhuri and Malti?!

1789
02:22:50,937 --> 02:22:52,694
I want neither!

1790
02:22:52,774 --> 02:22:55,317
Neither the village-belle
nor the city-bred!

1791
02:22:55,397 --> 02:22:57,793
I will remain a bachelor
all my life.

1792
02:22:57,873 --> 02:23:02,717
And I will show everyone
how you have ruined my life!

1793
02:23:02,797 --> 02:23:05,829
You have! A wicked
father has!

1794
02:23:05,909 --> 02:23:11,589
Who has killed and mauled
his only son!

1795
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:13,125
Don't worry!

1796
02:23:13,503 --> 02:23:16,180
Everything will be fine,
the moment he goes upstairs.

1797
02:23:28,095 --> 02:23:30,726
You?! What the hell
are you doing here?

1798
02:23:34,356 --> 02:23:39,591
Forgive me.
I had no other choice.

1799
02:23:42,373 --> 02:23:44,958
You scheming bitch!

1800
02:23:45,181 --> 02:23:47,174
You first pretended to
fall in love with me!

1801
02:23:47,254 --> 02:23:49,735
And you've gotten into my house now!
Get the hell out of here!

1802
02:23:49,967 --> 02:23:52,730
Get out, I say!

1803
02:23:52,810 --> 02:23:56,170
I will end the
drama you've begun!

1804
02:23:58,431 --> 02:23:59,933
Get out!

1805
02:24:00,692 --> 02:24:02,847
Not a word from you!

1806
02:24:04,343 --> 02:24:05,741
Listen to me...
- Come on!

1807
02:24:16,713 --> 02:24:17,942
Let's go!

1808
02:24:27,199 --> 02:24:30,218
What's that?
- The marriage altar.

1809
02:24:31,493 --> 02:24:34,293
What do you mean?
- I'll explain.

1810
02:24:35,179 --> 02:24:38,065
Ladies and gentlemen...

1811
02:24:38,420 --> 02:24:39,647
Hold it, you idiot!

1812
02:24:39,851 --> 02:24:43,875
How dare you address them
without our presence?

1813
02:24:45,022 --> 02:24:46,700
Get on with your speech!

1814
02:24:47,751 --> 02:24:49,618
Ladies and gentlemen...

1815
02:24:50,338 --> 02:24:53,587
you mustn't have heard or
seen a marriage of this kind.

1816
02:24:54,368 --> 02:24:58,326
A man is marrying his wife
for the second time today.

1817
02:24:58,792 --> 02:24:59,883
What does that mean?

1818
02:24:59,963 --> 02:25:04,202
Just as I had humiliated
my wife in public...

1819
02:25:04,282 --> 02:25:06,658
at the wedding-altar
one day...

1820
02:25:07,274 --> 02:25:14,335
I now apologise to my wife
in your presence with folded hands.

1821
02:25:14,415 --> 02:25:16,609
What's that you're doing?

1822
02:25:16,827 --> 02:25:18,899
I married Madhuri
during the days...

1823
02:25:20,197 --> 02:25:22,132
when I was blinded by the
glasses of stupidity.

1824
02:25:22,458 --> 02:25:25,827
My father cast a shadow
in one of the lens!

1825
02:25:27,331 --> 02:25:30,000
It did take time.
But I realised the truth.

1826
02:25:31,009 --> 02:25:33,868
I was the only filth
around my rose-like wife.

1827
02:25:34,194 --> 02:25:37,458
And also...
- Your father!

1828
02:25:37,643 --> 02:25:39,408
Before this sacred fire,...

1829
02:25:40,538 --> 02:25:42,486
around which we have
taken the vows...

1830
02:25:43,363 --> 02:25:48,149
I choose Madhuri as my
companion till eternity!

1831
02:25:49,566 --> 02:25:53,418
Please forgive me, Madhuri.

1832
02:25:53,779 --> 02:25:57,500
Don't say that!
But how did you...

1833
02:25:58,212 --> 02:26:01,362
Don't be angry, my dear.

1834
02:26:01,538 --> 02:26:03,685
I couldn't see him upset.

1835
02:26:03,993 --> 02:26:06,809
And so I told him
the whole truth.

1836
02:26:07,346 --> 02:26:08,921
Forgive him, dear.

1837
02:26:09,348 --> 02:26:14,727
I knew the bitter-gourd would
drill some sense into him!

1838
02:26:15,624 --> 02:26:19,206
I'll answer you today, Shreekant.
Had it not been for the Himalayas...

1839
02:26:19,526 --> 02:26:20,508
What would we have then?

1840
02:26:21,078 --> 02:26:23,005
We'd have the daughter-in-law!
