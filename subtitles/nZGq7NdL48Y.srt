1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,182
I wish you all a very happy Diwali in advance.

3
00:00:04,182 --> 00:00:06,559
Last year I made a video on Ramayana,

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:11,789
in which I discussed how some people try to justify Ravana.

5
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:15,199
They try to use illogical arguments to prove that

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,762
Ravana was not that bad.

7
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:20,347
I countered those points in detail in that video.

8
00:00:20,347 --> 00:00:22,811
And in today's Diwali special video,

9
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:24,744
I would like to focus on three things.

10
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:27,629
First, an allegation that many people put on Lord Ram.

11
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:30,094
When Ram returned to Ayodhya,

12
00:00:30,094 --> 00:00:32,904
he left his pregnant wife, Sita.

13
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:35,020
Along with this, some people also say that

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,962
Ram k!lled a Shudra named Shambuk

15
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:40,062
just because he was meditating.

16
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:41,942
In fact, these are two such things that

17
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:47,271
Dr Ambedkar mentioned in his booklet, 
Riddles of Ram and Krishna.

18
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:53,254
The second thing is one of my old clips
on Ramayana which is often shared on social media.

19
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:57,457
Today I would like to clarify my opinion on Ramayana.

20
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,642
And thirdly, we will expose some people

21
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:03,698
who spread filth in society using Ram's name.

22
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:09,052
We will understand why it is important 
to protect Ram from Nathuram.

23
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:10,272
Come, let's get to it.

24
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,521
Friends, you must have seen this in 
some old movies and storybooks.

25
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:24,848
When the story ends, it says,

26
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:27,774
"And they lived happily ever after."

27
00:01:27,774 --> 00:01:30,555
Look at Chapter 128 of Valmiki's Ramayana.

28
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:34,251
This is the last Chapter of the sixth section, 
the Yuddha Kand.

29
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,271
In this, our story ends.

30
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:38,242
Ram was crowned the king.

31
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:40,089
Vibhishan returned to Lanka.

32
00:01:40,089 --> 00:01:42,158
Sugreev returned to Kishkindha.

33
00:01:42,158 --> 00:01:45,367
Ram asked Lakshman to rule as a Prince Regent.

34
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:47,219
But when Lakshman refused

35
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,387
he appointed Bharat.

36
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:52,878
After this, in Shloka 95 to Shloka 106,

37
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:54,809
Ram's kingdom is described.

38
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:57,759
This is the section which you can consider

39
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,562
as the "and they lived happily ever after" section.

40
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:05,274
Ram carried out the Paundarika, 
Ashvamedha, Vajapeya, and other rituals,

41
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:07,149
and pleased the Gods.

42
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:09,061
There was no danger from wild animals.

43
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,651
There were no diseases.

44
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:12,981
There were no thieves or dacoits.

45
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:15,303
People lived for thousands of years,

46
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,070
without any disease or sorrow.

47
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,241
The old people didn't have to 
perform the last rites for young people.

48
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,134
Trees bore fruits and flowers regularly.

49
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:26,480
Clouds would rain at the right time.

50
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,143
The touch of the wind was blissful.

51
00:02:29,143 --> 00:02:31,879
Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra

52
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,019
were doing their own work.

53
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,154
They were satisfied with their work,

54
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:38,626
were happy and without greed.

55
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,345
Shloka 106 says,

56
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:42,050
Sarve Lakshan Sampana,

57
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,498
Sarve Dharm Parayana,

58
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:45,760
Dash Varsh Sahetrasani

59
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,384
Ram Rajyam Karyat.

60
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:50,418
It means that everyone had distinct qualities

61
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:52,864
and everyone behaved as per dharma.

62
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:55,239
That is, they behaved ethically.

63
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:58,731
That is why Ram's reign lasted for 10,000 years.

64
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:01,273
Now, after hearing all this, 
one thing must have become clear to you

65
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:04,740
this is a happily ever after ending of the story.

66
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,197
Think for yourself,

67
00:03:06,197 --> 00:03:09,314
does it make sense for the story to continue after this?

68
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,997
If our story was incomplete in any sense,

69
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:17,159
then there was no need to write this 
'happily ever after' section in such detail.

70
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,449
And the thing is that the 
allegations that are put on Ram here

71
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:22,871
that he left Sita and k!lled a Shudra,

72
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:25,114
all of that is a part of Uttar Kand.

73
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:27,405
And this Uttar Kand is an addition

74
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:29,685
that was added later to the Ramayana.

75
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:35,169
An addition that forcefully 
continues this 'happily ever after' ending.

76
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:39,744
There is a lot of evidence that 
the story actually ended there.

77
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:42,057
After this last 'happily ever after' section,

78
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:44,083
only one section remained in Ramayan,

79
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,961
which is the section of Phalashruti.

80
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:49,717
This tells you about the benefits

81
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:51,529
of listening to this particular scripture.

82
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:54,427
The final Shloka is written in 125.

83
00:03:54,427 --> 00:03:57,402
"This narration is to be listened 
invariably by good people,

84
00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:59,775
seeking for wisdom, longevity, health,

85
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:01,987
fame, fraternity, intelligence,

86
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:03,810
welfare and brilliance."

87
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,432
This is the ending of the original Valmiki's Ramayan.

88
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:08,508
In this same Phalashruti section,

89
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:10,470
there is a verse, Shloka 108,

90
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,922
in which it is mentioned that

91
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:15,755
"This foremost lyric... 
as written at first by Valmiki."

92
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,634
Once again, it is proved that

93
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:20,202
the scripture is complete at this point.

94
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:22,271
Now, it is important to mention here that

95
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:24,619
in Uttar Karna, there are some things

96
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:28,022
that negate the story of Valmiki's Ramayan,

97
00:04:28,022 --> 00:04:29,789
it's in contradiction.

98
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:33,504
For example, we saw how Ram Rajya has been described.

99
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:34,915
Everyone was happy,

100
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:37,109
people from all sections of society were doing their work

101
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:40,034
and lived for thousands of years without any sorrow.

102
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:42,552
But Shambuk's story as written in the Uttar Kand,

103
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:44,481
goes against this description.

104
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:47,125
In this story, a Brahmin's son dies

105
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,525
which causes him immense grief.

106
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:52,593
And after that, Shambuk was k!lled by Ram.

107
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,496
But Valmiki wrote in the end

108
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:58,771
that no old person had to perform 
the last rites for their young son.

109
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:00,030
Listen to another example.

110
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,105
In this story, Ram sits on the Pushpak Viman

111
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:04,671
and looks for Shambuk.

112
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:09,385
But in Valmiki's Ramayan's Chapter 127 
of the Yuddha Kand is was written that

113
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:11,295
When Ram returned to Ayodhya,

114
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,446
he sent Pushpak Viman back to Kuber.

115
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:15,732
And while we're talking about Kuber,

116
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,984
in Chapter 13 of the Uttar Kand it is written that

117
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,159
Ravan and other demons

118
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:23,998
were disrupting the rituals 
performed by many sages and deities.

119
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:26,965
Hearing this, Kuber sent a messenger to Ravan.

120
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:28,890
This messenger met Vibhishan first

121
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,060
and he took the messenger to Ravan.

122
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,035
Ravan then k!lled that messenger with a sword

123
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:36,802
and demons ate his d3ad body.

124
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:39,528
This part of the story is a prequel

125
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:42,051
to the story of Sita's abduction.

126
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:45,263
But in Valmiki Ramayan, when Sita is kidnapped,

127
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:48,746
Ram sent several peace messengers to Ravan.

128
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:50,244
First Angad, then Hanuman.

129
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:52,535
When Hanuman was brought to Ravan,

130
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:55,552
Ravan wondered what to do with Hanuman.

131
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:57,582
He asked Vibhishan for advice.

132
00:05:57,582 --> 00:06:00,289
In Sundarkand, Chapter 52, Shloka 15,

133
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,256
Vibhishan lists the acceptable punishments for messengers.

134
00:06:03,256 --> 00:06:04,492
Cutting off the limbs,

135
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:05,381
hitting them with whips,

136
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:06,929
shaving the head,

137
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:08,245
making a mark on the body.

138
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:11,711
And he goes on to say that they 
hadn't heard about k!lling a messenger.

139
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,045
If you believe the Uttar Kand to be true,

140
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:16,882
had Ravan already k!lled Kuber's messenger,

141
00:06:16,882 --> 00:06:18,903
why would Vibhishan say this?

142
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:22,067
So friends, after seeing all this evidence, 
one thing becomes clear

143
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:25,558
Uttar Kand is not a part of the original Ramayan.

144
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:27,374
It was added later

145
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:31,606
and the way it negates the original story

146
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:35,447
it should never be considered 
as a continuation of Ramayan.

147
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:37,081
Now you may be wondering

148
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:40,127
who wrote this Uttar Kand
and when was it written?

149
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,968
Historically, we don't have any solid evidence

150
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,549
but we can guess that

151
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:46,341
it is a story which

152
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:50,913
was added to promote Brahmanical superiority and casteism.

153
00:06:50,913 --> 00:06:54,085
To prove that Brahmins are superior to Shudras.

154
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:57,526
And Sita's story looks like an obvious attempt

155
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:59,237
to promote patriarchy.

156
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:01,398
That men have power

157
00:07:01,398 --> 00:07:03,476
and men control women.

158
00:07:03,476 --> 00:07:06,878
It seems that some casteist 
and sexist people in the society,

159
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:09,773
added this continuation to Ramayana

160
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:12,412
to use it for their agenda back then.

161
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:14,012
And if we talk about the agenda,

162
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:15,538
there are still some people

163
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:17,544
who use the name of Ram

164
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:20,085
to promote wrong things in society,

165
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:21,783
to promote bad habits.

166
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:26,332
To use the slogans of Jai Shri Ram 
while bullying, and abusing women.

167
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:28,425
And these people are hurt the most 

168
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:30,328
by watching my videos on religion.

169
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:33,245
They are bewildered by my 
audacity to talk about religion.

170
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,095
They do not like that I tell people 
about the good aspects of religion.

171
00:07:35,095 --> 00:07:37,094
If people start learning good things from religion,

172
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:39,974
then the religious polarity 
they are trying to create won't work.

173
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:41,915
Often people like these try to discredit me,

174
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:46,427
by showing my old clips out of context 
and sharing it on social media,

175
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:48,000
about what I said earlier.

176
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,522
This is one of my clips on Ramayan 
that is shared by these people.

177
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:53,307
"So people say because that bridge exists,

178
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,711
it is a part of our history.

179
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:55,795
That this story did actually happen.

180
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:57,899
But people think of it only at one level,

181
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:59,193
they don't go deeper than that.

182
00:07:59,193 --> 00:08:00,000
-Correct, they won't question it.
-they don't go deeper than that.

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,252
-Correct, they won't question it.
-Try applying some deductive reasoning to it.

184
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:03,579
Does the existence of a man-made thing

185
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:05,191
prove that the whole story is real?

186
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:06,284
Isn't it the same logic that

187
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:09,184
since New York City is shown in Spiderman,

188
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:10,840
and since New York City exists in real life.

189
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,737
-So, Spiderman is also real. 
-Spiderman exists too.

190
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:13,739
That not how it works."

191
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:15,118
In this clip, I am talking about

192
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:17,071
how when I was a 7 or 8-year-old kid,

193
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:20,777
I heard the Ramayana and wondered how it could be possible.

194
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:24,193
How could there be flying vessels in those days,

195
00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:27,947
and someone could lift a mountain and cross a sea?

196
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:31,177
When I was a kid, I still didn't believe in these things.

197
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,153
I added that these stories are like

198
00:08:33,153 --> 00:08:35,210
Santa Claus' stories.

199
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,562
I was doing this interview with Karan Singh,

200
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:39,374
a famous magician-mentalist.

201
00:08:39,822 --> 00:08:42,219
In the interview, he talks about how 
he used to go to the Gurudwara,

202
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,462
when his parents insisted,

203
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:46,924
but he too didn't believe in the existence of God.

204
00:08:46,924 --> 00:08:51,076
We were mostly talking about 
deductive reasoning and atheism.

205
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:55,120
To explain critical thinking and logical fallacy, 
I took the example of Spiderman.

206
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,454
How in Spiderman's comics,

207
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,512
New York City is mentioned.

208
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:01,858
New York City does exist in real life,

209
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:04,744
but that doesn't mean that Spiderman is real.

210
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,450
Similarly, I said that if Ram Setu is real,

211
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,318
it doesn't mean that the 
stories told in Ramayana will be real.

212
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:14,011
But I never said that Ramayana never happened.

213
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:18,177
It is clear that Ramayana is a religious 
scripture written at some point in history.

214
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:20,825
Historians estimate that Valmiki's Ramayana

215
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:24,003
was written between the 7th century and the 4th century BC.

216
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,291
But did the stories written in this epic

217
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,341
actually take place or not?

218
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:30,947
Unfortunately, we don't know about this.

219
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:34,597
I personally believe that these 
things may have happened in the past.

220
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:37,759
But not in the way they have been written.

221
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,056
I believe that this is a metaphorical epic.

222
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:44,788
When it is said that Lord Hanuman picked up a mountain

223
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:47,565
and flew across the sea carrying it,

224
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:49,827
this is not physically possible,

225
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:51,489
even a child can understand this.

226
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:54,149
But this may be written like a metaphor.

227
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:56,456
Because often in writing and communication,

228
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:58,782
metaphors are used in this way.

229
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:02,895
If I want to say that Saurabh 
works very hard and does so much,

230
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:06,495
I might say that he is carrying 
a mountain on his shoulders.

231
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:10,349
Or there is the saying,
"I will cross the seven oceans for you."

232
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:12,025
If I say this to someone,

233
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:14,869
it doesn't mean that I will literally 
cross the seven oceans for them.

234
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:17,685
Or that Saurabh is literally 
carrying a mountain on his shoulders.

235
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:20,375
The metaphor means that he is very hardworking.

236
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,523
Crossing the seven oceans means 
that I will put all my heart and soul into it.

237
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,481
Apart from this, it is also possible that

238
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:29,043
while writing Ramayan, the Atishayokti Alankar was used.

239
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:36,274
In literature, writers and poets often 
exaggerate while describing real events.

240
00:10:36,274 --> 00:10:38,902
For example, have you seen the Hollywood film 300?

241
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:40,961
In this film, a historic battle has been shown

242
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:42,655
between the Persians and the Greeks.

243
00:10:43,282 --> 00:10:46,418
Indeed, this battle did actually happen.

244
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,479
And the Greeks fought with great bravery.

245
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:51,565
But many ancient authors and filmmakers

246
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:54,535
have exaggeratedly shown that

247
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:58,177
300 Spartans fought against 1 million Persians.

248
00:10:58,177 --> 00:11:00,243
This number is highly exaggerated.

249
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,176
According to historical evidence,

250
00:11:02,176 --> 00:11:07,762
the Greek army of 7,000-10,000 soldiers 
was there to help these 300 Spartans.

251
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:09,936
And they did not fight 1 million Persians.

252
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:15,199
The number of Persians is estimated to 
have been between 70,000 and 300,000.

253
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:18,887
No doubt, it was a highly 
disproportionate and historical battle.

254
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:23,704
But in films, poets and writers often exaggerate things.

255
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:25,706
To show things as being larger than life,

256
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:27,737
so that they can be more entertaining.

257
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:31,024
By the way, if you like these 
historical and mythological stories,

258
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,463
then I would recommend that you check out KUKU FM.

259
00:11:33,463 --> 00:11:36,749

260
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:39,499

Agni Si Pawan: Siya.

263
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:44,749
Obviously, there is Ramayana too

264
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:48,778
and along with that, there's also 
an audiobook on Veer Hanuman.

265
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:52,223
You should listen to these audiobooks

266
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:55,677

271
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,828
With a thanks to KUKU FM for sponsoring this video,

272
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:15,506
let's get back to the topic.

273
00:12:15,506 --> 00:12:18,844
One more example of this can be 
seen in this India Today article.

274
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:20,655
It is written that Maharana Pratap

275
00:12:20,655 --> 00:12:23,202
used to carry a spear weighing 80 kg.

276
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:26,854
And two swords which weighed 208 kg in total.

277
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:29,373
And his armour weighed 72 kg.

278
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:34,913
So, in total, he used to carry 
360 kg while on the battlefield.

279
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:38,982
Now, no doubt Maharana Pratap was very brave and powerful

280
00:12:38,982 --> 00:12:43,232
but carrying 360 kg on his body 
while fighting on the battlefield

281
00:12:43,232 --> 00:12:44,755
is physically impossible.

282
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:47,358
This is an exaggeration by poets and writers.

283
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:51,024
To find out the truth, visit 
the City Palace Museum in Udaipur,

284
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:54,162
where the armour and weapons of Maharana Pratap are kept.

285
00:12:54,162 --> 00:12:56,558
Their weights are also mentioned there,

286
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:57,464
35 Kg.

287
00:12:57,464 --> 00:12:59,271
So this is my opinion on Ramayana.

288
00:12:59,271 --> 00:13:01,056
But if any of you think that

289
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:05,149
it is possible to lift a mountain and fly over the sea,

290
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:06,798
physically possible,

291
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:08,150
then you are free to believe it.

292
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,683
I don't have any problem if you believe this.

293
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:13,169
Now there will be some people who,

294
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:15,476
try to provoke me into saying something against Muslims.

295
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,515
Accusing me of talking about Hinduism only.

296
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:18,670
To that, I would say

297
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,900
I have made a video on Abrahamic religions,

298
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,158
which you can go and watch.

299
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:23,460
In that, I have clearly said that

300
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,959
there are some stories of Islamic and Christian scriptures,

301
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,416
which are mythologies.

302
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,629
Even though Prophet Muhammad 
and Jesus Christ are historical figures,

303
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:34,341
but the stories of miracles that are attached to them,

304
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:36,294
are not historical.

305
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:39,066
Neither scientists nor historians believe them to be true.

306
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:40,644
So this is not just my personal opinion.

307
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:42,518
Whether it is the story of Jesus Christ,

308
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:44,836
about how he turned water into wine.

309
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:46,723
Or the story of Prophet Muhammad,

310
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:50,000
how he split the moon into two parts with his sword.

311
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:52,228
Or the story of Lord Hanuman,

312
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:54,072
how he swallowed the sun.

313
00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:56,699
All these are mythological stories.

314
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:59,584
They have no place in science and history.

315
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:02,373
I believe that these stories are metaphorical.

316
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:05,504
Like we often say,
"I am in heaven."

317
00:14:05,504 --> 00:14:07,908
I am very happy, I am in a state of bliss.

318
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:09,634
To split the moon,

319
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:13,263
maybe like breaking centuries-old traditions.

320
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:15,240
Or to swallow the sun,

321
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,616
maybe like controlling fire.

322
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:20,365
To establish control over your senses.

323
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:23,042
"From where does all the energy on Earth come from?

324
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:25,161
So what does it mean to swallow the sun?

325
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:27,654
The biggest natural thing that you can see,

326
00:14:27,654 --> 00:14:30,766
Lord Hanuman went and won it.

327
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:32,698
Meaning, he won over nature.

328
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:35,419
It doesn't mean that he ate it as a fruit."

329
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:38,823
There are messages hidden in all religious scriptures.

330
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:40,505
But do you know what the problem is?

331
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,953
People are not concerned about the message.

332
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:44,001
People are just stuck on their egos.

333
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:47,184
They just want to prove that their religion is the best.

334
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:51,335
Some people are even ready 
to k!ll and hurt others to prove it.

335
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:53,554
But they ignore the message.

336
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:56,079
If you put your ego aside,

337
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,548
you will realize that

338
00:14:57,548 --> 00:15:01,196
it doesn't matter if Ram was a divine avatar,

339
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:04,737
a human or just a literary character.

340
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,247
Lord Ram is great because of his qualities.

341
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:09,360
And that's why, whether a person is a Hindu, a Muslim,

342
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,980
a Sikh, a Christian, a Buddhist, 
a Jain, a Parsi, a Jew or even an atheist,

343
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,270
Ram is for everyone.

344
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,854
You must have heard the saying,

345
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:17,581
Ram's name is greater than Ram.

346
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:19,521
While using Ram's name,

347
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:20,829
recall his qualities.

348
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:22,845
What values did he promote?

349
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:27,114
If you apply those values in your life, 
your life will be transformed.

350
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:30,314
Ram is a great model of masculinity.

351
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:32,163
Being fit and strong,

352
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:34,858
but while being humble and compassionate.

353
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:38,250
This is the reason why I call myself a Hindu Atheist.

354
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,123
Because Hinduism has shaped my values.

355
00:15:42,123 --> 00:15:45,703
And culturally too, I follow Hindu rituals.

356
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:47,532
Not to humiliate anyone,

357
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:50,406
like many so-called orthodox Hindus do today.

358
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,075
But because I want to do it from the bottom of my heart.

359
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:54,268
For myself.

360
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:57,253
Ram's name is mentioned so many 
times in Haryanvi culture that

361
00:15:57,253 --> 00:15:59,845
it is easy to remember all these things.

362
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:01,938
Whenever we meet, "Ram Ram, tau!"
[Ram Ram, brother]

363
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:04,592
Whenever we leave, we say, "Jai Ram ji ki!"
[Victory to Lord Ram]

364
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:07,358
The expression for being amazed, "Hey Ram!"
[Oh, Ram!]

365
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,956
The expression for being sad, "Hey mere Ram, ke karu?"
[Oh my Ram, what should I do?]

366
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:13,929
When we sneeze, "Chhatrapati Ram ji."
[Lord Ram]

367
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:16,249
When it rains, "Ram ji baras gaye."
[Lord Ram is raining]

368
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:19,503
When there is confusion, "Ram jane ke hoya ke na."
[Ram knows what will happen]

369
00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:22,504
When we have to swear, "Ram ki soon."
[I swear by Ram]

370
00:16:22,504 --> 00:16:25,236
But today, friends, Ram's name is in danger.

371
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:28,284
Ram's name is being dragged through the mud.

372
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:30,000
You would have heard the saying,

373
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,045
Talking about Ram, following Nathuram.

374
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:40,229
"To live in India, 
You have to say 'Jai Shri Ram'!"

375
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,963
This has become a fact today.

376
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:45,770
Mahatma Gandhi was a great Ram devotee.

377
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,217
But today, the followers of Nathuram Godse

378
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,968
are trying to hijack Ram.

379
00:16:51,968 --> 00:16:54,214
"Nathuram Godse was a patriot.

380
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:55,499
He is and will be."

381
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:57,923
"I consider Godse to be like a God.

382
00:16:57,923 --> 00:16:59,780
Godse is someone we look up to."

383
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,951
"Are you against Godse? 
-Hear me out.

384
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,014
Are you against Godse or not?

385
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:05,180
-Tell the nation.
-No, I am not."

386
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,946
We see reports of how some degenerates of society

387
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:12,377
force others to say "Jai Shri Ram."

388
00:17:12,377 --> 00:17:13,674
News from Madhya Pradesh,

389
00:17:13,674 --> 00:17:15,638
Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr,

390
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:18,116
Kanpur, Unnao, Ghaziabad,

391
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:19,434
Rajasthan's Alwar,

392
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:21,989
Delhi, Assam, Jharkhand,

393
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:23,813
Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal,

394
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:25,796
Bihar, Hyderabad, Telangana,

395
00:17:26,364 --> 00:17:29,814
"Say "Jai Shri Ram!"

396
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:31,435
SAY IT!"

397
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:34,202
This type of news comes in 
from every corner of the country.

398
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:37,953
People are k!lled, burnt alive, l!nched

399
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:39,115
in the name of Ram.

400
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:41,214
If you show such news to these people,

401
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:47,255
they will talk about Muslims who use the slogans of *****.

402
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:50,166
Do you support the slogans of ******?

403
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,834
No, because no normal person supports such slogans.

404
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:55,904
But the mindset of these people is that

405
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:57,483
if a Muslim person does wrong, 
then we will do it too.

406
00:17:57,483 --> 00:18:00,553
If someone else is jumping into a well, 
they would want to jump in too.

407
00:18:00,553 --> 00:18:02,453
If their purpose is to copy Muslims

408
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:04,946
then they can copy great Muslims

409
00:18:04,946 --> 00:18:07,615
like Dr APJ Abdul Kalam,

410
00:18:07,615 --> 00:18:10,361
Dr. Salim Ali, the Birdman of India

411
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:11,607
or Mohammad Rafi.

412
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:13,433
But no, they want to copy

413
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:15,612
Muslim extremists only.

414
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:18,495
Islamic t3rror!st Osama Bin Laden, Hafiz Saeed,

415
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,500
who brought shame to Islam.

416
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,404
Now these degenerates dressed in saffron,

417
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:25,920
are ruining the name of Ram similarly.

418
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,400
Allahu Akbar means God is great.

419
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,129
It's a good reminder.

420
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:36,992
But while attacking, Islamic t3rror!sts have 
used this chant so many times all over the world.

421
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:38,451
Look at the news.

422
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,642
"They have chanted Allahu Akbar."

423
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:42,379
"They have shouted Allahu Akbar."

424
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:45,899
"He pulled out a knife and attacked shouting Allahu Akbar."

425
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:49,296
The call to prayer, Azaan, starts with Allahu Akbar.

426
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:53,430
Which gives you a feeling of peace from the inside.

427
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,011
"I personally love Azaan,

428
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:58,670
when we were shooting for Tanu Manu in Lucknow,

429
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,876
I loved the sound of it."

430
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:05,986
But the extremists use this slogan like a war cry

431
00:19:05,986 --> 00:19:08,003
during t3rror!st attacks.

432
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:09,745
Similarly, Jai Shri Ram,

433
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:13,962
is a slogan that should bring peace to your heart.

434
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:22,331
But now, what do we see?

435
00:19:22,331 --> 00:19:24,822
a violent mob of people,

436
00:19:24,822 --> 00:19:26,799
carrying swords and weapons in their hands,

437
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,401
and chanting Jai Shri Ram.

438
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,486
Look at these news articles.

439
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,087
"We Hindus go to temples to pray,

440
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,237
but these people and their weapons

441
00:19:39,237 --> 00:19:42,003
reach mosques during Hindu festivals.

442
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:45,709
They use the name of Lord Ram 
to raise slogans of g3nocide.

443
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:47,892
They often write on social media,

444
00:19:47,892 --> 00:19:49,617
Dharmo Rakshati Rakshit.

445
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:52,955
They say that they are doing 
this to protect their religion.

446
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:55,057
Dharma Rakshati Rakshit.

447
00:19:55,057 --> 00:19:58,384
Religion protects those who protect it.

448
00:19:58,384 --> 00:20:01,266
They say that they are protecting the religion.

449
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,181
But do you know where this quote has been taken from?

450
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:04,283
From Manusmriti.

451
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:07,153
Do you know what is the definition of Dharma in this?

452
00:20:07,153 --> 00:20:08,273
It is like this.

453
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:10,046
There are 10 characteristics of Dharma.

454
00:20:10,046 --> 00:20:12,097
Patience, forgiveness, restraint,

455
00:20:12,097 --> 00:20:14,496
not stealing, cleanliness,

456
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:16,144
controlling of senses,

457
00:20:16,144 --> 00:20:17,219
increasing intelligence,

458
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:18,474
gaining knowledge,

459
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:21,348
practising truth and remaining calm.

460
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:25,026
But do these people follow any of these characteristics?

461
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:26,103
No one is doing it.

462
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:29,265
They use social media to insult and degrade others.

463
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:31,735
In Mahabharata, it is written again and again,

464
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:34,320
Ahimsa Parmodharam, 
non-violence is the utmost duty.

465
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,587
In Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says,

466
00:20:36,587 --> 00:20:38,461
Parhitsaris Dharm Nahi Bhai,

467
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:40,883
Parh Pida Sam Nahi Adhmai.

468
00:20:40,883 --> 00:20:43,510
There's nothing more important than helping others.

469
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:48,006
There's nothing worse than harming others.

470
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:51,144
Valmiki Ramayana, Ayodhya Kand Chapter 14, Shloka 3,

471
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:53,171
those who have knowledge of Dharma,

472
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:55,895
say that Truth is the ultimate Dharma.

473
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:58,836
Dharma means to do your moral duty,

474
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:00,078
to fulfil your duties.

475
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:02,133
But today, some people use Dharma,

476
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:04,721
to honour r@pists,

477
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,544
get the Mahapanchayat to support the l!nching accused,

478
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:10,469
create apps to auction women.

479
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,579
I want to challenge these degenerates.

480
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:15,320
Show even one Shloka in Valmiki Ramayana

481
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,455
which validates this hatred.

482
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:19,778
But these people will accept the challenge only if

483
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,247
they know how to read and write.

484
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:25,199
That's why I would say, friends, 
that the wise Hindus need to unite

485
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,467
and raise our voices against them

486
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:30,762
so that we can save Ram from Nathuram.

487
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:33,331
So that no one can fool you in the name of religion,

488
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:35,603
read the religious scriptures yourself.

489
00:21:35,603 --> 00:21:39,444
I am putting the link to the entire 
Valmiki's Ramayana in the description below.

490
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:41,269
And when you get time, read it

491
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:43,733
and see what values are taught in it.

492
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:45,747
Jai Jai Ram, Jai Siya Ram!

493
00:21:45,747 --> 00:21:49,841
If you liked the video, click here 
to watch the previous video of Ramayana.

494
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,032
Thank you very much!
