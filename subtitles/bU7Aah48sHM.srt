(Gun Firing)

3
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,917
The convict, despite being a
man of law, has broken the law.

4
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:03,083
He has broken the trust of
the citizens of this country.

5
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:03,875
(Footsteps Receding)

6
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:09,625
He has made many go bankrupt
and driven them to suicide.

7
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,583
(Footsteps Receding)

8
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,208
The convict is accused of
embezzling Rs.2500 crores.

9
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:21,125
I request the court to remand
the accused to police custody...

10
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:26,542
for at least a month
so that this scandal is exposed.

11
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:30,708
And justice given to
the innocent citizens.

12
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:32,458
That's all, My Lord!

13
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:35,208
Considering the case as sensitive...

14
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:38,917
the court accepts the
request of the public prosecutor.

15
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:42,792
And orders the accused to be under
the purview of the chief minister.

00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,208

Sorry sir, you cannot go beyond this.

23
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:14,958
Come, sir.

24
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,042
(Door Opens)

25
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:30,750
Thank you for accepting my
call and coming to meet me.

26
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,833
I had to come,
since you are our special guest.

27
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,208
Why did you call me?
- We need to talk. It's important.

28
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,042
In private.

29
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:43,667
(Door Opens)

30
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:44,792
(Door Closes)

31
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:51,750
You are aware that I am accused
of embezzling Rs.2500 crores.

32
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:59,667
It will be very difficult to prove
whether this charge is true or not.

33
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:04,958
And even if it is true,
where is all that money?

34
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,167
It will take very long to find it.

35
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:08,042
(Chuckling)

36
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:12,458
We have lots of time, Mr. Shah,
don't worry about that.

37
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:18,083
Look Chief Minister, this is an
issue that involves Rs.2500 crores.

38
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,500
HaIf of it is Rs.1250 crores.

39
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:25,500
In India's population
of 80 crores...

40
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,833
there must not be anyone
who has that kind of money.

41
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:36,125
You can have it... if you
get me out of the country.

42
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:39,667
What do you say?

43
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:51,083
Why think so much? Opportunity
knocks on the door only once.

44
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,292
How did you like my reply?

45
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:18,417
Natwar Shah,
you are a very weak person.

46
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,875
When a woman becomes weak,
she begins to sell herseIf.

47
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:27,833
And when a man becomes weak, he
becomes a cheat and criminal like you.

48
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:33,750
You want me to break the trust of
80 crore people for Rs.1250 crores?

49
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:38,083
Make the poor and hungry population of
the country more poor & more hungry?

50
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:42,125
The money you have embezzled
is not your money...

51
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,458
but is the savings
of those millions of people.

52
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,167
I have promised myseIf that until...

53
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,208
I take an account of every
penny of Rs.2500 crore from you...

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,625
I will not let you rest in peace.

(Footsteps Receding)

58
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:25,375
Have you managed to do anything?
- It is very difficult.

59
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:27,500
(Footsteps Receding)

60
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,917
The truth is that it is impossible
to get Natwar out of jail.

61
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,333
Why?

62
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:36,417
The chief minister has made the
security around him so strict...

63
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:39,292
that it is
impossible to reach him.

64
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,417
Are you trying to say
that there is no way out?

65
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,042
There is one way. Only two
people can make this possible.

66
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:54,417
Who?
- One is the chief minister himself.

67
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,542
And the other?
- Tejeshwar.

68
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,708
Move!

69
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:14,708
(Gun Firing)

70
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,167
No one will move.
Get on the floor.

71
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:20,833
Down on the floor!

72
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:25,792
(Gun Firing)

73
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,625

81
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,083
Let's go.

(Glass Shatters)

84
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:17,708
What happened?
This is unbelievable!

85
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:21,000
Did those thieves have
to loot only this shop?

86
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,333
Are you a partner in this shop?
- No...

87
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:30,125
but this shop belongs to my
dear childhood friend, Hasmukh.

88
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,083
He's here, Hasmukh has come.

89
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:35,792
(Footsteps Receding)

90
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:41,417
Here he is.
Have courage, Hasmukh.

91
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:45,458
Who can avert what is destined?
But don't let this loss worry you.

92
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,250
My salary is very small,
but I won't let you go hungry.

93
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,125
I will give you haIf my salary.
A friend promises you.

94
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,208
You will give me haIf your salary?

95
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,750
(Laughing)

96
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,667
He's gone mad.
Oh God! my friend has gone mad.

97
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,500
In fact, God has saved me
from turning mad.

98
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:08,458
How?
- I had sold my shop two days ago.

99
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:12,125
What...? To whom?
- To Sukhiram.

100
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,292
(Sobbing)

101
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,458
I didn't want to, but he
insisted and even paid me for it.

102
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:18,625
(Laughing)

103
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:19,875
Congratulations!

104
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:25,333
Andu Pandu, take Rs.10 and get some
sweets. This calls for a celebration.

105
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,167
Inspector, I'm ruined
and you are calling for sweets?

106
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,667
Respect your uniform.
At least show me false sympathy.

107
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,708
I'm sorry, but I have called for
sweets because my friend was saved.

108
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:44,875
And where your ruin is concerned,
the police will help you.

109
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,750
And the police has inspector
Pyare Mohan in its force...

110
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,250
who will not let
the villain live in peace.

111
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,458
He won't even let him drink in peace.

112
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,417
Cheers!

117
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:10,875

Great! Your aim is very..

121
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:23,750
Who is that?

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,792
It's our man from the police.

123
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:27,542
(Laughing)

124
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:34,750
Tejeshwar, this is Pravinbhai.
- I know, I know everything about him

125
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,250
His job will be done.

126
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,417
How are you?

127
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,042
How much money will you pay us?

128
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:47,375
If you succeed in getting my
brother out of the country...

129
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:52,667
your next 70 generations
will not have to work ever again.

130
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,000
Here's the advance money.

131
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,083
Wow! What sexy money!

132
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:09,917
Can you expect
yourself to do this job?

133
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,833
Hope?

134
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:13,125
(Laughing)

135
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:16,042
Not just expect, we are
confident we can do it.

136
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,958
Maybe you are not aware
of the plan we have made.

137
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:22,000

What do you want?

141
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,292
Have your fun, but remember...

142
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,708
that the crime
you are committing...

143
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:57,000
will one day boomerang on you.

144
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:02,083
You ass, we need
your help for this crime.

145
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:08,000
We've kidnapped you and will commit
this crime in the presence of law.

146
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:12,250
The law cannot harm us.

147
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,875
But that will be possible
only if we help you.

148
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,208
Kill us if you like...

149
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,000
but we will not
betray our country.

151
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,250
Enough of this!

(Laughing)

153
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:55,042
Hey you distinguished doctors!
He is the respected Chief Minister.

154
00:11:55,417 --> 00:12:02,833
He is obsessed about doing good
and we are obsessed about doing bad.

155
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Your life and death
is not in my hands now.

156
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,917
It is in your own hands.

157
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,917
The sooner you do our job, the sooner
you will go back to your family.

158
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,875
So do what we are saying.

159
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,958
This will be fun. We will rule
with the approval of the government.

160
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,375
We will put a stop
to everything else...

161
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,583
and do only one thing now.
- What?

162
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:39,208
We will keep a constant
watch on the chief minister.

163
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:01,125
You stupid ass!
I'll wring your neck and kill you.

164
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,708
You either dip my finger in hot
tea or pour cold water on me.

165
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:07,750
What are you punishing
me for, you dog!

166
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,708
Oh, so you get annoyed
if I call you a dog.

167
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:18,167
That moment was inauspicious when
my sons brought you home...

168
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,958
and seeing your innocent
face, I accepted you in.

169
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:28,833
But I didn't expect you to terrorise
your own master. I'm telling you!

170
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,833
Don't come near me,
I'm not talking to you.

171
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,875
You came and sat in
my lap to appease me.

172
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:42,875
Listen to me.

173
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,500
Reform yourself. As it is, I am
harassed by my good-for-nothing sons.

174
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,458
If you reform yourself,
half my problems will be solved.

175
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,042
You will reform, won't you?

176
00:15:57,917 --> 00:15:59,458
He wet my clothes!

177
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,292
Forget it, mother!

178
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:06,333
It's 10:30 already, but your useless
grandsons must still be in bed.

179
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:11,583
Have a heart!
You are always after them.

180
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,833
They have already left for college.
- They have?!

181
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,083
They will get their results today.

182
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:23,333
Your grandsons are amazing.

183
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:29,167
They are good at being naughty
and good at studies too.

184
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,583
Sir, there is a call for
you from the boys college.

185
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,625
Hello... Yes, speaking.

186
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,792
But... All right.

187
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,625
The principal had come home
for breakfast two days ago.

188
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,583
He has called me to the college,
that too the first time.

189
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:49,792
This time, our grandsons must
have secured even better marks.

190
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,750
More than 95% ...?

191
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,417
(Car Approaching)

192
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:55,750
(Door Opens)

193
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:56,833
(Birds Chirping)

194
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:57,917
(Footsteps Receding)

195
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,708
(Door Closes)

196
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,750
Excuse me. The principal's office...?
- First floor.

197
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,042
But what is the matter?
I'm the principal.

198
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:09,208
You...? How can you be the principal?

199
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:10,333
What do you mean?

200
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:13,958
Some other principal has been coming
to my house for the last few years.

201
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,875
Who are you?
- I'm Hasmukh Rai...

202
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:22,458
father of Bunnu and Munnu.
- You are Bunnu and Munnu's father?

203
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,958
Yes. Any doubts?

204
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:27,458
The man who they have been
bringing to college as their dad...

205
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:29,542
since the last three
years, is someone else.

206
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,042
Fraud...?
- And I have called you here...

207
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:38,042
to inform you that I have
rusticated them from college.

208
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,292
Because they have been failing
their exams since the last 3 years.

209
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:50,292
But they have been getting
90- 95 % marks and you say...

210
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,542
Actually, your sons have never
scored more than 9 % marks.

211
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:54,833
What?!

212
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:57,000
Ashok! Vijay! Come here!

213
00:17:57,542 --> 00:18:00,167
Look at them, they are our
college's best students.

214
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,125
They scored 98 % marks this year.

215
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:06,000
Your sons beat them up and
snatched their marksheets.

216
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,958
They even stole the best
student shield from my office.

217
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,875
Now I know where they get the
marksheets and the shield from.

218
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,333
Bunnu! Munnu!

219
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:23,208
Grandma!
- Son!

220
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:24,417
Both my sons have come.

221
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,417
Look, we have got the
best student shield.

222
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,708
Hip, hip, hurray! Hip, hip, hurray!

223
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,833
We will even get scholarship now.

224
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:39,167
Hug us, daddy! You know what
wonderful marks we've got this time?

225
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:44,125
98 %! And here's the marksheet.
- Bless you, son!

226
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:48,625
Only one answer went wrong,
or if we had scored 100 %...

227
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:53,375
we would've broken the world record.
- A lot is going to break today.

228
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,000
Really?
- Look, the principal is here, too.

229
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:01,292
I think he wants to congratulate us.
- Congratulations, Mr. Rai!

230
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,417
Thank you very much!

231
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,458
What wonderful sons you have!
They are invaluable.

232
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:10,375
They are the honour of your
house and the glory of our college.

233
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,167
You are overdoing it.
- Let him, I'm enjoying it.

234
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:16,042
When I tell people I am the
principal of Xavier's college,...

235
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,042
do you know what they say?
- What?

236
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,958
The same college
in which Bunnu and Munnu are?

237
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:21,917
(Laughing)

238
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,708
Did you see their mark sheet? 98 %!
We must celebrate with sweets.

239
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:32,042
I'm desperate to celebrate since
morning. Come upstairs.

240
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,542
Will you only give him sweets?
- Won't you give us?

241
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:42,667
He is elder to you, let me give him
sweets first, then I'll give you.

242
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,083
Congratulations!
- Come upstairs with me.

243
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:54,750
I know you were a boxer, but why
are you wearing those gloves now?

244
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:58,000
Because I know you were a thief.

245
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:03,000
You've been going to my sons college
as their father since three years.

246
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,042
And you come here
as their principal.

247
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:15,417
After today's beatings
you'll never play a father.

248
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,583
You'll be even ashamed
to have fathered sons!

249
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,125
Help!

250
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:25,833
What is happening, dad?
- Dad!

251
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:27,833
Dad!
- Don't beat him dad.

252
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:30,000
He is our principal, dad!
- Yes dad.

253
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:36,458
You beat the principal?!
- It's now the turn of his students.

254
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:37,583
No!

255
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,583
What are you doing?
- Beating them black and blue!

256
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:44,583
Hasmukh.

257
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:50,042
They snatched my laughter
the day they were born.

258
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:54,417
Do you know that these two have been
failing exams since the last 3 years?

259
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,792
What?!

260
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,000
That shield is not theirs,
they have stolen it.

261
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:04,333
Even the marksheet is not theirs, they
have snatched it from a bright student.

262
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,042
They stole?
- Yes.

263
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,167
Let me show you their real marksheet.

264
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,375
He has scored 9, and he's scored 10.
- I have scored one more than you!

265
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,667
Don't beat him. He is right.

266
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:20,917
(Horn Honking)

267
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,833
Munnu, he's got the gun. Run!

268
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,958
Bye, grandma.

269
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:24,917
(Gun Firing)

270
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,500
Are you hit?

271
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,458
(Car Accelerator Sound)

272
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:36,958
Hey, wait! let us get
in the car at least.

273
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:41,542
Catch! Catch! Catch! Yes, Catch!

274
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:44,667
Stop!

275
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,750
(Car Brakes Squeaking)

276
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:51,375
Are you headed straight?

277
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,542
Since we got into a soup going
wayward, we've decided to go straight

278
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:58,417
Straight!
- Can you give me a lift?

279
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,833
My car broke down.

280
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:01,500
(Car Accelerator Sound)

281
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,917
(Horn Honking)

282
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,167
Does your driver drive well?

283
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,667
He even pilots a plane.
But why are you so afraid?

284
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:16,667
My life is very precious. I have
not done anything in my life yet.

285
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:20,375
I'm going to see a girl for myself.

286
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,792
Which girl are you
going to be cruel to?

287
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,417
What?
- He means...

288
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,042
where are you going to see this girl?
- There is a small hill station...

289
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,708
nearby, Sangampur. I'm going there.
- How does the girl look?

290
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:31,500
(Chuckling)

291
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:36,042
I haven't seen her yet.
- You haven't seen the girl yet?

292
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,708
Even she hasn't seen me.

293
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:42,000
And the girl's family?
- Even they haven't.

294
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:45,542
Our elders had finalised this
proposal. Arranged marriage, you see.

295
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:55,500
What's your name?
- Gullu.

296
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,958
Give your school name, stupid.
- He means, give your full name.

297
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:03,292
Gulshan Kapoor!
- Gulshan Kapoor! Note it.

298
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:07,208
What is your father's name?
- Heerachand Kapoor.

299
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:11,458
Note it.
- He's from Delhi, note that too.

300
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:15,000
Where do you live?
- In Bombay.

301
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:16,917
Note it.

302
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,583
Is this girl from Sangampur?
- No, she is from Bombay...

303
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:25,375
but she has come to her farm
house here. They are very rich people.

304
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:30,458
Noted it down!
- Why are you noting down all this?

305
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,750
(Laughing)

306
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:35,417
(Laughing)

307
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:40,750
Why are you laughing?
- Wonder why when we see you...

308
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,000
we get the feeling that
you are buried neck deep.

309
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,417
You rogues!

310
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:48,708
I've made the biggest mistake of
my life by taking a lift from you.

311
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:50,750
Exactly.
- You dogs!

312
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,125
Right!
- Rogues!

313
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:56,167
Right!
- At least tell me what you want.

314
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,917
Just some rest of 10-15 days.

315
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,333
Father has chucked us out.
- So we will go to see the girl.

316
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:07,792
He will be Gulshan,
and I will be his friend Ranjit.

317
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:11,083
I cannot remove my hands out,
but believe me...

318
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:14,417
I am begging you
to have mercy on me.

319
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,458
I was going to find my
life's first happiness.

320
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,250
That has nothing to do
with our sorrow.

321
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:23,125
Besides, we are not that bad. We
have arranged for your food and drink.

322
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:29,792
Here's your juice and milk.
- Do your other jobs underground only

323
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,250
Bye! See you!
- Bye, Gullu. See you, Gullu!

324
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:35,583
Give me my clothes!
How will I come out in the nude?

325
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,000
(Horn Honking)

326
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:40,333
(Car Approaching)

327
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:43,250
Bajrangi, you drive
very roughly nowadays.

328
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,625
You are scaring us?

329
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:47,833
This house is good.
- I hope the food is good too.

330
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,000
(Door Opens)

331
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:54,667
Hi!

332
00:24:54,958 --> 00:25:00,125
If you think you can
fool me, you are mistaken.

333
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,208
Because I have recognised you.

334
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,917
What?!
- Yes.

335
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:08,583
Now... yes, you are Gulshan!

336
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,292
And he must be your friend.
- You are amazing!

337
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:17,792
I am his friend Ranjit.
And he is our friend Shakti.

338
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:20,792
So cute!

339
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,125
This woman looks elderly.
- Very elderly.

340
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,125
As if you have to marry her.
- Did you say something?

341
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,958
Why haven't you married yet?

342
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,625
(Laughing)

343
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:39,500
Actually, I never met a man
like you until now, son.

344
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:42,583
Son...?
- Laxmi, is baby ready?

345
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,708
She is the relative of the girl,
the girl is getting dressed upstairs.

346
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:58,167
You look so beautiful that the boy
will swoon the moment he sees you...

347
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,167
and immediately
accept your proposal.

348
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:26,500
Who is the girl among them?
- Both are girls, stupid!

349
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:30,625
Which one is mine?
- The girl besides my girl is yours.

350
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:33,000
But who is baby?
- Whoever!

351
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,750
But the one in green is my girl.

352
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,458
Thank God! It is the first time
our tastes haven't matched.

353
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:44,833
I don't know who has come to see
you, but both the guys are good.

354
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,042
They are okay.
- Who is more okay?

355
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:52,000
The one standing besides aunt.

356
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:56,125
Good. I hope he is the one
who has come to see you.

357
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:59,375
Because I find his
friend more than okay.

358
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:03,958
Baby, why are you
standing there, come here.

359
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,875
Hello!

360
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,083
Baby, this is Gulshan.

361
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:14,000
Aunty, he is Gulshan,
I am his friend Ranjit.

362
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:16,667
But you just said outside that he...
- Sorry aunt...

363
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:19,167
but you said with so much confidence
that you recognise us.

364
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,458
Besides, we don't argue with elders.

365
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:22,417
(Laughing)

366
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:25,042
Madam, it is their dad's call.
- Daddy!

367
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:28,042
He must be wanting to know
if I have reached safely.

368
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,833
Excuse me please. I'll talk to him.
- Sure.

369
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:33,125
Thank you! Hello!

370
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:37,667
Gulshan my son, my darling,
did you reach safely?

371
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:41,750
Yes.
- What's wrong with your voice?

372
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:46,958
I had split milk tea on my way here.
I'll gargle with salt water.

373
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,042
All right, come back tomorrow.
- Yes.

374
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,250
Okay! Fine! Bye!

375
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:57,000
What? You are going
to Kanpur tomorrow?

376
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,708
Then I'll stay back
here for 2-3 days.

377
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:06,833
Aunty is very nice,
even the girl is very nice.

378
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,042
Priya!
- Yes!

379
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:12,708
I find these guys to be over smart.
- Even I think so.

380
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,625
Let's begin with sitting up tall
and your legs opened up to the side.

381
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,667
As wide as you can
without straining.

382
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,042
Your back is straight and go up
on your hips, flex your knees..

383
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:24,583
..on the floor, point your toes
and spread your hands..

384
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:26,042
..on the floor in front of you.

385
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,208
And then rock your hips forward.

386
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,667
Feel your pelvis push forward.

387
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,167
Even we'll get up early from
tomorrow. Exercise is a good thing.

388
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:39,833
Our exercise will be
watching them exercising.

389
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,167
What are you'll doing here?

390
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:45,500
We're watching
how well you exercise.

391
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,042
We know what you are watching.

392
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:52,542
Ritu, these guys
are cunning and over smart.

393
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:55,833
Don't say that sister-in-law,
I'm her to-be husband.

394
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:59,625
You are nobody,
I don't want to marry you.

395
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:05,208
Neither me.
- Hey, listen!

396
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:06,458
Munnu!
- Yes!

397
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,417
What is my girl's name?
- I don't even know my girl's name.

398
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,125
How stupid we are!

399
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,708
We are here since yesterday and we
haven't yet asked them their name.

400
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:16,583
Let's go and ask them.

401
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:19,833
(Music Playing)

402
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:34,958
(Singing) "Oh the one with
the red veil, tell me your name!"

403
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:42,125
"Oh the one with the black dress,
tell me your name!"

404
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:52,667
"Tell us your name! Tell us your
name! Tell us your name!"

405
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:05,500
"Oh you crazy for name
tell me what work do you have?"

406
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:12,792
"Oh you crazy for name
tell me what work do you have?"

407
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,583
"Tell what work do you have?
What work do you have?"

408
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:35,625
"Oh the one with the red veil,
tell me your name!"

409
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:39,625
"Oh the one with the black dress,
tell me your name!"

410
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:18,917
"The moment I cast my eyes on you,
I fell in love with you."

411
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:23,083
"You started residing in
my heart and in my eyes."

412
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:29,917
"The moment I cast my eyes on you,
I fell in love with you."

413
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,583
"You started residing in
my heart and in my eyes."

414
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:36,917
"A girl never speaks her mind
in the first meeting."

415
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,542
"A girl will never entertain
any stranger."

416
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:44,000
"Never entertains any stranger!

417
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:48,083
"Never entertains any stranger!

418
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:54,292
"Tell your heart to send some
message to my heart."

419
00:31:56,875 --> 00:32:01,042
"Tell me what will be the
fate of your beloved?"

420
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:07,625
"Oh the one with the red veil,
tell me your name!"

421
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:11,292
"Oh the one with the black dress,
tell me your name!"

422
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:14,875
"Oh you crazy for name tell
me what work do you have?"

423
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:18,417
"Oh you crazy for name tell
me what work do you have?"

424
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:31,292
Where to...? Stand in queue.
- I'm not here to buy cinema tickets.

425
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,042
I have come to collect
money I gave Bunnu and Munnu.

426
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:40,458
Sonofagun! You ruin my sons' lives
by giving them loans...

427
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,667
and then dare to
talk loudly with me?

428
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:46,417
And what are you all standing
in queue for like beggars?

429
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,250
I won't give any of you
a single penny. Get out!

430
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:53,042
This man is worst than his sons.
- Want a kick?

431
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:55,708
Bloody beggar! You call us beggars?
- Your father's a beggar, too!

432
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:59,125
This man is shameless.

433
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,750
We'll recover our money from
Bunnu and Munnu. Let's go.

434
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:07,583
Hasmukhlal be damned!

435
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:11,417
Did you hear that? My sons
disgrace me like this everyday.

436
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:15,583
These petty people come to
my house, curse me and leave.

437
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:18,417
There is not a single shop left from
where they haven't taken credit.

438
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:24,500
They blow Rs.800 on cigarettes alone.
- Pity you, but have courage.

439
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:29,000
You reap as you sow.
- What have I sowed to reap this?

440
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:32,917
You have only one daughter. You are
lucky. Even if I had two daughters...

441
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,958
I would've been a happier man.
- Sure you would have.

442
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:39,625
You should have had daughters
just like your sons are.

443
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:44,167
They would disgrace you and
you'd have to commit suicide.

444
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:47,792
They would paint the town red...
- Do you have any shame?

445
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,083
You just talk anything! Sonofagun!
- Sorry.

446
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,125
Tell me, what brought you here?
- I had come for some work.

447
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:59,042
I forgot. Why am I here?
- Get yourself treated.

448
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:01,167
Why are you giving
the police a bad name?

449
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:05,000
How is your daughter?
- Oh yes! I had come for her only.

450
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:05,958
(Laughing)

451
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,208
He's laughing!

452
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:10,042
Priya has gone to Sangampur
with her friend.

453
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:13,458
She had said she will return in two
days, but hasn't, so I'm going there.

454
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:16,458
I want your big car.

455
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:20,000
One minute! The big car?
- Yes.

456
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:23,875
Are you going to bring back
your daughter or meet your lover?

457
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:27,250
Don't you feel ashamed to
keep a lover at your age?

458
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,833
You haven't seen her.
- I'm don't even want to.

459
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:33,792
When you see her, you'll know
what a simmering beauty she is.

460
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:36,583
Like a ruined star?
- She's devastating!

461
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:41,792
Shall I tell you something? Even
you will go wild when you see her.

462
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,542
Me? I am not like you,
I'm a principled man.

463
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,333
I have never looked at a woman.
- How can you?

464
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:54,000
You will look at women
only if your sons let you.

465
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,958
(Laughing)

466
00:34:57,042 --> 00:35:03,083
Shall I tell you something?
However naughty my sons may be...

467
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:09,708
but without them,
this house seems lonely.

468
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:14,833
It is seven days since they
have gone. I feel depressed.

469
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,083
Wonder where they will be.
- Come on!

470
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:38,458
You horrible monkey! Did you have
to put out your cigarette on my butt?

471
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:43,417
It is said that dogs are most loyal,
but you are more loyal than anybody.

472
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:48,208
You're standing guard since six
days and won't let me enter.

473
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:52,875
I'm going to marry that girl.

474
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:56,625
I wonder what your master
must be doing with her.

475
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,167
Priya, you haven't
slept in your room today?

476
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:05,250
Anyway, it's good,
we can have a chat.

477
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,625
Say something, Ritu. Why are
you turned the other way?

478
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,458
Turn on my side.

479
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:15,125
I'm thinking of telling aunt that...

480
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:19,292
I am ready to marry Gulshan.
What d'you say?

481
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:24,542
They are nice men. And I think
they even love us. What say you?

482
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,500
That is why, though they're here since
a week, they don't want to leave.

483
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,333
I think, until we stay annoyed
with them, they will not leave.

484
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,667
No way.

485
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:40,125
Priya, shall I tell you the truth?
- Yes.

486
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:44,000
For the first time I've felt something
stir in my heart on seeing someone.

487
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,417
Same here.

488
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:52,125
I don't know why I feel that
he should always be around me and...

489
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:56,167
What happened to your hands?

490
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,042
(Woman Screams)

491
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:01,833
What happened?

492
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,208
Nothing, aunt. A fat rat had sneaked
into my room. I drove it out.

493
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:11,500
Okay. It's very late. Switch off
the lights and go to sleep.

494
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,208
What are you doing here?
- I've come to find out how you feel.

495
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:22,250
Go from here, please!

496
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,583
I'll go, but at least give me a kiss.

497
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:31,208
All right... only one.

498
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,542
(Car Approaching)

499
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,042
(Door Opens)

500
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:41,750
(Door Closes)

501
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:46,417
Priya, where are you?

502
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:56,292
"I wanna date you"

503
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:59,583
"I wanna date you"

504
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:01,458
What are you staring at?

505
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,833
What makes you stare at me?

506
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:09,042
I have come to take Priya.
- The kids have gone out.

507
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:11,958
They'll be back soon.
- You mean there is no one home?

508
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,500
Why...? Well, I'm home.

509
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:20,917
This is your chance. Miss it,
and you'll miss it forever.

510
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:22,167
(Chuckling)

511
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:27,875
Anu, did Ritu like the boy
who had come to see her?

512
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:31,625
Yes. I think we'll
have the marriage soon.

513
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:36,375
That's nice, but you will become
very lonely after she gets married.

514
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:37,958
It can't be helped.

515
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:44,583
Even I will become lonely after
my daughter Priya gets married.

516
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:47,000
A desolate house will depress me.

517
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:52,000
That is why...
- You are planning to marry again?

518
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:58,542
I'm busy all day. I must have
a reason to return home at nights.

519
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,958
Shall I tell you something?
"No life without wife."

520
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:03,542
(Laughing)

521
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:07,042
Have you seen a girl for yourself?
- Yes, since two years.

522
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:10,583
50% of the relationship is finalised.
- 50 % ...?

523
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:14,750
Yes, from my side. The other
50 % approval has to come from her.

524
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:21,208
Then why don't you ask her?
- I'm afraid she may get angry.

525
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:26,583
That is the drawback men have.
They unnecessarily get worried.

526
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,833
That is what I was going to...

527
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:30,708
(Horn Honking)

528
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:32,833
The kids.

529
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,625
Bad timing!

530
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,125
You're back!
Priya, your daddy is here.

531
00:39:39,208 --> 00:39:40,500
What?
- Yes.

532
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,750
Daddy!

533
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:42,500
(Laughing)

534
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:44,042
When did you come?
- Just now.

535
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,875
Greetings, uncle!
- Greetings, my dear! Greetings!

536
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:47,000
How are you?

537
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:53,708
Wastrels! What are you
two doing here?

538
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:58,792
Do you know them?
- Only too well. The scoundrels!

539
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:00,500
They were missing since a week.

540
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:03,667
Do you know how worried
your father is about you?

541
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:06,083
Why is he worried?
We had informed him.

542
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:10,167
The world is so small.
Take them for example.

543
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:16,917
You know Gulshan and Ranjit
and their father Heerachand too.

544
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:23,125
Heerachand? Who is Heerachand?
- How forgetful you are!

545
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:25,375
You met daddy yesterday?
- Yes.

546
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,083
And you still ask who Heerachand is?

547
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,458
But how is Heerachand
connected with your daddy, Bunnu?

548
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:35,958
Bunnu...? Who is Bunnu?
- He.

549
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,250
What's all this about, Munnu?
- Munnu?

550
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:41,917
Look aunty, he is calling
me too by a wrong name.

551
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,292
My name is not Munnu, I'm Ranjit.
- Ranjit!

552
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:47,375
(Horn Honking)

553
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:49,583
Is that Bajrangi or someone else?

554
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:54,292
He is Bajrangi and he has
kept the ignition on.

555
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,875
Why?
- Because it's now time to escape.

556
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:59,875
Okay bye, Priya.
- Where are you'll going?

557
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:04,000
Anu, you have been cheated.
- Cheated?

558
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:09,083
Yes. They are the sons
of my old friend Hasmukh.

559
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:12,583
Gulshan and...
I mean, Bunnu and Munnu.

560
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:15,042
Daddy!
- You're back again?

561
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:20,125
Beat me if you like, but save Bunnu
first. He has met with an accident.

562
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:22,667
What?!
- And he has lost his memory.

563
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:24,417
Look.

564
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:29,917
"A pair of beautiful eyes!"

565
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:33,458
"The beautiful damsels
of the village."

566
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:37,000
"She knows the feelings
of my heart."

567
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,583
Bunnu!

568
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:40,250
(Laughing)

569
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:43,583
Bunnu, what happened to you?

570
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,792
Wait a minute, mother. What kind
of an accident was that?

571
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:49,458
I don't see any injury.
- This is an internal injury.

572
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:53,000
The car ran over his brain.
And he went mad.

573
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:54,917
I'm not mad.
- See!

574
00:41:55,417 --> 00:42:00,125
The world goes on the moon,
I will go on the sun.

575
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:04,375
But the sun is very hot,
there is only fire there.

576
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:11,792
That's exactly why I have preferred
to enter it in the night.

577
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,833
(Laughing)

578
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,958
Happy now?
Beat him more!

579
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,250
I'm not their enemy, I beat them
so that they don't go wayward.

580
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:26,042
Now go and call the doctor.
- I'll call him right away.

581
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:30,958
Bunnu, what happened to you?
- Sun..

582
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:35,000
(Car Approaching)

583
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:40,333
Where's your master?

584
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:45,417
Are you Mr. Hasmukh?

585
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:52,042
"For the first time I see love
in the eyes of my beloved"

586
00:42:56,417 --> 00:42:57,917
Are you Mr. Hasmukh?

587
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,042
Yes... tell... me.

588
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:05,625
I've come to you with a complaint.
- But I don't even know you.

589
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,625
Have I done something wrong?
- It is your sons who have wronged.

590
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,042
Do you know what they have done?

591
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:14,958
They had been fooling me
and my nieces since a week.

592
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,208
(Laughing)

593
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:25,750
All that's fine, but what if
acting mad, I actually go mad?

594
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:28,750
Whether you go mad or not,
dad will surely go mad.

595
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:33,792
Do you remember anything?
This is daddy.

596
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:38,625
Daddy? What is daddy?
- He is like me.

597
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:42,250
He is one foolish fellow who
takes the burden of his kids.

598
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:46,000
That reminds him of something?
- No, daddy. I'm trying since long...

599
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:48,250
but he cannot remember anything.
- You must be tired.

600
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:50,458
Come downstairs son,
you'll remember everything.

601
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,000
Son brings me up. Father takes
me down. All right let's go.

602
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:55,708
I'm not afraid of anybody.
- Come.

603
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,250
Do you see them?

604
00:44:02,917 --> 00:44:04,458
Easy, easy.

605
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:08,833
Remember anything?
- No.

606
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:13,625
Then why the shocked expression?
- Just like that, daddy.

607
00:44:13,792 --> 00:44:15,167
Daddy?

608
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:19,667
You have regained half your memory.
I'll help you regain the other half.

609
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,875
Don't! Don't beat a patient.
- Patient?

610
00:44:23,042 --> 00:44:24,875
I'll make you both patients.

611
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,250
Aunty, please forgive
us for our mistake.

612
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:34,792
Daddy is very hot,
please cool him.

613
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:37,042
What?!
- It was tough getting into the house

614
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:39,375
Please do something or he'll
throw us out of the house again.

615
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:42,250
That is your punishment, that you
are thrown out of your house forever.

616
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:44,542
You deserve to go
hungry on the streets.

617
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:48,958
We are not so useless.
We can work hard and earn a living.

618
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,708
Henceforth, you will have
to work and earn a living.

619
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:55,583
You are saying that?
- Just earn two bucks and show me.

620
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:59,500
You are challenging us?
- Yes! I know how useless you are.

621
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:04,667
Didn't you feel ashamed to do such
a lowly act with this decent family?

622
00:45:05,042 --> 00:45:08,833
Ashamed? What for? We love them.
What's your problem, dad?

623
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,500
If you cannot find
the words, forget it.

624
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:19,000
What did you say?
Get out!

625
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:23,000
We are not garbage that you throw
us out of the house again and again.

626
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:27,083
Those who don't follow my orders
are thrown out. This is my house.

627
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,500
Your house?
- Yes!

628
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:32,708
We assumed this to be
our house until now.

629
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:36,667
But you have opened our eyes today.

630
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,833
We will become
something and show you.

631
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:43,250
Then even if you beg us,
we will not come back.

632
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:46,250
Stick to your words!
- I was only joking.

633
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:48,500
Get out!
- Okay!

634
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:54,125
Aunty, thanks for creating a rift
between a father and his sons.

635
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,583
Let's go, Bajrangi.

636
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:59,667
See, even a monkey understands,
but you don't.

637
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:11,333
Friends, well wishers...

638
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:16,292
those who cheat and loot...

639
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:18,458
and those who kill for money...

640
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:23,750
better than those is my monkey
who earns money for his masters...

641
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:30,208
and leads a quiet life.
So please applaud my monkey!

642
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:32,125
(Crowd Applauding)

643
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:35,000
(Music Playing)

644
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,375
(Singing)
"The monkey is very useful!"

645
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:49,375
"The monkey is very useful!"

646
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:51,458
"He beats like Dharmender!"

647
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,958
"He dances like Jeetender!"

648
00:46:54,042 --> 00:46:56,125
"He cries like Rajender!"

649
00:46:56,208 --> 00:47:01,625
"Observe carefully he has the
talents of all the heroes in him."

650
00:47:02,292 --> 00:47:06,625
"May God bless the ones who give
and also the ones who don't give."

651
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:11,042
"May God bless the ones who give
and also the ones who don't give."

652
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:15,500
"May God bless the ones who give
and also the ones who don't give."

653
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:19,917
"May God bless the ones who give
and also the ones who don't give."

654
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,125
"The monkey is very useful!"

655
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:24,042
"The monkey is very useful!"

656
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:26,250
"He beats like Dharmender!"

657
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:28,667
"He dances like Jeetender!"

658
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,792
"He cries like Rajender!"

659
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:36,667
"Observe carefully he has the talents
of all the heroes in him."

660
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:11,708
"Talisam! The talism made out
of the monkey's seven hair."

661
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,583
"One hair from the head,
one from the eyebrow..

662
00:48:13,667 --> 00:48:15,208
..one from the moustache, one
from the beard, one from the chest..

663
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,208
..one from the stomach, one from the tail
and the rest from here and there."

664
00:48:17,292 --> 00:48:18,875
"But Bunnu!
- Munnu!"

665
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:21,000
"The public has a question
in their mind."

666
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:21,833
"Hey! What is that?"

667
00:48:21,917 --> 00:48:25,167
"What is the use of this Talisam?"
- I will tell you right now."

668
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:30,042
"The one who is shy of a girl,
and fears marriage."

669
00:48:30,125 --> 00:48:32,250
"The one who bows his
head the moment..

670
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:34,542
..his wife is in front of him."

671
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:40,333
"After wearing my Talisam
he becomes a brave man."

672
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:43,042
"This increases you hunger
and your sleep."

673
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:45,208
"This stops your pain and gives
you success in your work."

674
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:47,625
"Gives you a job and wins
a lottery for you."

675
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:50,042
"A child passes with good marks."

676
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:52,667
"It has so many benefits and
costs only one rupee."

677
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,292
"That too because of the inflation..

678
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:55,875
..otherwise it was for fifty
paise, isn't it Munnu?"

679
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:57,292
"Yes, Bunnu."

680
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:02,750
"May God bless the ones who give
and also the ones who don't give."

681
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:06,917
"May God bless the ones who give
and also the ones who don't give."

682
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:11,417
"May God bless the ones who give
and also the ones who don't give."

683
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,833
"May God bless the ones who give
and also the ones who don't give."

684
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:18,000
"The monkey is very useful!"

685
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,917
"The monkey is very useful!"

686
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,958
"He beats like Dharmender!"

687
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,208
"He dances like Jeetender!"

688
00:49:24,292 --> 00:49:26,375
"He cries like Rajender!"

689
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:33,333
"Observe carefully he has the talents
of all the heroes in him."

690
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:56,042
"Bunnu!
- Munnu!"

691
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:59,167
"We gave the Talisam to the world.
- Yes, we gave!"

692
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:02,292
"But what has the monkey
done for us?"

693
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,667
"What has he done?"

694
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,292
"Our father threw us out of the house.
- Threw us out!

695
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:08,750
"Has locked our fate?
- Locked!"

696
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:11,333
"Snatched our morsel away?
- Snatched the morsel."

697
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:13,625
"Like a father, the monkey
looked after us."

698
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:14,458
"Looked after us!"

699
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:17,375
"Tell me dear child who is better,
father or the monkey?

700
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,042
"Monkey!"

701
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:23,542
"My dear, please come back home!"

702
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:27,750
"My dear, please come back home!"

703
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:32,208
"Please accept my request."

704
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:36,458
"You are the light of my eyes."

705
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:40,750
"You are the support of my life."

706
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:44,792
"Please try and understand
my feelings, my dear."

707
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:49,083
"My dear, please come back home!"

708
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:53,750
"My dear, please come back home!"

709
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,375
"The windows of the house
are calling out to you."

710
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:10,625
"The walls of the house
are searching for you."

711
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:14,958
"Where has the happiness
gone from the house?"

712
00:51:15,042 --> 00:51:19,125
"Do not dishonor me."

713
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:23,250
"My dear, please come back home!"

714
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:27,292
"My dear, please come back home!"

715
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,458
"We have not broken any locks,
we have not looted anyone."

716
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:31,625
"We have not done any theft,
but we have earned it with hard work."

717
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:33,583
"We have just started this business and
with difficulty we have earned a little."

718
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:35,708
"We have just learnt to live."

719
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:38,750
"We have learnt!"

720
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:45,417
"Munnu, just find out which
was the musical note?"

721
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:52,833
"Yes!"

722
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:56,958
"God bless the one who takes
and also the ones who do not take."

723
00:51:57,292 --> 00:52:01,625
"God bless the one who takes
and also the ones who do not take."

724
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:05,958
"Father we are overwhelmed
at your love."

725
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:10,208
"God bless the one who takes
and also the ones who do not take."

726
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:12,083
"Good that you listened
to me otherwise..

727
00:52:12,167 --> 00:52:14,292
..I would have slashed your throat."

728
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:16,417
"Good that you listened
to me otherwise..

729
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,125
..I would have slashed your throat."

730
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:40,500
"I wanna date you"

731
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:43,875
(Laughing)

732
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,750
What is he doing here?

733
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,167
It is not their fault.

734
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,458
Kids tend to go wayward if they lose
their mother so early in life.

735
00:52:57,542 --> 00:53:01,000
I tried my best to give them
both, a father and mother's love.

736
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:06,750
But today I realise that no
one can take a mother's place.

737
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:11,625
You realise that now? Were your
senses asleep since so many years?

738
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:15,083
Pardon me, but you should
have got married long ago...

739
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:18,667
if not for yourself,
then at least for your sons.

740
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:23,042
Why didn't you?
- I used to love my wife very much.

741
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:28,750
I haven't found anyone
like her until today.

742
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:32,542
Until today?
- No, until a few days back.

743
00:53:32,917 --> 00:53:37,333
But now I think my sons
will very soon get a mother.

744
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:38,958
Indeed!

745
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:42,042
By the way, what is
your programme for today?

746
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:45,500
Nothing important.
- Then shall we go out for a coffee?

747
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:49,250
It will be an outing and...
- Not a bad idea. Let's go.

748
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:51,542
Great!
Just a minute.

749
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:56,208
This flower was waiting to
adorn your hair. If...

750
00:53:56,292 --> 00:53:58,458
Please.
- My pleasure.

751
00:54:02,217 --> 00:54:05,758
Come off it. You are my
childhood friend, aren't you?

752
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:09,800
Childhood friend? If you knew
the real meaning of friendship...

753
00:54:10,092 --> 00:54:12,842
you wouldn't
back stab your friend.

754
00:54:12,925 --> 00:54:15,550
When did I back stab you?
What nonsense are you talking?

755
00:54:15,842 --> 00:54:19,175
Am I? Hadn't you gone to
Anuradha's house yesterday?

756
00:54:19,883 --> 00:54:23,467
Anuradha...? Yes, but what has that
got to do with back stabbing?

757
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,425
The way you talk like
as if you know nothing.

758
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,383
She is the lover of
your childhood friend.

759
00:54:31,675 --> 00:54:36,258
Who?... Anu...
What are you saying!

760
00:54:37,217 --> 00:54:41,300
Honestly, I didn't know you love her.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

761
00:54:41,342 --> 00:54:45,508
You liar, you know
that woman is my life.

762
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,550
I used to take your car and
go to Sangampur. For what?

763
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:53,717
You had told me but
I didn't remember. I forgot.

764
00:54:53,883 --> 00:54:59,467
It is I who tends to forget,
how did you forget?

765
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:04,050
Shall I tell you the truth? You
didn't forget, your intention was bad.

766
00:55:04,383 --> 00:55:08,008
Before looking at her, you
should have given a thought...

767
00:55:08,175 --> 00:55:10,675
to the fact that you are
eying your sister-in-law.

768
00:55:10,842 --> 00:55:15,217
It was she who looked at me first.
- Really?

769
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,633
And she fell in love
with me at first sight.

770
00:55:17,717 --> 00:55:23,050
She loves me. We are having an
affair since the last two years.

771
00:55:23,133 --> 00:55:25,925
You are mistaken, she loves me.

772
00:55:26,258 --> 00:55:29,175
We'll confirm that in the evening.
- On her birthday party?

773
00:55:29,258 --> 00:55:32,633
You know even that?
Doesn't matter.

774
00:55:32,717 --> 00:55:37,717
You can check in the evening who
she is paying more attention to.

775
00:55:38,008 --> 00:55:40,550
Whether you or me.
- Fine.

776
00:55:40,633 --> 00:55:44,842
The evening will decide whose wife
she will be and whose sister-in-law.

777
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:45,425
Done.

778
00:55:46,717 --> 00:55:47,800
Mr. Pyare!

779
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:51,467
Miss Anu! Many happy
returns of the day.

780
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:52,883
Thank you very much!

781
00:55:52,967 --> 00:55:55,133
I.. I..
- Oh sure! Sure!

782
00:55:57,258 --> 00:55:58,342
Thank you!

783
00:55:59,008 --> 00:55:59,675
Mr. Hasmukh!

784
00:55:59,967 --> 00:56:02,425
Happy.. happy birthday to you.

785
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,300
Thank you very much!

786
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:07,717
(Laughing)

787
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,508
Thank you! Excuse me,
I'll be right back.

788
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,800
Excuse me!

789
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,967
It is all right!
- It is not all right!

790
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,925
Hi!
- Hello, how are you?

791
00:56:34,008 --> 00:56:36,342
Yellow and red.
They look beautiful!

792
00:56:36,425 --> 00:56:41,133
Woman is such a wonderful
creation of God.

793
00:56:41,342 --> 00:56:44,342
You like her even when she's angry.
- Yes.

794
00:56:50,633 --> 00:56:52,883
Mr. Pyare, is everything
all right with you?

795
00:56:52,967 --> 00:56:54,758
Yes, everything is fine.

796
00:56:54,925 --> 00:56:56,758
(Laughing)

797
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,842
Excuse me! I will just come.
- Oh yes! Sure! Sure!

798
00:57:01,383 --> 00:57:03,133
Mr. Hasmukh!
- Yes! Yes!

799
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,258
Is everything all right?
- By your grace, it is.

800
00:57:07,342 --> 00:57:08,675
(Laughing)

801
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,675
Excuse me.
- Okay.

802
00:57:21,717 --> 00:57:26,425
Hasmukh, she is paying equal
attention to both of us.

803
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:30,342
I think she loves both of us.

804
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,633
So one of us will have
to sacrifice our love.

805
00:57:39,258 --> 00:57:41,342
But who will make that sacrifice?

806
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,800
We have been to school
and college together.

807
00:57:47,425 --> 00:57:51,300
We have shared our joys and sorrows.

808
00:57:51,592 --> 00:57:57,717
You want our friendship of
years to break for one woman?

809
00:57:58,425 --> 00:57:59,342
No.

810
00:58:00,008 --> 00:58:05,675
That's why I'm saying that
one of us will have to sacrifice.

811
00:58:05,758 --> 00:58:09,592
That is what I'm asking you,
who will make that sacrifice?

812
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:15,217
Who will make the sacrifice?
You will!

813
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,592
I will not make any sacrifice.

814
00:58:17,758 --> 00:58:20,217
You will have to sacrifice!

815
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,258
Are you asking for a sacrifice
or a refund of credit?

816
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,675
Get lost!
Stupid fellow!

817
00:58:25,758 --> 00:58:26,925
Mr. Hasmukh!
- Get lost!

818
00:58:27,008 --> 00:58:29,425
You pushed me? Me?
- Yes!

819
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:33,425
For a love two days old, you
beat an old friend of yours?

820
00:58:33,675 --> 00:58:36,425
I will not spare you!
- Then get into the ring!

821
00:58:36,508 --> 00:58:40,300
Sure! If you are a boxer,
then I am a champion in karate.

822
00:58:40,342 --> 00:58:42,383
Hey, what is happening?

823
00:58:42,467 --> 00:58:45,092
Hey, what are you doing?

824
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:48,175
Hold me, or I will break his head.

825
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:51,467
Please uncle! Control yourself!
Why are you two fighting?

826
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:53,342
On the issue of marriage.

827
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:57,425
But whose marriage?
I forgot.

828
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:01,925
Hasmukh, what were we fighting over?

829
00:59:02,008 --> 00:59:02,758
Yes.

830
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:05,133
Why this fight for the first
time among old friends?

831
00:59:05,217 --> 00:59:08,383
Whose marriage were you talking about?
- Munnu's marriage!

832
00:59:08,467 --> 00:59:10,258
I told him that since Munnu
loves his daughter...

833
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:14,092
we will now become relatives.
But he got angry on me.

834
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:16,467
I'm bound to get angry.
I have only one daughter.

835
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:19,842
Getting her married to your
son would be sending her to hell.

836
00:59:19,925 --> 00:59:24,217
You're insulting my brother
in public! Enough of your nonsense!

837
00:59:25,467 --> 00:59:32,092
Bunnu, wait. Uncle, before giving your
decision, ask how your daughter feels.

838
00:59:32,175 --> 00:59:34,050
She loves me very much.

839
00:59:34,633 --> 00:59:37,675
No, daddy.
Love? With you?

840
00:59:37,925 --> 00:59:40,217
Ritu and I hate you both.

841
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,425
Hey, listen!

842
00:59:44,008 --> 00:59:45,342
(Music Playing)

843
00:59:59,425 --> 01:00:04,800
(Singing) "We will give up our lives
at your doorstep."

844
01:00:04,883 --> 01:00:10,050
"We will give up our lives
at your doorstep."

845
01:00:10,217 --> 01:00:15,425
"You will remember us
when we won't be here."

846
01:00:15,633 --> 01:00:21,258
"We will give up our lives
at your doorstep."

847
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:28,717
"If you want to die then do it
quickly, we will come to shed tears."

848
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:34,217
"If you want to die then do it
quickly, we will come to shed tears."

849
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:39,300
"We will bring our neighboring
friends also to shed tears."

850
01:00:39,383 --> 01:00:45,092
"If you want to die then do it
quickly, we will come to shed tears."

851
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:41,925
"All that I say is lies but
one thing is the truth."

852
01:01:42,008 --> 01:01:46,967
"You are so nice that I
cannot live without you."

853
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:57,175
"All that I say is lies but
one thing is the truth."

854
01:01:57,258 --> 01:02:02,217
"You are so nice that I
cannot live without you."

855
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:06,925
"Deceit is in his nature,
how can you be loyal?"

856
01:02:07,217 --> 01:02:12,300
"Those who have deceived us
earlier, will later too deceive us."

857
01:02:12,342 --> 01:02:17,467
"My dear, even deceit
is allowed in love."

858
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:21,925
"Everything is fair
in love and war."

859
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:27,175
"I agree that there are many
cheaters in this world."

860
01:02:27,508 --> 01:02:32,300
"But deceit is not good in love."

861
01:02:32,342 --> 01:02:37,342
"I agree that there are many
cheaters in this world."

862
01:02:37,717 --> 01:02:42,342
"But deceit is not good in love."

863
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:47,592
"If you refuse then where
else will we go?"

864
01:02:47,675 --> 01:02:52,883
"If you refuse then where
else will we go?"

865
01:02:53,175 --> 01:02:58,092
"We will die and hearing this news
the people at home too will die."

866
01:02:58,175 --> 01:03:03,133
"We will give up our lives
at your doorstep."

867
01:03:03,217 --> 01:03:08,342
"You will remember us
when we won't be here."

868
01:03:08,425 --> 01:03:13,758
"We will give up our lives
at your doorstep."

869
01:04:03,508 --> 01:04:08,883
"If I attain your love before I die."

870
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:11,383
"I would be the groom and
you would be the bride..

871
01:04:11,467 --> 01:04:14,300
..it would be so much fun."

872
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:23,758
"If I attain your love before I die."

873
01:04:23,842 --> 01:04:26,592
"I would be the groom and
you would be the bride..

874
01:04:26,675 --> 01:04:29,092
..it would be so much fun."

875
01:04:29,175 --> 01:04:33,883
"Those people are cowards
who commit suicide."

876
01:04:34,217 --> 01:04:38,842
"The brave ones snatch their
love from the world."

877
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:44,217
"I just have a first
and a last wish."

878
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:48,842
"I just want to be your groom."

879
01:04:49,175 --> 01:04:53,842
"My wish is the same as your wish."

880
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:58,800
"From today we are for each other!"

881
01:04:58,883 --> 01:05:04,175
"My wish is the same as your wish."

882
01:05:04,258 --> 01:05:08,842
"From today we are for each other!"

883
01:05:08,925 --> 01:05:14,008
"Now that you love me,
I will not need anything else."

884
01:05:14,092 --> 01:05:19,175
"Now that you love me,
I will not need anything else."

885
01:05:19,467 --> 01:05:24,175
"I will die and again become
alive in your love."

886
01:05:24,258 --> 01:05:29,258
"At your doorstep I will bring
the marriage procession."

887
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:34,258
"At your doorstep I will bring
the marriage procession."

888
01:05:34,633 --> 01:05:39,300
"I will come on a horse
and take you away."

889
01:05:39,342 --> 01:05:44,592
"At your doorstep I will bring
the marriage procession."

890
01:06:03,467 --> 01:06:06,467
That's your car, isn't it?
Who are they?

891
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:10,133
Acquaintances. Stay here,
we'll be right back.

892
01:06:10,217 --> 01:06:11,425
You wait here; we will
shout at them and come.

893
01:06:11,508 --> 01:06:14,883
Hello! What brings you'll here?

894
01:06:14,967 --> 01:06:19,967
We are taking your car.
Repay our loans within two days...

895
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:24,717
or we will sell this
car and recover our money.

896
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,342
Don't threaten us. We will throw
your money on your face tomorrow.

897
01:06:27,425 --> 01:06:29,300
He means to say that we will
return your money.

898
01:06:29,342 --> 01:06:33,425
But today, don't take...
- Look, if we speak loudly...

899
01:06:33,717 --> 01:06:37,550
you'll lose face. So quietly
allow us to take the car. Get that?

900
01:06:37,633 --> 01:06:40,008
These girls are here or...

901
01:06:40,092 --> 01:06:44,717
Drive carefully! Munnu, it's
good you gave them the car.

902
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,883
One mustn't break a poor man's heart.
- But who were these poor men?

903
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:50,633
They live in the shanties
behind our bungalow.

904
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:54,425
There's a wedding
in their family tomorrow.

905
01:06:54,508 --> 01:06:57,008
They thought of taking
the wedding procession in a car.

906
01:06:57,092 --> 01:07:00,925
So I gave them my car.
- I wasn't ready to give them the car

907
01:07:01,092 --> 01:07:08,092
But it was only after meeting you
that I realized what marriage is.

908
01:07:08,175 --> 01:07:09,342
So I agreed to give them the car.

909
01:07:09,467 --> 01:07:11,550
Now what do we do?
- Steal.

910
01:08:07,092 --> 01:08:11,300
Thief!
- What are you doing!

911
01:08:11,342 --> 01:08:14,300
Mr. Rai, I have come to steal
here at their insistence.

912
01:08:14,383 --> 01:08:18,300
You dare to lie!
You dare to fool daddy!

913
01:08:18,592 --> 01:08:21,133
The lowliest of man will not steal
in his own house. Isn't it, dad?

914
01:08:21,467 --> 01:08:24,008
Mr. Rai, I swear...
Mr. Rai!

915
01:08:25,092 --> 01:08:28,592
Before wearing your gloves,
listen to this.

916
01:08:28,925 --> 01:08:30,925
What! In your own house?

917
01:08:31,092 --> 01:08:34,508
Yes. Our old man will
not simply give us money.

918
01:08:34,842 --> 01:08:38,425
If father's wealth is not used by
his sons, it will rot in the vaults.

919
01:08:38,508 --> 01:08:42,217
If we steal in someone else's
house, we will go to jail.

920
01:08:42,383 --> 01:08:45,925
But if we get caught in our own
house, we'll say we were joking.

921
01:08:49,883 --> 01:08:53,508
I knew I could not trust you.

922
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:57,050
That is why I taped this to
protect myself. Look.

923
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:58,842
Look at it.

924
01:09:00,633 --> 01:09:05,092
Mr. Rai, it is not my fault.
It was on their insistence...

925
01:09:05,258 --> 01:09:08,175
If they ask you to jump
in a well, will you?

926
01:09:13,592 --> 01:09:15,217
Locked...?
- Try fleeing.

927
01:09:15,842 --> 01:09:17,050
A lock here too?

928
01:09:17,467 --> 01:09:20,550
Bunnu, all routes to
our escape are locked.

929
01:09:20,633 --> 01:09:23,050
Who locked all doors?
- I have.

930
01:09:24,008 --> 01:09:27,967
So that before throwing you out of
the house, I give you a good thrashing

931
01:09:29,175 --> 01:09:32,467
You have been very evil today.
- How true!

932
01:09:32,717 --> 01:09:34,717
You robbed your own house?
- Sorry dad.

933
01:09:34,925 --> 01:09:36,758
You'll go for a bigger heist next.
- Oh come on, dad.

934
01:09:36,842 --> 01:09:40,217
Then you'll have me murdered.
- No, you're our father after all.

935
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:43,008
Only until now. From now on, neither
am I your father, nor are you my sons.

936
01:09:43,092 --> 01:09:45,675
You'll have to keep one relationship,
either of the father, or the sons.

937
01:09:45,758 --> 01:09:48,008
What did you say?
- Or you will regret it.

938
01:09:48,092 --> 01:09:51,092
Or we will do what you
have never even dreamt of.

939
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,008
Hasmukh! Why are you beating
my grandsons?

940
01:09:56,675 --> 01:09:58,592
Grandma, save us!

941
01:09:58,717 --> 01:10:02,425
You think yourself
to be a great boxer!

942
01:10:02,717 --> 01:10:05,717
Give one glove each to my
grandsons, then you'll know.

943
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:07,133
Stop!

944
01:10:07,758 --> 01:10:10,633
Take the gloves and fulfill
the desire of your grandma.

945
01:10:10,717 --> 01:10:13,300
No daddy, how can we fight with you?

946
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:14,217
Come on!

947
01:10:33,967 --> 01:10:35,842
Let's take the back-door out!

(Car Approaching)

949
01:10:50,258 --> 01:10:51,592
Where were you taking the car?

950
01:10:52,175 --> 01:10:55,633
This is not your uncle's car,
neither is it of those two monkeys.

951
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,425
They must have jumped
the back wall and escaped.

952
01:10:59,717 --> 01:11:01,800
Now your punishment is that
you will stay here with me.

953
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:07,842
Give me the key... and come
inside or I'll thrash you.

954
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:21,633
Can't you see!

955
01:11:21,717 --> 01:11:24,675
What are you doing?
You should take care of the child.

956
01:11:24,967 --> 01:11:28,342
Do you know whose child this is?
- Whosoever's! A child is a child.

957
01:11:28,425 --> 01:11:31,467
He is the chief minister's son.
- So what?... What!!

958
01:11:38,258 --> 01:11:41,675
I don't know how to thank you.

959
01:11:42,717 --> 01:11:46,300
You put your lives at stake
and saved my son.

960
01:11:48,592 --> 01:11:50,675
I can never repay this favour.

961
01:11:50,925 --> 01:11:54,675
If I can ever be of any help to
you, I'll be very happy to oblige.

962
01:11:55,425 --> 01:11:56,925
Thank you! Thank you!

963
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:02,883
It is we who are pleased that
we could meet you on this pretext.

964
01:12:02,967 --> 01:12:07,925
We never imagined even in our dreams
that we would have tea with you.

965
01:12:08,633 --> 01:12:12,550
Not just tea, you must even
have dinner with us today.

966
01:12:12,633 --> 01:12:15,633
Of course.
- That wasn't necessary.

967
01:12:16,675 --> 01:12:20,217
It is not just me, but
even Chirag who wants that.

968
01:12:21,342 --> 01:12:24,050
You must join us
for the party tonight.

969
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:30,092
You have given great
joy to a mother today.

970
01:12:31,008 --> 01:12:33,092
Today is Chirag's birthday.
- What?!

971
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:38,883
Happy birthday, kid.
- May you live long.

972
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:45,467
If you don't come for the party,
I will not cut the cake.

973
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:49,133
We will surely come.

974
01:12:49,633 --> 01:12:51,175
You are so sweet!

975
01:12:51,675 --> 01:12:54,425
He has already
become friends with you.

976
01:12:54,508 --> 01:12:57,300
Excuse me sir, the party workers
are waiting for you.

977
01:12:57,592 --> 01:13:02,383
Even the press is going to arrive.
- Did they have to come now?

978
01:13:03,675 --> 01:13:08,217
What is the matter, sir?
- You must be reading in the papers...

979
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,925
that bank robberies and
kidnapping cases are on the rise.

980
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:14,758
The government is answerable. It is
important, else I'd have sat with you.

We're from the press. We got an
appointment with the chief minister.

994
01:14:07,592 --> 01:14:08,883
Just a minute.

995
01:14:11,175 --> 01:14:13,467
Hello...
Some press persons are here.

996

They say they have an
appointment with the CM.

997

- Okay.

01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:51,133
Scoundrels!

1006
01:15:51,217 --> 01:15:52,967
(Car Brakes Squeaking)

1007
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,175
Are you all right sir?

1008
01:15:58,758 --> 01:16:00,550
(Car Brakes Squeaking)

1009
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:33,342
(Door Opens)

1010
01:16:34,217 --> 01:16:35,758
(Door Closes)

1011
01:16:40,217 --> 01:16:42,883
(Footsteps Receding)

1012
01:17:12,675 --> 01:17:15,883
(Fighting Sound)

1013
01:18:00,633 --> 01:18:01,633
Bunnu!

1014
01:18:10,008 --> 01:18:12,342
Bunnu, what's going on here?
- Hush.

1015
01:18:31,842 --> 01:18:34,175
The chief minister...?
But he is...

1016
01:18:35,425 --> 01:18:41,508
Who says there are no
good doctors in India?

1017
01:18:43,467 --> 01:18:45,300
Hey Tinu!

1018
01:18:47,508 --> 01:18:49,633
Buddy, great!

1019
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:53,008
Something terrible is going on here.
- That's true.

1020
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,217
Exactly like the chief minister.

1021
01:18:56,467 --> 01:18:59,800
Great job done, doctors!
Not just the world,...

1022
01:19:00,092 --> 01:19:03,592
even if the CM himself sees this,
he will be shocked.

1023
01:19:03,717 --> 01:19:08,300
Well done, doctors!
You have made our dreams come true.

1024
01:19:08,592 --> 01:19:11,342
You must be rewarded
for the great job done.

1025
01:19:12,092 --> 01:19:14,425
(Gun Firing)

1026
01:19:15,425 --> 01:19:19,050
The CM must have got admitted
to the hospital by now.

1027
01:19:19,592 --> 01:19:22,592
That is the only place from
where he can be kidnapped and...

1028
01:19:23,508 --> 01:19:26,800
Sarang put in his place.

1029
01:19:28,008 --> 01:19:29,342
(Gun Firing)

1030
01:20:17,175 --> 01:20:19,633
Munnu, run away!

1031
01:20:19,967 --> 01:20:20,925
(Gun Firing)

1032
01:20:21,008 --> 01:20:22,717
Bunnu! Bunnu!

1033
01:20:23,217 --> 01:20:26,133
I said go!
- I will not leave you.

1034
01:20:26,217 --> 01:20:29,300
Don't be stupid. It is
very necessary to expose them.

1035
01:20:29,342 --> 01:20:31,758
Or the secret we know
will remain a secret.

1036
01:20:31,842 --> 01:20:36,633
Come what may, I will not
leave you alone to face death.

1037
01:20:36,717 --> 01:20:39,008
We will live together
and die together.

1038
01:20:39,092 --> 01:20:42,467
Try to understand.
If you escape...

1039
01:20:42,633 --> 01:20:44,550
until I don't tell them about you,
they cannot kill me.

1040
01:20:44,633 --> 01:20:46,717
No, Bunnu.
- If they catch both of us...

1041
01:20:46,883 --> 01:20:48,342
they will kill us.

1042
01:20:48,425 --> 01:20:50,133
(Gun Firing)

1043
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:53,800
Munnu go, for my sake, go!

1044
01:20:53,883 --> 01:20:56,008
No, Bunnu.
- I said go!

1045
01:20:56,092 --> 01:20:59,050
Go and inform the police and daddy.

1046
01:20:59,133 --> 01:21:01,467
And don't worry about me,
I'll come to no harm.

1047
01:21:02,342 --> 01:21:03,967
(Gun Firing)

1048
01:21:04,592 --> 01:21:06,425
(Bike Engine Sound)

1049
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:34,675
(Water Sloshing)

1050
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,550
I don't think he is from the police.

1051
01:21:51,967 --> 01:21:56,050
Whether he is from the police or
not, but he has become a risk for us.

1052
01:21:58,217 --> 01:22:04,050
What you and your friend know was
the result of our month long effort.

1053
01:22:05,175 --> 01:22:09,050
After knowing this secret,
you cannot get out of here alive.

1054
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,550
That is for sure.

1055
01:22:11,842 --> 01:22:17,633
But your death can become easier
if you tell us your friend's name.

1056
01:22:18,342 --> 01:22:20,550
And where he has gone from here.

1057
01:22:22,342 --> 01:22:27,633
Tell us, or you will
die an agonising death.

1058
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:35,300
Do what you like, but I will not
let a rogue like you become the CM.

1059
01:22:36,175 --> 01:22:41,050
I will die, but not reveal my
friend's whereabouts to you.

1060
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:52,967
(Screaming)

1061
01:23:10,675 --> 01:23:14,675
Tell us, darling.
Tell us, please!

1062
01:23:16,467 --> 01:23:18,508
I cannot bear to see you in pain.

1063
01:23:19,425 --> 01:23:20,758
Tell us.

1064
01:23:30,508 --> 01:23:32,550
Daddy! Daddy!

1065
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:34,092
Munnu!

1066
01:23:35,092 --> 01:23:38,883
You're back? Where is Bunnu?
- He is in trouble.

1067
01:23:38,967 --> 01:23:42,675
The whole world is in trouble because
of you, how can you be in trouble?

1068
01:23:42,883 --> 01:23:45,008
Last time you said he lost his memory.
What are you going to say now?

1069
01:23:45,092 --> 01:23:49,050
Believe me, daddy. Some dangerous
gangsters have held Bunnu captive.

1070
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:52,467
They plan to kidnap
the chief minister.

1071
01:23:52,842 --> 01:23:54,342
The chief minister?
- Yes.

1072
01:23:54,508 --> 01:23:55,967
Couldn't you tell a bigger lie?

1073
01:23:56,425 --> 01:24:02,008
Plan to kidnap the prime minister,
the president! You liar!

1074
01:24:02,092 --> 01:24:04,300
I'm telling the truth.
- Shut-up, you swine!

1075
01:24:04,342 --> 01:24:07,133
Grandma, please tell him.

1076
01:24:07,217 --> 01:24:10,967
Until when will you trouble
your father with your pranks?

1077
01:24:11,217 --> 01:24:13,425
You are saying this, grandma?
- Yes!

1078
01:24:13,675 --> 01:24:16,383
It is not right to
always lie like that.

1079
01:24:17,258 --> 01:24:21,175
Then even when you are telling the
truth, people will not believe you.

1080
01:24:21,425 --> 01:24:22,675
Why don't you understand this?

1081
01:24:24,467 --> 01:24:29,883
True, grandma. My truth is being
treated as a lie today.

1082
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:34,675
But Bunnu's life
is really in danger.

1083
01:24:37,467 --> 01:24:38,925
(Footsteps Receding)

1084
01:24:39,592 --> 01:24:42,342
We beat him mercilessly, but
he refuses to reveal anything.

1085
01:24:42,425 --> 01:24:44,300
Then kill him.
Take this.

1086
01:25:08,633 --> 01:25:10,300
(Gun Firing)

1087
01:25:40,967 --> 01:25:42,967
(Gun Firing)

1088
01:25:53,592 --> 01:25:55,300
(Explosion)

1089
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,092
(Explosion)

1090
01:26:05,508 --> 01:26:08,258
(Car Accelerator Sound)

1091
01:26:19,717 --> 01:26:21,092
(Door Closes)

1092
01:26:21,925 --> 01:26:24,383
(Gun Firing)

1093
01:26:25,925 --> 01:26:27,300
(Water Sloshing)

1094
01:26:28,258 --> 01:26:31,383
Uncle! Uncle!
- What is the matter?

1095
01:26:31,675 --> 01:26:35,383
Daddy, leave immediately with
Munnu, he needs your help.

1096
01:26:35,467 --> 01:26:40,300
Why do you'll look so perturbed?
- Only you can help me now.

1097
01:26:40,342 --> 01:26:45,425
No one is believing me. Daddy and
Grandma think I am joking like always

1098
01:26:45,592 --> 01:26:50,050
But this time,
I'm neither joking, nor lying.

1099
01:26:50,217 --> 01:26:53,008
Tell me in short what has happened.

1100
01:26:53,092 --> 01:26:56,842
I am an eye witness
to the attack on the CM.

1101
01:26:57,133 --> 01:26:59,675
What?
- Yes, and I know those criminals.

1102
01:26:59,758 --> 01:27:03,342
I have seen all of them.
I even know where they are.

1103
01:27:03,425 --> 01:27:05,383
They have made a dangerous plan.
- Plan...?

1104
01:27:05,467 --> 01:27:08,883
They want to kidnap the CM and
put his lookalike in his place.

1105
01:27:08,967 --> 01:27:11,633
Look a like?
- He isn't really his look a like but...

1106
01:27:11,717 --> 01:27:15,258
Stop your nonsense, Munnu.
This is not your house...

1107
01:27:15,342 --> 01:27:19,008
but the police station. Do you know
what it means to play pranks here?

1108
01:27:19,217 --> 01:27:23,883
What is the matter?
Why aren't you believing this man?

1109
01:27:24,133 --> 01:27:26,508
Because I know him
since he was small.

1110
01:27:27,258 --> 01:27:31,675
Since their childhood, they
have never said anything but lies.

1111
01:27:32,633 --> 01:27:36,342
They have always troubled their
father, but now this is too much!

1112
01:27:36,467 --> 01:27:41,342
Maybe he is lying, but what if
he says is even one percent true...

1113
01:27:42,008 --> 01:27:43,092
then who will be responsible?

1114
01:27:43,217 --> 01:27:46,425
Sir, believe me, I'm telling
the truth. Please help me.

1115
01:27:46,508 --> 01:27:51,092
My brother is in their custody. Sir,
do something or he may lose his life.

1116
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:54,633
Don't worry, the law is
meant to protect people.

1117
01:27:55,508 --> 01:27:58,092
Besides, this involves
the chief minister.

1118
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:01,133
Truth or lies, we'll
have to go with you.

1119
01:28:06,342 --> 01:28:07,550
(Door Opens)

1120
01:28:07,967 --> 01:28:09,217
Come, sir.

1121
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:10,342
(Door Closes)

1122
01:28:17,967 --> 01:28:23,050
How is this possible?
Priya, everything has changed here.

1123
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:26,258
Everything has changed here.
Neither those gangsters...

1124
01:28:26,342 --> 01:28:28,717
nor my brother is here.
This place has totally changed.

1125
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,925
Sometimes you say
the CM will change,...

1126
01:28:31,342 --> 01:28:34,967
sometimes you say the place has
changed. You are fooling the law.

1127
01:28:35,175 --> 01:28:39,508
Sir, I'd warned you that coming
with him would be waste of time.

1128
01:28:39,592 --> 01:28:42,217
He's a liar!
- I'm not lying.

1129
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:45,675
I'm myself surprised
about the change in this place.

1130
01:28:46,008 --> 01:28:48,675
How can so much change
occur in one night?

1131
01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:01,967
You! You brought the
police here yourself?

1132
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:08,758
Sir, arrest him.
He killed his brother yesterday.

1133
01:29:08,967 --> 01:29:11,508
He was putting the body
in the car and escaping...

1134
01:29:11,592 --> 01:29:15,217
when I tried to catch him.

1135
01:29:15,342 --> 01:29:19,217
He managed to escape,
but I got hold of his coat.

1136
01:29:19,342 --> 01:29:22,550
She is lying! She is an
accomplice of those goons.

1137
01:29:22,717 --> 01:29:25,800
Believe me, this is
a conspiracy against me.

1138
01:29:25,883 --> 01:29:31,508
Hold on! Old woman, how did you know
that the deceased was his brother?

1139
01:29:32,092 --> 01:29:35,383
Because before dying,
he was saying,...

1140
01:29:35,592 --> 01:29:42,008
"Why are you killing me,
I am your brother after all."

1141
01:29:42,175 --> 01:29:45,425
You witch, I will not spare you!

1142
01:29:45,508 --> 01:29:47,883
Where is my brother, tell me!

1143
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:51,008
Leave her.
- Tell me, or I will kill you!

1144
01:29:51,092 --> 01:29:52,008
Arrest him!

1145
01:29:52,592 --> 01:29:56,592
You are making a grave mistake, sir.
Believe me, my brother is alive.

1146
01:29:56,675 --> 01:29:58,758
He is in their custody.

1147
01:29:58,842 --> 01:30:03,383
What are you doing, sir? He is
Munnu, my friend's son, I know him.

1148
01:30:03,550 --> 01:30:06,008
He can tell a thousand lies
but he cannot kill his brother.

1149
01:30:06,342 --> 01:30:08,675
Only this old woman has said this,
we have no other proof.

1150
01:30:08,758 --> 01:30:13,467
Inspector Pyare, I have no personal
enmity with your friend's son.

1151
01:30:14,092 --> 01:30:18,300
But this woman says that she
has seen him kill his brother.

1152
01:30:19,258 --> 01:30:24,383
And until his brother is found,
Munnu will remain in police custody.

1153
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:41,050
(Laughing)

1154
01:30:46,592 --> 01:30:49,550
The body is totally decomposed, sir.
It is very difficult to identify.

1155
01:30:49,633 --> 01:30:53,883
Don't worry, we will know from the
chain and watch found on his body.

1156
01:30:55,592 --> 01:30:58,258
It was difficult for the police
to identify the body found...

1157
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,342
but we have found Bunnu's
watch and chain on the body.

1158
01:31:04,133 --> 01:31:06,717
Inspector, this is a
elaborate prank they are playing.

1159
01:31:06,967 --> 01:31:08,633
Prank?
- Yes.

1160
01:31:08,842 --> 01:31:11,508
When they left home,
they had threatened me...

1161
01:31:11,592 --> 01:31:16,258
that they will do something which
I must never have even dreamt of.

1162
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:17,925
And this is what they have done.

1163
01:31:18,133 --> 01:31:20,342
One put his chain and
watch on some dead body...

1164
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:24,383
and the other went in jail so
that their father becomes frantic.

1165
01:31:24,883 --> 01:31:27,050
But this time I
won't be fooled by them.

1166
01:31:27,133 --> 01:31:28,050
To hell with them!

1167
01:31:32,633 --> 01:31:34,175
Mother!
-Yes!

1168
01:31:34,758 --> 01:31:36,883
I hope what he is saying is true.

1169
01:31:37,883 --> 01:31:42,050
But to say it in short,
the police has found a body.

1170
01:31:42,175 --> 01:31:43,050
Oh God!

1171
01:31:43,258 --> 01:31:45,592
If Bunnu does not present
himself in 2-3 days...

1172
01:31:46,092 --> 01:31:49,300
then he hasn't realised what
big trouble Munnu will fall into.

1173
01:31:55,925 --> 01:32:01,175
Oh God, please let Bunnu
be safe wherever he is.

1174
01:32:01,258 --> 01:32:04,467
God, save me!

1175
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:07,592
(Dogs Barking)

1176
01:32:16,842 --> 01:32:19,800
Damn you, Gauri Shanker!

1177
01:32:19,883 --> 01:32:23,633
This is my twelfth pot you have
broken this month. Scoundrel!

1178
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:26,175
Hey! Where are you coming
in the middle?

1179
01:32:33,258 --> 01:32:35,258
Run Yadav,
my honour is at stake!

1180
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:38,342
This dog is after me! Run! Run!

1181
01:32:40,092 --> 01:32:41,633
Hey brother, what have you done?

1182
01:32:41,717 --> 01:32:44,175
First I broke the pot, then I hung
in the air, and now I'm thrown here.

1183
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:45,300
I am stunned!

1184
01:32:45,425 --> 01:32:48,883
Hey, what is this! No! No!

1185
01:32:51,425 --> 01:32:53,217
Hail Lord Bajrangbali!

1186
01:33:00,217 --> 01:33:04,633
Save me, God.

1187
01:33:07,883 --> 01:33:10,383
Gauri Shanker.
- What happened?

1188
01:33:10,967 --> 01:33:14,842
Come out, Moti has gone.

1189
01:33:14,967 --> 01:33:19,175
He has? The naughty dog!
He acts too smart.

1190
01:33:19,258 --> 01:33:20,383
(Dogs Barking)

1191
01:33:22,133 --> 01:33:23,550
(Laughing)

1192
01:33:25,383 --> 01:33:27,342
Wasn't as nice thing to do.

1193
01:33:45,175 --> 01:33:45,842
(Woman Screams)

1194
01:33:46,217 --> 01:33:48,633
O my God!

1195
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:51,550
Gauri Shanker!
You!

1196
01:33:52,508 --> 01:33:56,008
O God, pardon me, I
have made a grave mistake.

1197
01:33:56,342 --> 01:33:58,342
You are great!

1198
01:33:58,508 --> 01:34:03,800
I suffered a loss, my roof broke,
you saw me in this state...

1199
01:34:03,883 --> 01:34:06,508
and you seek pardon from God?

1200
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:10,883
I'm sorry Chandramukhi, but
this happened because of your dog.

1201
01:34:10,967 --> 01:34:12,800
That is why I fell here by mistake.

1202
01:34:13,175 --> 01:34:17,425
Why didn't you commit
this mistake before, Gauri?

1203
01:34:17,508 --> 01:34:23,008
I'm so helpless.
Look Chanda...

1204
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:26,800
don't try to get
close to me, stay away!

1205
01:34:26,883 --> 01:34:32,133
Don't act smart with me. I'll shout
and collect the whole village here.

1206
01:34:32,592 --> 01:34:36,925
Shameless man, you enter a single
woman's house through the roof.

1207
01:34:37,175 --> 01:34:39,217
Moreover, you threaten her.

1208
01:34:39,508 --> 01:34:45,717
You will have to pay
for this mistake of yours.

1209
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,467
Take what you want
and just leave me alone.

1210
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:52,550
Give me a kiss.

1211
01:34:52,633 --> 01:34:54,842
O my God, such helplessness!

1212
01:34:54,925 --> 01:34:56,092
Kiss...

1213
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:11,008
I didn't know you were so ardent.

1214
01:35:11,217 --> 01:35:16,008
I hadn't expected you to be so
happy at the mention of a kiss.

1215
01:35:17,758 --> 01:35:20,508
Wow!

1216
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:24,217
Is my touch so electrifying?

1217
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:27,467
O my God!

1218
01:35:27,633 --> 01:35:31,383
Chandramukhi! Oh my God!
- Gauri!

1219
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:37,008
Uncle, Gauri Shanker
broke my pot again today.

1220
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:38,883
Good God!

1221
01:35:41,758 --> 01:35:46,883
I am fed up of
putting sense into him.

1222
01:35:47,342 --> 01:35:49,717
It is not difficult
to put sense into him.

1223
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:53,717
If you allow me, I
can do it in a minute.

1224
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,300
Do what?

1225
01:35:55,633 --> 01:36:00,175
Will you knock sense into me?
- He misbehaved, and now he threatens

1226
01:36:00,258 --> 01:36:03,217
Why are you talking
to father, talk to me.

1227
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:06,758
I know everything. You instigate
these people and bring them here.

1228
01:36:06,842 --> 01:36:12,508
Stop this act of yours or if
I get angry, you'll regret it.

1229
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:16,425
What can you do to
us if you get angry?

1230
01:36:17,050 --> 01:36:21,092
What can you do?
- Nothing, I'll just break your jaw!

1231
01:36:21,508 --> 01:36:25,758
Leave him, or I'll kill myself.

1232
01:36:25,842 --> 01:36:28,300
What are you doing, father?
- Don't touch me!

1233
01:36:29,175 --> 01:36:34,467
You will ruin me one day.
I am sick of your antics!

1234
01:36:35,342 --> 01:36:39,467
Therefore, I close my doors on you.

1235
01:36:40,383 --> 01:36:45,092
No room for you in my house. Get out!
- Going.

1236
01:36:45,175 --> 01:36:47,258
Then go.
- I'm going!

1237
01:36:47,467 --> 01:36:50,758
What do you think, that if you
throw me out, I'll go hungry?

1238
01:36:51,008 --> 01:36:53,842
There are many who will feed me.
- Get lost!

1239
01:36:54,175 --> 01:36:57,758
You don't need to lecture me
before the villagers. - Gauri Shanker!

1240
01:36:57,842 --> 01:37:02,550
What Gauri Shanker? He throws me
out of the house on every pretext.

1241
01:37:02,675 --> 01:37:06,967
Always telling me to get out,
get lost! As if I had no respect.

1242
01:37:07,258 --> 01:37:11,883
I knew beforehand that I'm going
to be thrown out. I'm going.

1243
01:37:16,592 --> 01:37:19,717
Did you find Gauri?

1244
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,092
No uncle, we looked around the
whole village, but couldn't find him.

1245
01:37:24,342 --> 01:37:28,592
You eat your dinner, uncle.
You have gone hungry all day.

1246
01:37:28,675 --> 01:37:32,842
My hunger has left with Gauri.

1247
01:37:33,342 --> 01:37:35,883
Then why did you have to
throw me out of the house? - Gauri!

1248
01:37:37,217 --> 01:37:42,175
First you throw me out of the
house, then you cry over me.

1249
01:37:43,133 --> 01:37:46,675
Why simply create a scene?
- All right, now that you are back...

1250
01:37:46,758 --> 01:37:49,717
have mercy on us.
Come inside and eat.

1251
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:52,883
I don't want to eat! My stomach
is full after hearing his abuses.

1252
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:58,300
All right, pardon him,
he will never scold you again.

1253
01:37:58,592 --> 01:38:01,467
Look, uncle is full of remorse.

1254
01:38:03,258 --> 01:38:06,092
Uncle...
- That is what I don't like about you

1255
01:38:06,258 --> 01:38:08,883
I haven't eaten, but you haven't
even ensured that my father has eaten.

1256
01:38:08,967 --> 01:38:11,300
I am a young man,
I can bear hunger.

1257
01:38:11,633 --> 01:38:16,092
You should at least have served my
father. See how sullen he looks.

1258
01:38:17,175 --> 01:38:18,967
Let us go and eat, father.

1259
01:38:19,425 --> 01:38:21,092
I will tie the cow and come.

1260
01:38:21,175 --> 01:38:22,467
Uncle!
-Yes!

1261
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:27,342
I haven't seen this
kind of love anywhere.

1262
01:38:27,675 --> 01:38:31,883
I have no one but Gauri.

1263
01:38:32,842 --> 01:38:36,925
I was small when I got separated
from my mother and twin brother.

1264
01:38:38,342 --> 01:38:43,383
And then one day,
even Gauri's mother died.

1265
01:38:44,717 --> 01:38:48,300
Now there is just me and Gauri.

1266
01:38:49,175 --> 01:38:54,758
And so that our love isn't jinxed,
I put a black spot on Gauri's cheek.

1267
01:38:55,925 --> 01:39:00,467
Uncle, don't worry.

1268
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:05,883
I have managed to woo him a little.
I'll take care of the rest.

1269
01:39:05,967 --> 01:39:10,675
(Music Playing)

1270
01:39:17,425 --> 01:39:24,258
(Singing) "Your father is in
the courtyard and mother at the door."

1271
01:39:24,717 --> 01:39:31,258
"Your father is in the courtyard
and mother at the door."

1272
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:34,967
"Oh my beloved how can I
come into your house?"

1273
01:39:42,925 --> 01:39:47,300
"Your father is in the courtyard
and mother at the door."

1274
01:39:47,342 --> 01:39:51,217
"Your father is in the courtyard
and mother at the door."

1275
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:54,925
"Oh my beloved how can I
come into your house?"

1276
01:39:55,175 --> 01:39:58,842
"Oh my beloved how can I
come into your house?"

1277
01:39:58,925 --> 01:40:02,675
"My father has gone to the fields
and mother has gone to the market."

1278
01:40:02,883 --> 01:40:06,425
"My father has gone to the fields
and mother has gone to the market."

1279
01:40:06,508 --> 01:40:10,300
"Oh my beloved, you come in
I am alone in the house."

1280
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:14,550
"Oh my beloved, you come in
I am alone in the house."

1281
01:40:37,217 --> 01:40:41,092
"What will you feed me if
I come to your house?"

1282
01:40:41,175 --> 01:40:45,300
"What will you feed me if
I come to your house?"

1283
01:40:49,008 --> 01:40:52,883
"What will you feed me if
I come to your house?"

1284
01:40:52,967 --> 01:40:57,300
"I will cook for you hot porridge
and fried pancakes."

1285
01:41:00,633 --> 01:41:04,342
"I will feed you with
my soft hands."

1286
01:41:04,592 --> 01:41:08,342
"I will feed you with
my soft hands."

1287
01:41:08,425 --> 01:41:12,342
"Your father is in the courtyard
and mother at the door."

1288
01:41:12,425 --> 01:41:16,300
"Your father is in the courtyard
and mother at the door."

1289
01:41:16,342 --> 01:41:20,133
"Oh my beloved how can I
come into your house?"

1290
01:41:20,217 --> 01:41:24,342
"Oh my beloved how can I
come into your house?"

1291
01:41:59,050 --> 01:42:03,008
"If I eat porridge and fries pancakes
then I will feel sleepy."

1292
01:42:03,092 --> 01:42:07,300
"If I eat porridge and fries pancakes
then I will feel sleepy."

1293
01:42:10,425 --> 01:42:14,800
"If I eat porridge and fries pancakes
then I will feel sleepy."

1294
01:42:14,883 --> 01:42:19,300
"I will spread my veil
on the bed for you."

1295
01:42:21,342 --> 01:42:25,300
"Oh my beloved come and
make the bed sacred!"

1296
01:42:25,342 --> 01:42:29,008
"Oh my beloved come and
make the bed sacred!"

1297

and mother has gone to the market."

and mother has gone to the market."

1299

I am alone in the house."

1300
01:42:40,758 --> 01:42:44,717
"Oh my beloved, you come in
I am alone in the house."

1301
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:10,842
"What will happen if your mother
comes from the market?"

1302
01:43:10,925 --> 01:43:14,550
"What will happen if your mother
comes from the market?"

1303

"What will happen if your mother
comes from the market?"

1304

"I will tell my mother that
this is your son-in-law."

1305

"Oh beloved, come and ask
for my hand in marriage."

1306

come into your house?"

1324
01:46:56,592 --> 01:46:57,967

Just see!

1326
01:47:02,925 --> 01:47:03,383
Hello!

1327
01:47:03,467 --> 01:47:06,092
Sir, Munnu has escaped
from the lock up.

1328
01:47:06,342 --> 01:47:10,342
What! That means you helped the man
who is accused of murder escape?

1329
01:47:11,342 --> 01:47:14,675
My God! Oh my God!

1330
01:47:15,008 --> 01:47:17,008
I am sorry, sir!
I am really very sorry.

1331
01:47:17,175 --> 01:47:20,300
Inspector Pyare Mohan,
you have been bribed.

1332
01:47:20,425 --> 01:47:24,425
Have I...?
- But remember, if he's not caught...

1333
01:47:24,508 --> 01:47:28,133
you will spend
all your life in jail.

1334
01:47:28,217 --> 01:47:30,467
Jail!

1335
01:47:30,758 --> 01:47:34,092
Stay there, I'm coming.
- I understand, sir.

1336
01:47:34,175 --> 01:47:36,675
You are coming here
and I'm running away.

1337
01:47:36,758 --> 01:47:39,217
Hello...
The swine!

1338
01:47:39,383 --> 01:47:44,050
You have become useless, DCP!

1339
01:47:44,592 --> 01:47:47,175
You could not kill an ordinary guy?

1340
01:47:47,675 --> 01:47:49,342
He has managed to
escape from your custody!

1341
01:47:50,050 --> 01:47:53,008
You have corrupt men
like you in the police.

1342
01:47:53,092 --> 01:47:55,342
He is not corrupt, only foolish.

1343
01:47:56,258 --> 01:48:00,258
I kept him on duty so
that our work becomes easier.

1344
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:04,300
You should have killed him
then itself, but you...

1345
01:48:04,842 --> 01:48:07,342
You planned to get him
killed in the lock up...

1346
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,633
so that no one suspects you.

1347
01:48:10,008 --> 01:48:16,300
The scoundrel has escaped. Find
him! He is too dangerous for us.

1348
01:48:16,717 --> 01:48:19,592
Our planning of several
years can come to naught.

1349
01:48:28,217 --> 01:48:29,758
Who is it?

1350
01:48:34,217 --> 01:48:36,300
Pyare! Where did you come from?

1351
01:48:37,383 --> 01:48:38,925
Through the window?

1352
01:48:39,217 --> 01:48:42,092
You sneak into my house in the middle
of the night like thieves? What for?

1353
01:48:42,342 --> 01:48:47,717
Your son has shut all doors for me,
so I had to come through the window.

1354
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,592
I cannot even go home, the
police is standing guard even there.

1355
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:55,342
Your son has ruined me completely.

1356
01:48:55,383 --> 01:48:58,008
But what has my grandson done?

1357
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:02,758
I forgot again.
- You were talking about my son.

1358
01:49:03,425 --> 01:49:06,925
Oh yes! He escaped from the lock up.

1359
01:49:07,050 --> 01:49:11,175
What!
- Yes. I informed the DCP.

1360
01:49:11,342 --> 01:49:15,342
Now the DCP is accusing
me of accepting a bribe.

1361
01:49:15,467 --> 01:49:20,258
Sir, the Deputy Commissioner is here.
- The DCP! I've had it.

1362
01:49:20,425 --> 01:49:24,883
Hush! Control yourself.
I'll take care of him.

1363
01:49:25,883 --> 01:49:30,133
What's going on? Why is the
police parading in my house?

1364
01:49:30,217 --> 01:49:32,758
Because your son has
escaped from the lock up.

1365
01:49:32,925 --> 01:49:34,258
But how?

1366
01:49:34,342 --> 01:49:38,467
Because of the foolish inspector
Pyare, who is also your friend.

1367
01:49:38,967 --> 01:49:43,175
Now even he is an offender, and we're
looking for him along with your son.

1368
01:49:43,425 --> 01:49:45,342
Coffee, sir!
- No, thank you!

1369
01:49:48,883 --> 01:49:53,467
What happened?
- I'm drowsy, my eyes ache.

1370
01:49:53,550 --> 01:49:55,883
Have coffee, sir.
- This ass will be caught!

1371
01:49:55,967 --> 01:49:57,758
Who is an ass?
- Who did you call an ass?

1372
01:49:57,842 --> 01:50:02,008
My friend. He acts so foolish,
he will be caught one day.

1373
01:50:02,092 --> 01:50:04,717
What are you doing here?
We don't want coffee, leave!

1374
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,300
Unnecessarily, I do not
like coffee at all!

1375
01:50:06,383 --> 01:50:09,925
I'm telling you, I'm alone at home.
- Sir, there is no one here.

1376
01:50:10,008 --> 01:50:12,758
I told you.
Sir, can you come aside please?

1377
01:50:14,342 --> 01:50:19,300
My son has not done anything,
he plays such pranks to trouble me.

1378
01:50:19,633 --> 01:50:21,758
Do something to stop the police
from chasing him.

1379
01:50:21,842 --> 01:50:24,842
I'll pay you the price you name.
- What nonsense?

1380
01:50:25,592 --> 01:50:28,008
I don't take bribes.
- You don't?

1381
01:50:29,217 --> 01:50:32,467
Surprising. Your face
makes one assume you do.

1382
01:50:32,550 --> 01:50:34,217
What?
- Forget that.

1383
01:50:34,300 --> 01:50:38,300
Sir, my son is innocent...
- Your son is not innocent.

1384
01:50:38,842 --> 01:50:40,883
He is a very big offender of law.

1385
01:50:41,175 --> 01:50:45,300
It is better that he surrenders
himself to the police soonest...

1386
01:50:45,925 --> 01:50:47,592
or he will regret it.

1387
01:50:47,758 --> 01:50:51,883
Listen! You two will keep a round
the clock watch on this house.

1388
01:50:52,508 --> 01:50:54,675
He will surely come to
meet his father one day.

1389
01:50:54,967 --> 01:50:57,800
And as soon as he comes, inform me.

1390
01:50:58,842 --> 01:51:00,175
Good night! Come!

1391
01:51:01,175 --> 01:51:03,258
(Footsteps Receding)

1392
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,258
Have patience, Munnu. God willing,
everything will be all right.

1393
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:16,300
Nothing will be all right. The goons
who can trap me in a murder case...

1394
01:51:16,508 --> 01:51:19,758
those who can barge into the
police station and try to kill me...

1395
01:51:20,050 --> 01:51:22,592
wonder what those cruel men
must have done to my brother.

1396
01:51:23,258 --> 01:51:25,508
I don't even know if
Bunnu is alive or...

1397
01:51:25,592 --> 01:51:27,342
Munnu!

1398
01:51:28,258 --> 01:51:32,133
I don't know what to do. Where
do I look for those criminals?

1399
01:51:32,925 --> 01:51:36,008
How do I find out how Bunnu is?

1400
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:39,675
There is one place
where we can catch them.

1401
01:51:40,425 --> 01:51:44,425
You said they are going to put an
impostor in CM's place in hospital.

1402
01:51:44,717 --> 01:51:49,592
If we go there, we can catch them.
We can even save the CM.

1403
01:51:56,925 --> 01:51:58,717
He is doctor Goyal from Delhi!
- Okay.

1404
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:01,467
He has come to examine the
CM on our personal request.

1405
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:05,383
I see. Pradhan, take him along.
- Come, sir.

1406
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:13,800
(Footsteps Receding)

1407
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:28,758
Doctor!

1408
01:52:30,758 --> 01:52:32,383
(Door Opens)

1409
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,258
Doctor Goyal from Delhi!

1410
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:41,633
Excuse me, sir!

1411
01:52:47,175 --> 01:52:48,300
(Car Brakes Squeaking)

1412
01:52:59,342 --> 01:53:00,467
(Door Opens)

1413
01:53:05,717 --> 01:53:07,175
Thank you!

1414
01:53:09,758 --> 01:53:11,717
Hello, sir!
- Hello!

1415
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:32,300
Please.

1416
01:53:51,675 --> 01:53:53,258
(Door Opens)

1417
01:54:01,175 --> 01:54:03,967
Pradhan, there is a call for you.
- Thank you, sir!

1418
01:54:22,758 --> 01:54:26,217
What are you saying, Munnu?
- Believe me, Mr. Vinod.

1419
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:29,508
They are going to plant an impostor
in place of the CM in the hospital.

1420
01:54:29,592 --> 01:54:31,717
Some of the hospital
staff is also involved.

1421
01:55:09,133 --> 01:55:09,925
Hurry!

1422
01:55:10,342 --> 01:55:11,342
Let him in.

1423
01:55:25,133 --> 01:55:26,550
(Footsteps Receding)

1424
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:31,425
Sir!
- Yes.

1425
01:55:31,508 --> 01:55:34,050
Something terrible has
been planned in this hospital.

1426
01:55:38,383 --> 01:55:40,050
You all please go out.

1427
01:55:50,675 --> 01:55:53,008
You tell him, I'll close the door.

1428
01:55:55,092 --> 01:55:57,967
Do you recognise me, sir?
I'm Munnu.

1429
01:55:58,633 --> 01:56:01,300
I know who killed your wife and son.

1430
01:56:01,883 --> 01:56:05,425
They are very dangerous. Even my
brother Bunnu is in their custody.

1431
01:56:05,758 --> 01:56:08,217
And the most important
thing is that...

1432
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:11,925
using plastic surgery they've made one
of their men to look just like you

1433
01:56:12,217 --> 01:56:15,050
They want to substitute you.

1434
01:56:24,175 --> 01:56:27,258
Munnu, you were a
bit late in coming here.

1435
01:56:27,883 --> 01:56:30,508
The CM has already been changed.

1436
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:31,675
(Gun Firing)

1437
01:56:32,758 --> 01:56:36,175
(Fighting Sound)

(Glass Shatters)

1439
01:56:56,717 --> 01:56:58,467
(Gun Firing)

1440
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:09,592
Sir, you can arrest me
if you like...

1441
01:57:09,883 --> 01:57:13,550
but please believe me,
that rogue is the fake CM.

1442
01:57:13,717 --> 01:57:15,883
I know that the CM is fake.

1443
01:57:22,467 --> 01:57:24,217
(Car Accelerator Sound)

1444
01:57:25,550 --> 01:57:27,092
(Gun Firing)

1445
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:32,383
Scoundrel!

1446
01:57:32,675 --> 01:57:39,133
You scoundrels!
Why have you'll brought me here?

1447
01:57:39,967 --> 01:57:42,175
What do you want?

1448
01:57:45,175 --> 01:57:48,467
You'll be told everything when
the time comes. Take him away!

1449
01:57:55,133 --> 01:57:59,967
Tinu, make the security more tight,
no one should manage to come here.

1450
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:01,217
(Car Brakes Squeaking)

1451
01:58:03,133 --> 01:58:08,550
You? I'd told you
not to try to meet me.

1452
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:12,967
That I will contact you myself when
the time comes. Didn't I tell you?

1453
01:58:13,050 --> 01:58:19,300
When will the time come? After
my brother dies behind the bars?

1454
01:58:20,383 --> 01:58:22,967
He is being tortured
more and more every day.

1455
01:58:23,175 --> 01:58:25,383
He is not being
allowed to sleep all night.

1456
01:58:25,550 --> 01:58:27,592
His condition is terrible.

1457
01:58:28,550 --> 01:58:31,800
I don't understand what you
all are doing since so many days.

1458
01:58:31,925 --> 01:58:36,092
It is not child's play to get your
brother out of jail. it'll take time.

1459
01:58:36,633 --> 01:58:40,050
Half our job has been done.
The CM is in our custody...

1460
01:58:40,133 --> 01:58:42,592
and our man Sarang
put in his place.

1461
01:58:43,133 --> 01:58:45,300
Very soon, Sarang will get
discharged from hospital...

1462
01:58:45,633 --> 01:58:47,717
and take the CM's charge.

1463
01:58:47,967 --> 01:58:50,967
Your brother will then be a free man.
We'll have no problem.

1464
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:54,467
There is one problem.
That boy.

1465
01:58:55,550 --> 01:58:57,883
He has escaped your hands twice.

1466
01:58:58,550 --> 01:59:00,717
He may become the reason
for your death the third time.

1467
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,300
No one can cause my death!

1468
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:07,800
Until now, he was after us,
but now, we will go after him.

1469
01:59:08,133 --> 01:59:12,300
The moment we have him, we will
send him where we sent his brother.

1470
01:59:15,467 --> 01:59:16,050
Go now.

1471
01:59:16,467 --> 01:59:22,467
Mother, don't worry. I am sure
Bunnu will come to no harm.

1472
01:59:22,967 --> 01:59:27,800
Even I think so.
- Nothing untoward will happen.

1473
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:33,633
I have an idea which will bring
Bunnu back from wherever he is.

1474
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:36,633
Have a look, uncle. We will
publish this matter in the newspaper.

1475
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:39,592
"Dear Bunnu, your grandma
is very worried about you."

1476
01:59:39,758 --> 01:59:43,133
"Your father has also taken ill."
- God forbid!

1477
01:59:43,217 --> 01:59:45,342
That's written only for effect.

1478
01:59:45,467 --> 01:59:49,842
"Wherever you are, please come back.
No questions will be asked."

1479
01:59:50,342 --> 01:59:52,133
I will even thrash him!

1480
01:59:54,050 --> 01:59:57,633
"One who brings this man on
the address given below,..."

1481
01:59:58,175 --> 02:00:00,508
"will be given a
reward of 50,000."

1482
02:00:02,092 --> 02:00:05,175
He will come back
only if he is alive!

1483
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:09,175
Munnu! My brother!

1484
02:00:09,258 --> 02:00:12,300
Laxmi, he has regained consciousness.
- Really?

1485
02:00:12,717 --> 02:00:15,842
Are you all right now?
- How did I come here?

1486
02:00:15,925 --> 02:00:18,342
I brought you here. You were
floating unconscious in the sea.

1487
02:00:18,925 --> 02:00:23,175
The bullet just grazed your arm.
I have bandaged it.

1488
02:00:23,425 --> 02:00:27,550
Why did you get shot?
- Why did you get shot?

1489
02:00:31,883 --> 02:00:32,550
Shot...?

1490
02:00:32,633 --> 02:00:33,717
(Gun Firing)

1491
02:00:50,633 --> 02:00:54,508
What will you do with an expensive
chain and watch after death?

1492
02:01:03,217 --> 02:01:07,883
You want to wear my watch
and chain? Wear my shirt too.

1493
02:01:08,217 --> 02:01:11,883
Wear it.
I said wear it!

1494
02:01:13,675 --> 02:01:17,675
Wear it or I'll pump all
the six bullets into you.

1495
02:01:19,633 --> 02:01:22,050
Now run!

1496
02:01:22,425 --> 02:01:25,467
Run!

1497
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:38,008
(Door Closes)

1498
02:01:44,883 --> 02:01:50,008
You are very lucky.
You have got a new lease of life.

1499
02:01:50,383 --> 02:01:53,508
And this happened
only because of you.

1500
02:01:53,883 --> 02:01:56,967
I will never forget this favour.

1501
02:01:57,258 --> 02:02:01,092
I'll be going now.
- Eat something and go.

1502
02:02:01,175 --> 02:02:07,925
No thanks. I wonder what state my
family is in with no news on me.

1503
02:02:08,425 --> 02:02:09,967
I have to reach Bombay
as soon as possible.

1504
02:02:10,133 --> 02:02:12,758
(Train Horn Sounding)

1505
02:02:17,008 --> 02:02:21,008
You look so pleased...

1506
02:02:21,217 --> 02:02:25,717
like as if we were going to Bombay
not for Birju's marriage, but ours.

1507
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:29,300
Then...
You sleep, brother.

1508
02:02:29,967 --> 02:02:34,633
Birju is my only childhood friend.
Won't I be pleased?

1509
02:02:35,133 --> 02:02:37,592
Besides, I'm going to Bombay
for the first time.

1510
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:42,425
That's all right, but the station
is nearing and we are hungry.

1511
02:02:42,508 --> 02:02:44,092
I will go and get something.
- Yes!

1512
02:03:02,008 --> 02:03:02,925
Look!

1513
02:03:03,008 --> 02:03:04,675
How much for a samosa?
- One buck.

1514
02:03:04,842 --> 02:03:06,092
Pack ten of them.

1515
02:03:06,425 --> 02:03:10,342
Look.
- The face is exactly the same.

1516
02:03:10,842 --> 02:03:13,758
But he's not the man.
- This man looks like a village guy.

1517
02:03:13,842 --> 02:03:16,592
He is a village guy.

1518
02:03:16,675 --> 02:03:22,133
We'll only cut his pigtail and
collect the reward of Rs.50,000.

1519
02:03:22,342 --> 02:03:24,633
What do you think?
- It's a great idea.

1520
02:03:24,717 --> 02:03:28,592
Hello! Which village are you from?
- Hello!

1521
02:03:28,675 --> 02:03:32,592
Me? I'm from Handiya.
- That is why you look so handsome.

1522
02:03:32,675 --> 02:03:36,717
You are carrying ten samosas,
that too, each costing five!

1523
02:03:37,383 --> 02:03:39,592
Each cost only one buck.

1524
02:03:39,675 --> 02:03:44,175
You must be joking.
He gives us one for five bucks.

1525
02:03:44,342 --> 02:03:51,550
Oh really?... You do look foolish,
that is why he cheated you.

1526
02:03:51,633 --> 02:03:55,717
Why don't you give
us one for 2:50?

1527
02:03:56,258 --> 02:04:02,925
Sure! That means I'll make
a profit of 1:50 on each samosa.

1528
02:04:03,008 --> 02:04:06,633
Give me all of them and calculate
how much I should pay you.

1529
02:04:06,717 --> 02:04:10,508
2:50 for one,
that makes 5 for two.

1530
02:04:10,592 --> 02:04:12,383
7:50 for three,
and for four, it's...

1531
02:04:12,467 --> 02:04:14,758
(Train Horn Sounding)

1532
02:04:16,842 --> 02:04:20,258
What happened?
- My train has left!

1533
02:04:21,175 --> 02:04:24,925
Someone stop the train!
- Gauri is left behind at the station.

1534
02:04:25,008 --> 02:04:28,050
Do something!
- Gauri!

1535
02:04:29,675 --> 02:04:31,675
Oh Chandramukhi!

1536
02:04:33,633 --> 02:04:35,133
Oh Chandramukhi!

1537
02:04:35,217 --> 02:04:39,508
Why are you crying?
We will take you to Bombay.

1538
02:04:39,675 --> 02:04:44,300
What will I do in Bombay?
I don't even have Birju's address.

1539
02:04:44,508 --> 02:04:48,550
There is an ascetic
here who can help you.

1540
02:04:49,925 --> 02:04:54,300
Don't worry, I will give
you your friend's address.

1541
02:04:54,342 --> 02:04:59,633
Close your eyes for ten minutes
and you'll see your friend's face.

1542
02:04:59,717 --> 02:05:01,800
What say?
- Very nice! Very nice!

1543
02:05:04,467 --> 02:05:07,883
Why are you touching my hair?
- Don't talk.

1544
02:05:07,967 --> 02:05:11,300
If you break your concentration,
you won't find your friend.

1545
02:05:11,342 --> 02:05:12,717
What say?
- All right.

1546
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:14,008
Close your eyes.

1547
02:05:18,592 --> 02:05:23,800
Now open your eyes
and tell me what you see.

1548
02:05:26,133 --> 02:05:30,758
Who is this?
- The younger brother! What say?

1549
02:05:31,675 --> 02:05:33,342
(Laughing)

1550
02:05:33,633 --> 02:05:35,883
You did this to me?

1551
02:05:36,592 --> 02:05:37,842
How about this?

1552
02:05:39,842 --> 02:05:41,133
And this?

1553
02:05:41,217 --> 02:05:44,925
Where are you going?
How did you like it?

1554
02:05:48,217 --> 02:05:49,967
I lost everything in this city.

1555
02:05:50,383 --> 02:05:54,092
My father, my moustache,
my pigtail, everything.

1556
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:59,675
And my... Chandramukhi!

1557
02:06:01,842 --> 02:06:03,800
Chandramukhi!

1558
02:06:05,467 --> 02:06:09,217
Now where do I go, what do I do?
Where do I get Birju's address from?

1559
02:06:09,633 --> 02:06:12,342
Hey, watch out.
- Bunnu! Oh!

1560
02:06:12,383 --> 02:06:13,342
(Laughing)

1561
02:06:13,425 --> 02:06:14,925
Bunnu!

1562
02:06:15,092 --> 02:06:17,633
Who are you?
- Where had you gone, Bunnu?

1563
02:06:17,717 --> 02:06:19,842
I'm not Bunnu. Why are you
forcing yourself on me?

1564
02:06:19,925 --> 02:06:23,633
Stop your pranks! Do you know how
worried your family is about you?

1565
02:06:23,717 --> 02:06:27,842
I am worried. Why should they be?
But how do you know my family?

1566
02:06:27,925 --> 02:06:29,633
He's acting again.

1567
02:06:29,717 --> 02:06:33,800
Look Bunnu...
- Who Bunnu? My name is Gauri Shanker

1568
02:06:34,258 --> 02:06:37,217
I'm looking for my
friend Birju's house.

1569
02:06:37,342 --> 02:06:41,300
Birju's house?
We'll take you there.

1570
02:06:41,633 --> 02:06:44,717
You should've told us that before.
- You know where he lives?

1571
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:46,717
Yes.
- Really?

1572
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:50,300
Yes. Get in the car.
- Birju, I'm coming!

1573
02:06:50,425 --> 02:06:53,925
Who is this Birju?
Why are you'll bothering me?

1574
02:06:54,092 --> 02:06:57,175
I'm telling you since so long,
but you refuse to listen.

1575
02:06:57,258 --> 02:07:01,883
Please make him understand, he is my
fiancé but he refuses to come with us.

1576
02:07:01,967 --> 02:07:07,008
She is your fiancée,
go with her!

1577
02:07:07,092 --> 02:07:09,342
But...
- Go on.

1578
02:07:09,592 --> 02:07:12,800
Go in!
- Be a little soft, lady.

1579
02:07:13,008 --> 02:07:15,425
Have you brought me to my
friend's house or to some jail?

1580
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:22,842
O my my! Such a big house.
Whose house is this?

1581
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:25,925
It is your father's house.
- Oh come on.

1582
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:30,175
My hut in Handiya is no
comparison to this palace.

1583
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:36,050
I think Birju has become a
thief after coming to the city.

1584
02:07:36,925 --> 02:07:39,467
Because such a big house can only
be made with that kind of money.

1585
02:07:40,342 --> 02:07:44,133
Birju! Where are you?
Come here.

1586
02:07:45,175 --> 02:07:46,592
Bunnu!

1587
02:07:48,842 --> 02:07:50,175
You're back, son!

1588
02:07:50,717 --> 02:07:51,758
Father!

1589
02:07:52,092 --> 02:07:57,508
Father, where did you go away?
- What are you doing!

1590
02:07:57,800 --> 02:08:01,175
Do you know how much I've suffered
after being separated from you?

1591
02:08:01,300 --> 02:08:04,425
Sons like you who want to punish
their father should suffer such fate.

1592
02:08:05,133 --> 02:08:08,467
I sometimes feel like
breaking your head. But then...

1593
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:10,925
Now why are you going around me?

1594
02:08:11,175 --> 02:08:15,175
Father, what happened to you
after coming to this city? - What?

1595
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:18,925
Your style of talking, your clothes,
everything about you has changed.

1596
02:08:19,508 --> 02:08:21,717
(Laughing)

1597
02:08:22,092 --> 02:08:25,467
Did someone chop your pigtail off?
Look, even mine was chopped off.

1598
02:08:25,550 --> 02:08:26,925
Who cut it?
- Pigtail...?

1599
02:08:27,008 --> 02:08:29,092
Yes, who cut it?
- What is he talking?

1600
02:08:29,175 --> 02:08:31,633
He has been troubling us
like that all the way here.

1601
02:08:31,842 --> 02:08:35,758
At least he recognised you,
but he refused even to recognise us.

1602
02:08:35,842 --> 02:08:39,342
What nonsense are you talking?
How will I not recognise my father?

1603
02:08:39,383 --> 02:08:43,967
Bunnu...
- Bunnu? Who is this Bunnu, father?

1604
02:08:44,758 --> 02:08:47,258
I'm Bunnu.
- Then why are they troubling me?

1605
02:08:47,342 --> 02:08:49,967
Tell them I'm Gauri Shanker.
- Gauri Shanker?

1606
02:08:50,050 --> 02:08:52,133
Yes.
- Look, Gauri Shanker...

1607
02:08:52,550 --> 02:08:57,758
stop your act or I'll beat you
to pulp. Is that clear?

1608
02:09:01,425 --> 02:09:04,467
Yes it is.
I know now.

1609
02:09:05,508 --> 02:09:09,300
You are not my father.
You are someone else.

1610
02:09:10,467 --> 02:09:12,425
I'm not your father?
- No!

1611
02:09:13,092 --> 02:09:15,383
I am someone else who looks like him?
- Yes!

1612
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:22,175
Did you hear that, mother?
- My dear grandson! My Bunnu!

1613
02:09:22,258 --> 02:09:25,258
I'm not Bunnu,
my name is Gauri Shanker.

1614
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:27,633
Everyone in this house
calls me Bunnu and hugs me.

1615
02:09:27,717 --> 02:09:32,258
Oh yes! I have heard that people in
the city hug you and pick your pocket

1616
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:35,800
Old woman, did you pick
my pocket? Show me your hand.

1617
02:09:35,967 --> 02:09:38,092
How dare you call
your grandma a thief!

1618
02:09:38,508 --> 02:09:42,050
You know it is his
habit to pull pranks.

1619
02:09:42,383 --> 02:09:44,675
Tell us, where were you until now?

1620
02:09:44,758 --> 02:09:47,550
In Handiya.
- What were you doing there, you ass?

1621
02:09:47,633 --> 02:09:50,133
Shut up!
- You keep abusing and beating me.

1622
02:09:50,217 --> 02:09:54,050
You better behave nicely with me.

1623
02:09:54,258 --> 02:09:59,842
I see. Just get my boxing gloves.
I want to behave nicely with him.

1624
02:09:59,925 --> 02:10:03,300
Don't you dare beat him near me.

1625
02:10:03,383 --> 02:10:06,758
Until I don't beat him,
he doesn't behave himself.

1626
02:10:06,842 --> 02:10:12,258
Old man, I thought you were my
father and took your beatings.

1627
02:10:12,550 --> 02:10:19,842
But now if you annoy me,
I will beat you to pulp.

1628
02:10:19,925 --> 02:10:21,300
Really?
- Yes.

1629
02:10:21,383 --> 02:10:23,133
What will you do?
- That.. I..

1630
02:10:23,217 --> 02:10:25,092
You'll beat me?
- Yes.

1631
02:10:32,342 --> 02:10:34,592
You have angered me!

1632
02:10:34,675 --> 02:10:39,175
No, Bunnu.
- Will you stab your father?

1633
02:10:39,258 --> 02:10:42,425
Leave my hand,
let me eat the apple.

1634
02:10:43,758 --> 02:10:49,258
I'm hungry since morning. Moreover,
these women brought me here.

1635
02:10:49,717 --> 02:10:52,342
No one even offered
me a glass of water.

1636
02:10:52,633 --> 02:10:55,967
Then he started beating me,
so I got angry.

1637
02:10:56,508 --> 02:11:03,467
Or can I ever beat a man
who looks like my father?

1638
02:11:03,550 --> 02:11:06,133
Bunnu, you have gone mad.

1639
02:11:06,217 --> 02:11:07,592
(Crying)

1640
02:11:07,967 --> 02:11:12,092
Hasmukh, I think someone has
cast an evil spell on our child.

1641
02:11:12,175 --> 02:11:16,300
He has gone mad,
or maybe he has lost his memory.

1642
02:11:20,342 --> 02:11:21,300
(Phone Ringing)

1643
02:11:22,258 --> 02:11:23,383
(Phone Ringing)

1644
02:11:25,675 --> 02:11:26,300
Hello!

1645
02:11:26,342 --> 02:11:30,342
Sir, this is Jaichand.
We have a problem.

1646
02:11:30,883 --> 02:11:36,342
The boy we had killed is alive.
- What! He's alive?

1647
02:11:36,592 --> 02:11:41,842
Yes, sir. But he has lost his memory.
If you say, we will kill him.

1648
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:47,842
No, until he recovers his memory,
he will not pose a danger to us.

1649
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:52,217
But keep a constant watch on him.
On hearing that Bunnu is alive...

1650
02:11:52,508 --> 02:11:57,633
his brother will surely come to
meet him. Thereafter, kill them both.

1651
02:11:58,550 --> 02:12:01,675
Why are you doing this? Murderers!

1652
02:12:02,883 --> 02:12:08,050
What will you get by killing people?
What are you trying to achieve?

1653
02:12:08,425 --> 02:12:14,675
Since we have brought you here,
you are asking us this question.

1654
02:12:15,383 --> 02:12:20,842
I'll tell you today what we want,
because we will achieve it tomorrow.

1655
02:12:22,092 --> 02:12:26,883
The Natwar Shah you have
kept under tight security...

1656
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:30,967
will be rescued at sharp 11 .

1657
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:36,925
Then, at 11:45, he will
leave the country forever.

1658
02:12:38,467 --> 02:12:40,508
Shocked, aren't you?

1659
02:12:41,592 --> 02:12:45,842
The man who is sitting in
your chair as the CM...

1660
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:48,883
will do this very easily.

1661
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:54,967
And then, you will have to answer
to the citizens of the country...

1662
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:58,300
about what you did with Natwar.
- You rogue!

1663
02:12:58,342 --> 02:12:59,508
Traitor!
- Go in!

1664
02:12:59,592 --> 02:13:00,258
(Door Closes)

1665
02:13:04,050 --> 02:13:06,050
Hello!
- Hello sir!

1666
02:13:06,633 --> 02:13:07,883
Hello!

1667
02:13:08,342 --> 02:13:09,467
Hello!

1668
02:13:12,592 --> 02:13:14,675
Sir, you have been fatally
attacked twice.

1669
02:13:14,925 --> 02:13:17,050
Can you tell us who is
responsible for these attacks?

1670
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:20,258
Terrorism is on the
rise in the country.

1671
02:13:21,008 --> 02:13:24,508
And then you are aware that
I am infamous for my integrity.

1672
02:13:25,633 --> 02:13:29,258
I think a terrorist group is
responsible for these attacks.

1673
02:13:31,633 --> 02:13:36,133
It is also possible that
Natwar Shah is behind this.

1674
02:13:36,383 --> 02:13:43,050
It is possible. But I'm not the one
to compromise out of fear for my life

1675
02:13:43,717 --> 02:13:48,383
The Natwar Shah issue
will be tackled soon.

1676
02:13:52,258 --> 02:13:55,467
Sir, you lost your wife
and son in that attack.

1677
02:13:55,633 --> 02:13:57,842
Can you tell us...
- Please no further question.

1678
02:14:00,175 --> 02:14:01,425
Excuse me, sir!

1679
02:14:01,675 --> 02:14:05,342
We need some loan from the
government for an orphanage.

1680
02:14:05,717 --> 02:14:09,675
If you sign this form,
our task will become easier.

1681
02:14:11,633 --> 02:14:13,550
I had no choice but to come, Sarang.

1682
02:14:13,967 --> 02:14:16,883
I didn't phone because it is
possible that your phone is tapped.

1683
02:14:17,175 --> 02:14:19,092
We have made all the arrangements.

1684
02:14:19,342 --> 02:14:22,550
Tejeshwar has said that you
free Natwar at sharp 11 ...

1685
02:14:22,675 --> 02:14:24,425
and reach the same place.

1686
02:14:24,508 --> 02:14:27,300
If you are also ready
with the arrangements,...

1687
02:14:27,342 --> 02:14:29,592
put your fake
signature on this.

1688
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:49,592
Tell me where my brother is!

1689
02:14:50,092 --> 02:14:52,092
Where's my brother?

1690
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:54,467
Stop!

1691
02:14:57,758 --> 02:14:59,633
No!... Leave me!

1692
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:01,342
(Car Brakes Squeaking)

1693
02:15:03,633 --> 02:15:07,008
Uncle, let me go. That woman...
- I will not hear anything you say.

1694
02:15:07,175 --> 02:15:10,508
Or you will take advantage of my
forgetfulness and escape again.

1695
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:14,008
Take me where you like,
but read this first.

1696
02:15:14,092 --> 02:15:16,633
I will not read anything.
First come to the police station.

1697
02:15:16,717 --> 02:15:20,467
Please read it uncle, please!

1698
02:15:26,467 --> 02:15:31,175
You made all my efforts go waste
or I would know today where Bunnu is.

1699
02:15:31,342 --> 02:15:32,842
Really?
- Yes.

1700
02:15:32,925 --> 02:15:38,217
Don't worry, inspector
Pyare Mohan is with you.

1701
02:15:38,508 --> 02:15:44,467
How many times do I say that
I'm not Bunnu, I'm not your son.

1702
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:48,008
I beg of you, just once
say that you are my son...

1703
02:15:48,092 --> 02:15:51,717
so that the warrant
against Munnu gets cancelled.

1704
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:54,842
No.
- Stop being angry.

1705
02:15:54,925 --> 02:15:58,133
It was a heated moment when your
father said that you are not his son.

1706
02:15:58,217 --> 02:16:01,175
I promise you he will never
throw you out of the house again.

1707
02:16:01,258 --> 02:16:05,467
That is what I want.
Throw me out of the house. - No.

1708
02:16:05,550 --> 02:16:08,758
And ask him to be angry, because
he speaks the truth when he's angry.

1709
02:16:08,842 --> 02:16:12,258
I am not his son!
- I will not take his nonsense!

1710
02:16:12,342 --> 02:16:15,425
I will thrash him!
- You go from here.

1711
02:16:15,508 --> 02:16:19,008
Why will you beat me?
I haven't robbed anything.

1712
02:16:19,092 --> 02:16:22,550
Calm down, don't get annoyed.
- All right, I'm calm now.

1713
02:16:22,633 --> 02:16:23,467
Bunnu!

1714
02:16:24,508 --> 02:16:29,342
Why are you behaving like this? Why
are you punishing us for your father?

1715
02:16:29,425 --> 02:16:32,467
What have we done?
Why are you punishing us?

1716
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:40,342
Do you know how we feel? How we
spent each day since you left?

1717
02:16:40,550 --> 02:16:42,050
Do you realise that?

1718
02:16:42,425 --> 02:16:46,175
You don't care about
anyone's sorrow, anyone's pain.

1719
02:16:46,425 --> 02:16:48,217
You only care about yourself.

1720
02:16:48,717 --> 02:16:52,258
You don't care about
anyone else, do you?

1721
02:16:52,967 --> 02:16:57,342
I care about anyone
who is in trouble...

1722
02:16:57,842 --> 02:17:02,050
but since I am myself in
trouble, how can I help you?

1723
02:17:03,258 --> 02:17:08,842
Please don't cry. If you cry,
even I will start crying.

1724
02:17:09,550 --> 02:17:13,050
Seeing you cry,
I am reminded of Chandramukhi.

1725
02:17:13,925 --> 02:17:19,925
She must be so worried about me.
Chandramukhi!

1726
02:17:21,133 --> 02:17:23,050
Chandramukhi!

1727
02:17:24,175 --> 02:17:26,050
Chandramukhi!

1728
02:17:27,675 --> 02:17:31,758
Eat something.
- I don't want it!

1729
02:17:32,633 --> 02:17:34,758
I won't die if I
remain hungry for two days.

1730
02:17:35,217 --> 02:17:39,717
But if you keep me tied here,
a lot of people will get killed.

1731
02:17:41,717 --> 02:17:45,633
Whether anyone dies or not, but if
you continue to behave like this...

1732
02:17:46,383 --> 02:17:48,633
I will surely die.

1733
02:17:50,175 --> 02:17:52,467
Why are you so angry?

1734
02:17:53,342 --> 02:17:58,342
When I put my dog after you, you
used to run around the whole village.

1735
02:18:00,883 --> 02:18:04,342
Dog...?
- Yes. Try and recollect.

1736
02:18:04,675 --> 02:18:10,633
Once you had fallen through my roof.
A snake had got into your dhoti.

1737
02:18:10,842 --> 02:18:14,342
Remember how you had laughed then?
- A snake had got into my dhoti?

1738
02:18:15,217 --> 02:18:16,967
And I was laughing?

1739
02:18:17,300 --> 02:18:24,050
Look, I beg of you, if I have
done something wrong, forgive me...

1740
02:18:24,967 --> 02:18:27,633
but don't hurt me like that.

1741
02:18:28,633 --> 02:18:32,842
I cannot bear it anymore, Gauri.
How much more do I tolerate?

1742
02:18:33,133 --> 02:18:37,383
It is me who is tied,
who is suffering,...

1743
02:18:37,467 --> 02:18:39,967
and you say how much
should you tolerate?

1744
02:18:41,300 --> 02:18:43,008
Chandramukhi...

1745
02:18:43,467 --> 02:18:46,675
untie my hands
so that I can eat.

1746
02:18:48,258 --> 02:18:50,425
You will eat?
- Yes.

1747
02:18:51,133 --> 02:18:53,425
You won't run away?
- No.

1748
02:18:53,508 --> 02:18:55,425
But first untie my hands.

1749
02:19:02,342 --> 02:19:04,842
Don't bother, I will eat myself.

1750
02:19:07,342 --> 02:19:15,967
Will you stand and stare at me?
Go and get me some water.

1751
02:19:18,383 --> 02:19:20,883
No Gauri, I will not let you go.
- Out of my way!

1752
02:19:22,758 --> 02:19:23,883
Gauri!

1753
02:19:24,342 --> 02:19:28,800
(Music Playing)

1754
02:19:40,550 --> 02:19:44,675
(Singing)
"One wish of my life!"

1755
02:19:51,133 --> 02:19:56,050
"One wish of my life that
I should attain your love!"

1756
02:19:56,300 --> 02:20:01,300
"I should get married to you, even
if I die on the day of my wedding!"

1757
02:20:01,717 --> 02:20:06,883
"I should get married to you, even
if I die on the day of my wedding!"

1758
02:20:12,217 --> 02:20:16,842
"One wish of my life!"

1759
02:20:22,633 --> 02:20:27,383
"One wish of my life that
I should attain your love!"

1760
02:20:27,842 --> 02:20:32,967
"I should get married to you, even
if I die on the day of my wedding!"

1761
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:38,508
"I should get married to you, even
if I die on the day of my wedding!"

1762
02:21:15,592 --> 02:21:18,133
"I don't know you; I do
not recognize you."

1763
02:21:18,217 --> 02:21:20,467
"Then why are you after me?"

1764
02:21:20,758 --> 02:21:25,967
"Thinking that I am crazy
for you, you stick to me."

1765
02:21:31,467 --> 02:21:34,050
"I don't know you; I do
not recognize you."

1766
02:21:34,133 --> 02:21:36,508
"Then why are you after me?"

1767
02:21:36,758 --> 02:21:41,550
"Thinking that I am crazy
for you, you stick to me."

1768
02:21:42,008 --> 02:21:47,383
"You only had told me that I
should not live without you."

1769
02:21:47,467 --> 02:21:52,300
"I will remind you your promise
and your intentions!"

1770
02:21:53,842 --> 02:21:58,967
"I should get married to you, even
if I die on the day of my wedding!"

1771
02:21:59,342 --> 02:22:04,300
"I should get married to you, even
if I die on the day of my wedding!"

1772
02:22:04,592 --> 02:22:09,258
"One wish of my life!"

1773
02:22:15,258 --> 02:22:20,008
"One wish of my life that
I should attain your love!"

1774
02:22:20,342 --> 02:22:25,467
"I should get married to you, even
if I die on the day of my wedding!"

1775
02:22:25,758 --> 02:22:30,925
"I should get married to you, even
if I die on the day of my wedding!"

1776
02:22:55,008 --> 02:22:59,925
"If you break my heart
then I can do this."

1777
02:23:00,342 --> 02:23:05,633
"You will remember me; I can give
up my life on your door step."

1778
02:23:10,925 --> 02:23:15,633
"If you break my heart
then I can do this."

1779
02:23:16,217 --> 02:23:21,467
"You will remember me; I can give
up my life on your door step."

1780
02:23:26,633 --> 02:23:29,300
"I remembered what I had forgotten."

1781
02:23:29,342 --> 02:23:31,883
"I am the same that
you had told me."

1782
02:23:31,967 --> 02:23:34,342
"My Chandramukhi, please
do not be sad."

1783
02:23:34,383 --> 02:23:36,633
"I will never leave
you and go anywhere."

1784
02:23:38,425 --> 02:23:43,550
"I should get married to you, even
if I die on the day of my wedding!"

1785
02:23:43,925 --> 02:23:48,800
"I should get married to you, even
if I die on the day of my wedding!"

1786
02:23:49,133 --> 02:23:53,800
"One wish of my life!"

1787
02:23:59,550 --> 02:24:04,300
"One wish of my life that
I should attain your love!"

1788
02:24:04,758 --> 02:24:09,633
"I should get married to you, even
if I die on the day of my wedding!"

1789
02:24:10,050 --> 02:24:15,300
"I should get married to you, even
if I die on the day of my wedding!"

1790
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:36,633
Uncle, grandma!
Bunnu has recovered his memory!

1791
02:24:40,842 --> 02:24:45,092
Bunnu, my son!
- Daddy!

1792
02:24:45,675 --> 02:24:48,092
Are you all right?
- Just recovered.

1793
02:24:48,175 --> 02:24:50,967
You have recovered?
- Yes.

1794
02:24:51,050 --> 02:24:54,008
How much you troubled your grandma!

1795
02:24:54,300 --> 02:24:57,008
Now please remove this dhoti.
- What are you doing?

1796
02:24:57,258 --> 02:25:00,092
Did Bunnu roam about nude?
- Stop joking.

1797
02:25:00,258 --> 02:25:02,550
Wear your own clothes so that
we can meet the Commissioner...

1798
02:25:02,633 --> 02:25:06,092
and get Munnu out of trouble.
- All right.

1799
02:25:06,300 --> 02:25:09,633
Once I get out of this house,
all problems will be over.

1800
02:25:09,758 --> 02:25:14,425
Those who have put me in
trouble will now be in trouble.

1801
02:25:15,925 --> 02:25:17,342
Tell me, you scoundrel! Tell me!

1802
02:25:20,925 --> 02:25:22,842
What kind of a man is he?

1803
02:25:23,008 --> 02:25:26,758
The skin of my hands has peeled off,
but he refuses to say anything.

1804
02:25:28,258 --> 02:25:31,383
He will talk!
He'll tell us everything.

1805
02:25:32,133 --> 02:25:38,508
You were asking him until now. Now
I will ask him in my police style.

1806
02:25:44,092 --> 02:25:45,383
Munnu!
- Yes!

1807
02:25:45,467 --> 02:25:48,133
Tell me quickly. I have forgotten
what I have to ask you.

1808
02:25:48,217 --> 02:25:51,592
We have to ask him
where the CM is.

1809
02:25:54,008 --> 02:25:58,258
(Crowd Applauding)

1810
02:26:01,133 --> 02:26:02,592
(Car Brakes Squeaking)

1811
02:26:06,008 --> 02:26:07,050
Bunnu!

1812
02:26:07,467 --> 02:26:10,300
Uncle, my brother is alive.
Look!

1813
02:26:10,550 --> 02:26:12,342
Hail lord Bajrangbali!

1814
02:26:12,467 --> 02:26:13,508
Get in!

1815
02:26:14,133 --> 02:26:16,383
Just drive the car!

1816
02:26:16,592 --> 02:26:18,092
Hurry, let's go!

1817
02:26:18,175 --> 02:26:19,300
Bunnu!

1818
02:26:19,717 --> 02:26:20,925
Bunnu!

1819
02:26:22,383 --> 02:26:25,925
Bunnu!

1820
02:26:26,258 --> 02:26:29,258
Come on uncle, hurry!

1821
02:26:29,675 --> 02:26:33,717
Follow that car. Come on, fast!
Hurry up, uncle!

1822
02:26:36,300 --> 02:26:39,300
Faster, uncle.
- Don't worry!

1823
02:26:39,342 --> 02:26:44,758
No one can beat me at driving.
- Hold the steering wheel!

1824
02:26:47,383 --> 02:26:49,758
Turn left.
- I cannot see anything.

1825
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:01,550
Are you blind?

1826
02:27:02,717 --> 02:27:04,883
Bunnu!
- Munnu!

1827
02:27:08,300 --> 02:27:12,967
Munnu, my brother!
How are you?

1828
02:27:13,592 --> 02:27:18,425
Do you know how desperate
I have been to meet you?

1829
02:27:19,008 --> 02:27:22,842
Why are you so perturbed?
- If you are here, who was he?

1830
02:27:23,050 --> 02:27:26,633
Whom are you talking about?
- He was with Hasmukh...

1831
02:27:26,717 --> 02:27:30,300
he looked just like you. I still
cannot believe he was someone else.

1832
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:35,842
That means he was Gauri Shanker.
- Who is he?

1833
02:27:35,925 --> 02:27:39,342
The one because of whom
I am confined here. Where is he?

1834
02:27:39,717 --> 02:27:42,425
They have kidnapped him
assuming him to be you.

1835
02:27:42,592 --> 02:27:44,633
The same people
who attacked the CM.

1836
02:27:44,842 --> 02:27:47,883
The whole family is in their custody.
- What!

1837
02:27:47,967 --> 02:27:51,592
We have found out where
they have hid the CM.

1838
02:27:51,842 --> 02:27:54,217
I think they must have
taken your family there only.

1839
02:27:54,467 --> 02:27:56,842
So what're we waiting for? Let's go!
- Come on.

1840
02:27:57,050 --> 02:28:00,633
Gauri! Where are you
taking my Gauri? Someone stop them!

1841
02:28:00,842 --> 02:28:03,967
Gauri, wait!

1842
02:28:04,300 --> 02:28:08,133
Uncle, Gauri...
- What happened?

1843
02:28:08,217 --> 02:28:09,550
Stop them.
- Who?

1844
02:28:09,633 --> 02:28:12,342
They kidnapped Gauri.

1845
02:29:10,967 --> 02:29:12,800
Why did I kill him?

1846
02:29:23,967 --> 02:29:25,383
The memory lapse again!

1847
02:29:26,175 --> 02:29:27,842
Listen, where am I?

1848
02:29:30,175 --> 02:29:32,633
What happened?
- What are you doing?

1849
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:35,342
We have come to release everybody,
and you are roaming around freely?

1850
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:39,258
Damn! I'd forgotten again.
- You almost killed us!

1851
02:29:58,842 --> 02:30:00,050
(Door Opens)

1852
02:30:03,675 --> 02:30:06,925
Sir, please leave this
place immediately.

1853
02:30:07,383 --> 02:30:11,050
(Fighting Sound)

1854
02:30:56,092 --> 02:30:57,300
Come on, let's go.

1855
02:30:58,217 --> 02:30:59,633
(Door Opens)

1856
02:31:00,550 --> 02:31:05,217
Hello! I'm inspector Pyare Mohan.
I brought them here to release you.

1857
02:31:05,633 --> 02:31:08,425
The scoundrels have
kidnapped our family, sir.

1858
02:31:08,633 --> 02:31:12,008
Don't worry. God willing,
they will come to no harm.

1859
02:31:12,258 --> 02:31:13,633
How fast can you drive a car?

1860
02:31:13,717 --> 02:31:15,092
Car? - Car?
- Munnu!

1861
02:31:15,175 --> 02:31:17,508
(Car Accelerator Sound)

1862
02:31:21,883 --> 02:31:25,050
Faster, Munnu. If my look a like
reaches there...

1863
02:31:25,133 --> 02:31:26,842
he will escape with Natwar Shah.

1864
02:31:31,467 --> 02:31:33,383
(Car Brakes Squeaking)

1865
02:31:43,633 --> 02:31:44,800
Come, sir.

1866
02:31:49,300 --> 02:31:51,675
Officer, Natwar Shah has to
be shifted to Delhi immediately.

1867
02:31:51,758 --> 02:31:54,717
Why, sir?
- Because CBI has information...

1868
02:31:55,008 --> 02:31:58,258
that his life is in danger. That some
of the security here has been bribed.

1869
02:31:59,800 --> 02:32:02,342
Where did Natwar Shah go?

1870
02:32:02,717 --> 02:32:04,717
Where can you take him Mr. Sarang?

1871
02:32:05,383 --> 02:32:07,675
You haven't come to release him,
but to get caught yourself.

1872
02:32:08,175 --> 02:32:09,258
Look there.

1873
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:14,758
(Door Opens)

1874
02:32:23,883 --> 02:32:28,008
Sarang, the law will
punish you for your crimes.

1875
02:32:28,550 --> 02:32:31,217
But for the suffering you
have caused Bunnu and Munnu...

1876
02:32:31,550 --> 02:32:33,425
they will punish you themselves.

1877
02:32:33,883 --> 02:32:35,508
(Fighting Sound)

1878
02:32:52,883 --> 02:32:56,217
Stop them, their family
is in our custody.

1879
02:32:56,300 --> 02:32:58,467
They will be killed,
so better stop them.

1880
02:33:22,967 --> 02:33:27,508
These two have done me great favours.

1881
02:33:28,633 --> 02:33:31,717
I will save their family even if I
have to put my life at stake for it.

1882
02:33:32,550 --> 02:33:35,592
Now I will take Natwar Shah
to your accomplices.

1883
02:33:36,258 --> 02:33:39,050
But they will think I am Sarang.

1884
02:34:11,883 --> 02:34:14,300
Hey, listen!
What's going on here?

1885
02:34:16,300 --> 02:34:19,425
Tejeshwar! Tejeshwar! Tejeshwar!

1886
02:34:20,175 --> 02:34:22,383
Two boys got the CM
released and took him away.

1887
02:34:27,383 --> 02:34:28,050
(Phone Ringing)

1888
02:34:28,217 --> 02:34:28,883
Hello!

1889
02:34:32,133 --> 02:34:34,842
Yes. Let them come.

1890
02:34:38,300 --> 02:34:41,592
Diana, we have a problem.

1891
02:34:42,967 --> 02:34:45,425
It is possible that the
one who is coming is Sarang.

1892
02:34:46,758 --> 02:34:51,633
And it is also possible
that he is the real CM.

1893
02:35:02,425 --> 02:35:05,550

1894

(Door Closes)

1897
02:35:30,383 --> 02:35:32,883
What are you doing, Tejeshwar?

1898
02:35:33,175 --> 02:35:36,717
Don't worry Natwar,
this is an old game of ours.

1899
02:35:37,383 --> 02:35:42,342
Isn't it, Sarang?
- Yes... yes.

1900
02:35:42,425 --> 02:35:43,800
(Laughing)

1901
02:35:43,925 --> 02:35:48,383
You have done a great job,
no one even suspected anything.

1902
02:35:48,550 --> 02:35:49,758
(Laughing)

1903
02:35:49,842 --> 02:35:53,467
Why would anyone suspect?
Don't I look like the real CM?

1904
02:35:53,842 --> 02:35:57,800
Since your plastic surgery,
forget the others...

1905
02:35:57,883 --> 02:36:01,758
even we cannot recognise
whether you are Sarang or the CM.

1906
02:36:01,925 --> 02:36:04,258
(Laughing)

1907
02:36:05,425 --> 02:36:10,342
Since you have become the CM,
you haven't murdered anybody.

1908
02:36:10,717 --> 02:36:13,092
Your hands must be craving for it.
Kill them all.

1909
02:36:16,467 --> 02:36:17,592
No!

1910
02:36:18,383 --> 02:36:19,467
(Laughing)

1911
02:36:23,550 --> 02:36:25,883
You will not be able
to shoot, chief minister!

1912
02:36:27,633 --> 02:36:28,592
(Gun Firing)

1913
02:36:33,925 --> 02:36:34,675

1916
02:37:04,758 --> 02:37:06,758
I've got stuck between these goons.

1918
02:37:18,175 --> 02:37:19,675

(Explosion)

1920
02:38:10,300 --> 02:38:13,175
Sir, Inspector Pyare Mohan
reporting Sir.

1921
02:38:13,258 --> 02:38:14,842
Uncle!

1922
02:38:15,508 --> 02:38:16,258
What happened?

1923
02:38:16,300 --> 02:38:18,258
You forgot again.
- What?

1924
02:38:18,300 --> 02:38:22,758
That the DCP is their man.
- When will I get over this habit?

1925
02:38:23,967 --> 02:38:26,800
(Machine Gun Firing)

1926
02:38:36,383 --> 02:38:38,133
Stop!

1927
02:38:53,300 --> 02:38:56,425
Brother, hurry!
- Coming.

1928
02:39:05,800 --> 02:39:08,717
Brother, hurry!

1929
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:12,258
How long you took.
- Come on captain. Hurry up.

(Airplane Engine Revving)

1931
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:33,925
Stop!

1932
02:39:34,217 --> 02:39:40,675
Don't spare him! Even I have
come here to beat him to pulp.

1933
02:39:57,925 --> 02:39:59,883
Father!
- Gauri!

1935
02:40:04,300 --> 02:40:05,842
Natwar!

1936
02:40:56,175 --> 02:41:00,925
Maybe you've forgotten. I told you
that until you give an account...

1937
02:41:01,008 --> 02:41:05,008
of every penny of the people's money,
I won't even let you die.

1938
02:41:28,092 --> 02:41:32,592
Gauri Shanker!
- Yes, Gauri Shanker.

1939
02:41:34,300 --> 02:41:37,883
You beat me so much.

(Airplane Engine Revving)

1941
02:41:54,883 --> 02:41:58,800
Sorry sir, but however
foolish honesty may be...

1942
02:41:58,925 --> 02:42:01,133
it does earn recognition one day.

1943
02:42:01,342 --> 02:42:05,883
And however smart immorality is,
it has to go behind bars one day.

1944
02:42:06,050 --> 02:42:08,425
Come, sir. Move it!

1945

1946
02:42:13,008 --> 02:42:14,217
Thank you, sir!

1947
02:42:22,300 --> 02:42:23,467
Thank you, sir!

1948
02:42:24,258 --> 02:42:27,342
Mother, my fake coins
have worked wonders.

1949
02:42:27,883 --> 02:42:31,592
They used to buy fake medals.
But today they've earned their medals

1950
02:42:31,675 --> 02:42:34,967
Now you realise? Whose grandsons
are they, after all?

1951
02:42:35,050 --> 02:42:36,300
Yours, Mother.

1952
02:42:36,508 --> 02:42:38,133
Rascals!
- Yes?

1953
02:42:38,508 --> 02:42:42,425
Put in a word for me too,
even I worked hard with you.

1954
02:42:42,592 --> 02:42:45,842
Inspector Pyare Mohan, I heard that.
- Yes sir. Thank you sir.

1955
02:42:46,592 --> 02:42:51,717
You have been promoted
as Commissioner of police.

Congratulations!

Anuradha, I've been dying
to tell you something.

1960
02:43:01,967 --> 02:43:03,633
What do you want to tell?

1961
02:43:04,175 --> 02:43:06,800
Who will be the one
to sacrifice among us?

1962
02:43:07,383 --> 02:43:11,883
(Singing) "Oh the one with
the red veil, tell me your name?"

1963
02:43:14,508 --> 02:43:18,842
"Oh the one with the black dress,
tell me your name!"

1964
02:43:21,967 --> 02:43:25,133
"Tell us your name!
Tell us your name!"

1965
02:43:25,217 --> 02:43:29,758
"Tell us your name!"

1966
02:43:37,837 --> 02:43:41,973
"Oh you crazy for name
tell me what work do you have?"
