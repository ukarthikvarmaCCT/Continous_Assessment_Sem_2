1
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,030
We are leaving from
Delhi to HongKong.

2
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:11,024
And we thought of eating something
in the lounge, we were very hungry.

3
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:12,802
We sat in this lounge,
I didn't like anything,

4
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:14,140
I said let's go to
another lounge.

5
00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:16,085
I went to stylish, I didn't
understand anything there.

6
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:18,769
Now we try Delhi capitals.

7
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:20,516
When we went to the second lounge, I said,

8
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:21,480
let's order something to eat.

9
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:25,141
Meanwhile, I did some check-out, I
was told that Cathay gave me some gifts.

10
00:00:25,262 --> 00:00:27,455
I found this while checking
in, let's see what's in it.

11
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:34,817
I am calling Anish, his
phone is switched off.

12
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:37,528
When I checked out in the
second lounge, it was not fun,

13
00:00:37,553 --> 00:00:39,024
 I thought while leaving.

14
00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:41,598
The previous one was
good, it was useless here.

15
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:43,849
Then I thought, no problem,

16
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:45,935
we are traveling for business
class, we will eat delicious food.

17
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:47,842
As soon as we got on
the plane, we got screwed.

18
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:54,380
Bro, they didn't give us dinner.

19
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:56,701
Because maybe they don't have
late night dinner in HongKong.

20
00:00:57,306 --> 00:00:59,325
They will serve breakfast in the morning.

21
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:02,270
It was night and I was feeling hungry.

22
00:01:05,713 --> 00:01:09,384
We slept, finally I got my
breakfast in the morning.

23
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:11,789
We didn't have dinner, but
as soon as I got my breakfast,

24
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:13,233
It was time to land.

25
00:01:13,717 --> 00:01:15,584
The captain announced,
cabin crew please prepare.

26
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:17,702
Bro, I just put the first
morsel in my mouth,

27
00:01:17,764 --> 00:01:19,305
The cabin crew pulled
the tray from in front of me.

28
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:20,717
Sir, we are about to
land, you can't eat now.

29
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:29,954
Zooming in to see who
is bathing on the beach.

30
00:01:49,024 --> 00:01:50,765
Finally we reached our room.

31
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:53,462
On the way, I was feeling so sleepy.

32
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:56,302
I thought we will see Hong Kong later.

33
00:01:56,796 --> 00:01:57,838
Brother, I slept in the car.

34
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:58,832
Right now we have reached our room.

35
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:03,392
I was so sleepy, as if a drunk person
doesn't know what is happening all around.

36
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,265
I was so sleepy, I came to the room.

37
00:02:05,886 --> 00:02:07,738
Although this view is super awesome.

38
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:09,402
Now I am thinking, this
is it,

39
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,327
This is where I have to sleep.

40
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,744
Should I put a bedsheet here?

41
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:14,480
I mean, I don't like this bedroom.

42
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:15,999
Then I am thinking, from where should I go?

43
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:17,885
I think that is also a
mirror, this is also a mirror.

44
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,518
I thought it is a mirror.

45
00:02:18,994 --> 00:02:20,936
After an hour, I realized
that no, this is the bedroom.

46
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:22,125
So let's do one thing,

47
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,439
 I will sleep now.

48
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:24,968
I will give you a room tour later.

49
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:27,037
It is a very amazing room, but I
will definitely give you a room tour.

50
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:28,522
Look at this brother, awesome.

51
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:31,090
Awesome view, one of the best views.

52
00:02:43,744 --> 00:02:44,490
This is a coffee station.

53
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:46,174
Coffee machine.

54
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:48,581
And here you will get a liquor machine.

55
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:50,905
Here are all the things
to make coffee and tea.

56
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:52,309
Here is a mini bar.

57
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:55,473
This is the workplace, they
have given me a good fruit basket.

58
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:57,176
And the chocolate was amazing.

59
00:02:57,365 --> 00:02:59,260
Look at this, awesome, amazing.

60
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:03,091
They have given me this, a
bottle of alcohol, to drink at night.

61
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:04,532
Brother, look at the view.

62
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:07,421
This is a value for money view.

63
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,287
This is a jogging track.

64
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:11,344
People have been
jogging here since morning.

65
00:03:11,763 --> 00:03:15,438
The sun is not so bright
outside, because they are jogging.

66
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,070
But the view at night here,

67
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:18,818
There is a whole building in front.

68
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:19,499
Okay

69
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:23,053
And here at night, when the
lights will be on, it will be amazing.

70
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:24,922
This is our bedroom.

71
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,801
This is the bedroom, sorry i slept here.

72
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:30,524
Bath area is amazing.

73
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,790
There are two bathrooms and
two washbasins don't know why.

74
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:34,929
This area is so big here you can...

75
00:03:35,286 --> 00:03:37,277
Here are the amenities.

76
00:03:37,557 --> 00:03:38,715
This is a shaving mirror.

77
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,850
You must have read
in the chapter of optics.

78
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,517
This is a concave mirror.

79
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,976
This is a concave lens.

80
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:48,370
Let's go out now.

81
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:50,554
Let's explore the city.

82
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:07,433
I saw two Indians here.

83
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,033
They are not interested in this dog.

84
00:04:09,058 --> 00:04:10,859
Actually they are hitting a girl on thr pretext of dog.

85
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:11,990
I can bet 100%.

86
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:13,369
Is Bruce-Lee is from HongKong?

87
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:15,334
Yes, he is born in Hong Kong.

88
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:19,838
He went to primary school in Hong Kong.

89
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:24,010
We have come to the heart of Hong Kong.

90
00:04:24,037 --> 00:04:24,733
This is old Hong Kong.

91
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:30,013
The guide told us, this
street is full of original shoes.

92
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:30,864
No bargaining.

93
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:31,569
One fixed price.

94
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,233
It feels like we are in China.

95
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:43,738
This is a ladies market.

96
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:45,220
Here fierce bargaining is done.

97
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,833
And original item is not available.

98
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:48,122
This is a whole shoe market.

99
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:49,245
We are going to the shoe market.

100
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:51,040
Finally I bought this shoe .

101
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:53,334
I came here to make a vlog.

102
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,263
But the shoes are very cheap here.

103
00:04:55,288 --> 00:05:00,160
Sneaker fans from India will
empty this store in a minute.

104
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:01,023
I can bet on it.

105
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:03,541
This shoe is for 9000 rupees.

106
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:12,674
After getting free from this market,

107
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:15,209
We went to the most
amazing place in Hong Kong.

108
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:18,294
We took this train which took us
directly to the top of the mountain.

109
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:19,525
And from there

110
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,066
Woooooo

111
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,688
You can see the best view of HongKong city.

112
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:40,244
Enjoy this view.

113
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:42,542
That's it for today's video.

114
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:44,933
See you in the next video.
