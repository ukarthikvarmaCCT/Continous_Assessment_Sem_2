00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,108
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,108 --> 00:00:04,850
World War II is the most devastating war in human history.

3
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:12,476
Numerous large cities were left crumbling after this war.

4
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:17,072
Today, nearly all geopolitical events

5
00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:19,542
and international relations can be traced back

6
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:20,873
to this War.

7
00:00:20,873 --> 00:00:24,270
Friends, I've told you many stories from WWII

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,514
in previous videos.

9
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:28,859
But in this video, come, let's understand WWII in depth.

10
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:29,951
Starting to end.

11
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:31,711
What happened exactly?

12
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:32,757
Why?

13
00:00:32,757 --> 00:00:34,514
And what was its impact?

14
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:36,874
This is the story of World War II.

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,599
"It is difficult to track down

16
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:43,902
one single event

17
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:45,366
that sparked the conflict.

18
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:47,920
For ultimately, it was a series of events

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,220
that conspired together.

20
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,672
To eventually light a flame of war."

21
00:00:51,672 --> 00:00:53,536
"The world's most hated treaty,

22
00:00:53,536 --> 00:00:55,052
the Treaty of Versailles,

23
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:58,201
thus starting World War II in 1939."

24
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:02,052
"The whole world is

25
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:04,766
against Hitler and Hitlerism."

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,831
Let's begin this story in 1919.

27
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:11,281
The year when World War I ended.

28
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,508
And the famous peace treaty was signed

29
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:16,383
known as the Treaty of Versailles.

30
00:01:16,383 --> 00:01:18,505
This treaty contained an important clause,

31
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:19,778
Article 231.

32
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:20,907
Which held that,

33
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:23,224
all the losses caused due to World War I,

34
00:01:23,224 --> 00:01:26,407
Germany was to bear the responsibility for all such losses.

35
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:29,302
This clause is also known as War Guilt Clause,

36
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:30,850
because basically, it was trying to imply

37
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,936
that regardless of the countries participating in the war

38
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:35,319
Germany was to be blamed for it entirely.

39
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,291
France and Britain wanted 

40
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:40,394
Germany to pay heavy costs for losing this war.

41
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:43,606
They wanted to recover their losses from Germany.

42
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:46,354
As a result, according to the Treaty of Versailles,

43
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:51,035
Germany was told to pay a fine of $33 Billion to the other countries.

44
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:54,485
In today's money, it amounts to around $270 Billion.

45
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:57,246
This is such a large amount that you won't believe that

46
00:01:57,246 --> 00:01:59,017
it was only in 2010,

47
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:01,663
Germany made the final payment of this fine.

48
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,511
It took almost 100 years.

49
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:06,022
You'd wonder where this money comes from.

50
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:08,124
Obviously, from Germany.

51
00:02:08,124 --> 00:02:09,148
From its citizens.

52
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:13,532
The first payment of this fine was made by Germany in 1921,

53
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:18,876
right after that, there was hyperinflation in Germany.

54
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,289
Germany's currency back then was the
German Mark,

55
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:27,320
you can't imagine how rapidly it was devalued.

56
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,851
In 1922, in Berlin, a packet of bread cost 160 Marks.

57
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,691
The following year, in 1923,

58
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:37,030
the same packet of bread cost 200 Billion Marks.

59
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,075
Obviously, the economy was crippled.

60
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:41,850
And the rate of unemployment rose rapidly.

61
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,819
In such circumstances, in our story, entered

62
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,380
Adolf Hitler.

63
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,785
A young political leader,

64
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:51,528
who knew how to manipulate the masses with his speeches.

65
00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:54,231
In 1923, Hitler's Nazi Party

66
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:56,528
tried to overthrow the German government.

67
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:57,836
By staging a coup.

68
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:59,974
Even though this attempt failed,

69
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:04,261
this caused Hitler's popularity among the masses to increase manifold.

70
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,016
Rumours were spread among the people

71
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:11,811
that the embarrassment faced by Germany

72
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:14,291
the international humiliation of Germany,

73
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,859
were because of the 'anti-national' elements living in the country.

74
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:19,112
People were distressed.

75
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:20,683
It was easy to manipulate them.

76
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:24,754
Hitler claimed that the Jews and Socialists living in the country,

77
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:26,030
were to be blamed.

78
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,033
They were the reason for Germany's disgrace.

79
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:31,664
Over the next 10 years, propaganda was used in abundance,

80
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:34,778
media organisations were paid,
hate speeches were everywhere.

81
00:03:34,778 --> 00:03:36,842
I won't go into its details

82
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,369
because I talked about these in the video on the rise of Hitler.

83
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:42,308
In case you haven't watched it, I'll add the link in the description below.

84
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:45,719
In 1929 came the Great Depression.

85
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,464
This worsened the already bad unemployment situation,

86
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:52,572
in 1933, 6 million people were unemployed in Germany.

87
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:54,239
Many people were homeless.

88
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,838
Children were starving to death.

89
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:57,877
As a result, in 1933,

90
00:03:57,877 --> 00:04:01,121
Hitler declared himself the Dictator of Germany.

91
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:03,179
After taking over full control of the country,

92
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:06,624
Hitler started working on making his dream of a German Empire come true.

93
00:04:06,624 --> 00:04:08,241
German Reich.

94
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:10,456
A state that would be racially pure.

95
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:13,192
Its residents would be people of the Aryan race only.

96
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:15,941
There would be no space for Jews and Slaviks.

97
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:17,543
To fill people with hatred,

98
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:20,725
they came up with the Judeo Bolshevism conspiracy theory.

99
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:22,382
According to this conspiracy theory,

100
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:24,844
the Russian Revolution in 1917,

101
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:26,755
was supposedly caused by the Jews.

102
00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:29,175
Which eventually led to the formation of the Soviet Union.

103
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:31,874
In 1935, the rest of the world came to know that

104
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:34,100
Germany had an air force.

105
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,129
This might not seem like a big deal to you,

106
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:38,303
after all, every country has its air force.

107
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:41,454
But friends, the Treaty of Versailles laid down the condition

108
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:44,025
that Germany cannot have any form of military power.

109
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:48,033
This was an open violation of the Treaty of Versailles by Hitler.

110
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:50,435
But by this point in time, many people in Britain believed that

111
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:52,607
the contents of the Treaty of Versailles

112
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,412
were very unfair to Germany.

113
00:04:54,412 --> 00:04:56,782
They were asking for such a large ransom,

114
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:58,413
that crippled the country.

115
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:01,342
And the country wasn't even allowed to have military

116
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,594
people consider it to be very demanding.

117
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:06,927
In June 1935, Britain signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.

118
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:09,362
This formally recognised that

119
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:12,358
Hilter had the authority to form his navy.

120
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:14,551
Germany could have an independent navy.

121
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:16,915
But the growing militarisation in Germany

122
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:18,695
alerted France.

123
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:23,781
France built a 450 km long fortification on its Eastern border.

124
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:26,488
This was named the Maginot Line.

125
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:27,999
In 1938,

126
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:31,056
when Hitler believed that his military was sufficiently prepared,

127
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:34,876
he focused his attention on their neighbour Austria.

128
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,440
Austria was a must-have country for Hitler.

129
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,980
He wanted all German-speaking countries

130
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,382
to unite as one nation.

131
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,399
His ultimate goal was not only to

132
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:45,719
conquer as many countries as possible to satisfy his pride,

133
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:48,804
but also to acquire its resources

134
00:05:48,804 --> 00:05:50,359
to advance his own country.

135
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:53,152
The people Hitler believed to be racially superior, 

136
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,845
his Aryan race,

137
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,527
he wanted to give them Lebensraum.

138
00:05:56,527 --> 00:05:57,926
To give them living space.

139
00:05:57,926 --> 00:05:59,781
So that they could live freely.

140
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:04,334
In February 1938, Hitler met Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg,

141
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:07,729
he was forced into signing an agreement.

142
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:10,326
The agreement allowed Hitler to

143
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:13,035
place pro-Nazi people on the Austrian government.

144
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:15,433
The Austrian government was infiltrated

145
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:16,830
by appointing his own people

146
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,942
For example Dr. Hans Fischböck.

147
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:20,896
He was supposed to be the new finance minister of Austria.

148
00:06:20,896 --> 00:06:22,306
He was a Nazi,

149
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:24,709
and the other Nazis who were in jail,

150
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,278
were set free by him.

151
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:29,351
Within a month, things were out of control.

152
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:33,515
Austrian Chancellor knew that if the infiltration was to be stopped

153
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:35,896
the people needed to be consulted first.

154
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,991
Whether Austria should be an independent country

155
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:42,353
or be a united country with the Nazis.

156
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:44,244
He decided to have a national vote for it.

157
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:47,217
As soon as Hitler found out about the national vote,

158
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:51,266
Hitler took his army and marched into Austria.

159
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,635
The German military entered Vienna.

160
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:56,338
But the Austrian Chancellor wanted no bloodshed.

161
00:06:56,338 --> 00:06:58,558
He resigned from his seat.

162
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,897
Hitler used his propaganda ministry to spread fake news.

163
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:04,426
Of riots happening in Vienna.

164
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:07,156
And how the Communists were responsible for the riots.

165
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:10,306
And so the Austrian government asked the German army

166
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:11,788
to help them protect Austria.

167
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:14,812
The next day, the Austrian Parliament was dissolved

168
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:17,998
And Austria ceased to be an independent country.

169
00:07:17,998 --> 00:07:20,680
This invasion was successful without any bloodshed.

170
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,841
A major reason for this was that

171
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:26,440
at this point, many people in Austria were in Hitler's favour.

172
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,122
They were victims of the propaganda.

173
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:32,030
They believed Hitler's invasion would help them.

174
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,573
That Hitler could make their country into a superpower.

175
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:36,314
After taking over Austria,

176
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:38,589
Hitler moved on to the next country.

177
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:39,782
Czechoslovakia.

178
00:07:39,782 --> 00:07:41,856
On Czechoslovakia's border, there was the region

179
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:43,440
Sudetenland.

180
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,804
Of the people living here, around 3 million were Germans.

181
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:50,390
Hitler used that as an excuse to claim

182
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,513
that region as German's,

183
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:54,585
due to the Germans living there.

184
00:07:54,585 --> 00:07:59,059
Here British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain came into the picture.

185
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:01,422
He wanted to avoid a war at all costs.

186
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:04,681
He believed that if Hitler was given what he wanted

187
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:07,508
he would stay calm, and there would be no wars.

188
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:09,844
This is why, in September 1938,

189
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:11,937
the Munich Agreement was signed.

190
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:15,566
"The settlement of the Czechoslovakian problem,

191
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:17,313
which has now been achieved, 

192
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:19,136
is, in my view,

193
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:21,214
only the prelude. 

194
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:22,553
There are larger settlements

195
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:24,880
in which all Europe may find peace."

196
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:27,724
Under this agreement, this region of the Sudetenland,

197
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,088
was to be given to Germany

198
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:32,241
only if Hitler promised that there would be no more wars.

199
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:36,197
Hitler gladly took this piece of Czechoslovakian land,

200
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:38,129
but not even 1 year passed

201
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:39,918
before he violated the Munich Agreement.

202
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:41,514
March 1939,

203
00:08:41,514 --> 00:08:45,273
Hitler took his army to invade the rest of Czechoslovakia.

204
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:47,294
People fought for the first time.

205
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,977
But the German army won easily

206
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:52,188
and the country was split into 2.

207
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:54,909
One part was included in the German territerritory

208
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,842
and the second part was made a Nazi client state.

209
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:01,302
A puppet government was placed

210
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:02,892
under the name of the Slovak Republic.

211
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:06,567
British Prime Minister Chamberlain faced heavy criticism due to this

212
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:10,066
At this point in time, Winston Churchill famously said,

213
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:17,919
Hitler looked for the next country.

214
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,715
Poland.

215
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:21,102
To take control of Poland,

216
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:25,800
in a sly move, Hitler signed a Non-Aggression Pact with the Soviet Union,

217
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,065
in 1939.

218
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:30,263
At first glance, you'd think that Hitler hated

219
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:31,934
the Soviet Union and Communist ideology.

220
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:33,310
So why would he do this?

221
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,072
The only reason for this was

222
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:36,427
to invade Poland.

223
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:38,792
The Soviet Union wanted a part of Poland too.

224
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:42,084
In this situation, the interests of the two nations were aligned.

225
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:43,908
On 1st September 1939,

226
00:09:43,908 --> 00:09:47,544
nearly 1 million German troops started moving towards Poland.

227
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:50,955
They planned on attacking from the North and South simultaneously.

228
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:54,640
Other countries were shocked at this.

229
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,209
The UK and France were at the edge of their patience.

230
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:00,471
If Hitler continued invading one country after the other,

231
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:01,997
the next number could be theirs.

232
00:10:01,997 --> 00:10:03,015
How will the world cope?

233
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:04,850
They couldn't tolerate it any longer.

234
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,846
The UK gave an ultimatum to Hitler.

235
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:09,638
If they went ahead with Poland's invasion,

236
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:11,827
they would declare war against Germany.

237
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:14,486
Hitler ignored the ultimatum.

238
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:17,818
And with this, the UK officially declared

239
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:19,404
a war against Germany.

240
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:21,621
After this, France, Australia, New Zealand,

241
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,434
South Africa, and Canada declared war on Germany too.

242
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:27,822
UK's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain

243
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:30,600
broadcasted this announcement on the radio.

244
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:44,357
But friends, at this point in time,

245
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:47,171
World War II hadn't actually begun.

246
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:50,170
This period is known as the Phony War.

247
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,228
Because there was no real war yet.

248
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:55,780
Though technically, these countries had declared war on Germany,

249
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,615
none of these countries

250
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,936
provided military support to Poland.

251
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:02,708
Poland's army was extremely old-fashioned.

252
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,347
Their army still used horses.

253
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:09,040
They couldn't last against Germany's military strategy.

254
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,038
Neither Britain nor France could save them.

255
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:15,005
Nearly 1.3 million people were mobilised in Poland,

256
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:18,613
but it didn't even take 1 week for the German army to defeat them.

257
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:20,330
On 8th September 1939,

258
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,230
German troops occupied Poland.

259
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,184
Friends, here it's important to mention 

260
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,757
Hitler's revolutionary warfare strategy. 

261
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:29,716
Known as Blitzkrieg.

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,668
Using this, Hitler successfully invaded several countries.

263
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:38,125
This military strategy focused on speed and stealth.

264
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:42,596
They used tanks to invade the countries so quickly

265
00:11:42,596 --> 00:11:44,965
that their opponents didn't have the time to think.

266
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:47,083
And then their air force would join from above.

267
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,673
It was known as Luftwaffe.

268
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:52,074
And the invasion took place at a lightning speed.

269
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:54,602
In German, Blitz means lightning.

270
00:11:54,602 --> 00:11:57,588
Hitler focused on making the wars as small as possible.

271
00:11:57,588 --> 00:12:00,154
A war that could be wrapped up quickly.

272
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:01,327
Within less than a week.

273
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:03,408
To maintain this Blitzkrieg,

274
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:05,583
German soldiers were given drugs.

275
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,054
That's right.

276
00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:09,441
A drug by the name of Pervitin was quite common.

277
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:12,002
Today, we know it as Crystal Meth.

278
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:14,486
"Confidential military communications

279
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:16,415
revealed that the Allies suspected that

280
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:18,362
the Nazis were using something

281
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,733
to supercharge their troops.

282
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:23,236
But they had no idea what it was."

283
00:12:23,236 --> 00:12:25,332
When this drug is taken,

284
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:27,302
it takes away fatigue.

285
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:29,603
One doesn't need sleep.

286
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:31,257
It suppresses hunger and thirst,

287
00:12:31,257 --> 00:12:32,672
reduces pain,

288
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:34,974
and gives a confidence boost to the user.

289
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:38,799
Giving such drugs to soldiers proved enormously advantageous.

290
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,659
Even if it was extremely harmful to their long-term health,

291
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:46,048
in the short term, it was very useful in winning these wars.

292
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:49,033
The defending soldiers would waste their time by sleeping at night,

293
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,719
while the German soldiers could fight day and night

294
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:53,879
and finish the task within 2-3 days.

295
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,648
As we move forward with the story, you'd see

296
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:59,396
how successful the Blitzkrieg military strategy was for Germany.

297
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:00,577
Now, back in Poland,

298
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:02,983
Not only was Poland invaded by Hitler,

299
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:06,094
but the Soviet Union was also invading it from the other side.

300
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:09,859
After it was defeated, it was partitioned into two.

301
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,997
Half of it went to Nazi Germany,

302
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:13,511
And the other half to the Soviets.

303
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:15,302
The logic used by the Soviets was that

304
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:16,803
before the Russian Revolution,

305
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:19,573
the area actually belonged to the Soviets.

306
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:21,260
And so they deserved it.

307
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,653
But from the Soviet's perspective, there was another country

308
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:27,148
which was a part of the Russian Empire before 1917.

309
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:28,625
Finland.

310
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,859
Stalin was worried that Germany would invade Finland.

311
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:34,599
Stalin couldn't really trust Hitler.

312
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:36,814
The worst problem with it would've been that

313
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:39,078
the city of Leningrad, where Stalin resided,

314
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:41,882
was only 50 km from the Finnish border.

315
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:45,229
Had Finland been actually occupied by Nazi Germany,

316
00:13:45,229 --> 00:13:48,003
they would've been too close to Stalin's home.

317
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:52,235
So without waiting for Hitler to try to occupy Finland,

318
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:55,766
the Soviet Union asks Finland to hand over their territory to the Soviets.

319
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:57,433
Obviously, Finland refused.

320
00:13:57,433 --> 00:14:00,893
And so the Soviets launched military action

321
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:03,834
against Finland in November 1939.

322
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:07,103
What was Soviet leader Joseph Stalin thinking exactly?

323
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,183
What were his ideologies?

324
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,908
To understand this better, I'd recommend

325
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:15,005

The link to it is in the description below.

335
00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:43,666
And now, let's get back to the topic.

336
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,466
This was an imbalanced war too.

337
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:50,074
Soviet Union's army was much larger than Finland's.

338
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:51,868
They had better equipment too.

339
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:54,597
But this war lasted for more than 2 months.

340
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:56,811
And the Soviets couldn't gain much.

341
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:59,597
Finally, in March 1940, this battle was over.

342
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:02,582
And the Moscow Peace Treaty was signed.

343
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:06,131
According to this, 11% of Finland's land,

344
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:08,554
would be handed over to the Soviet Union.

345
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:12,242
In the meanwhile, Hitler's focus wasn't actually on Finland.

346
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:14,652
He was looking at Norway and Denmark.

347
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:17,879
In April 1940, Hitler prepared his plans 

348
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:20,868
on how he could establish control over Norway and Denmark.

349
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:22,855
On 9th April 1940,

350
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,411
Hitler used his Blitzkrieg strategy

351
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:28,938
to invade Norway and Denmark.

352
00:15:28,938 --> 00:15:31,057
This invasion didn't last long either.

353
00:15:31,057 --> 00:15:32,439
Both were small countries.

354
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:35,131
How could they compete against the German Army?

355
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:38,935
The Norwegian government fled to London

356
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:42,556
and in London, a Government in Exile was set up.

357
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:46,177
In Norway, Hitler established his puppet pro-Nazi government.

358
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:48,756
British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain

359
00:15:48,756 --> 00:15:50,594
accepted his failure.

360
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:54,355
The failure to protect so many neighbouring countries

361
00:15:54,355 --> 00:15:55,737
from the Nazi invasion.

362
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:58,514
Due to this, on 10th May 1940,

363
00:15:58,514 --> 00:16:01,965
he resigned from the position of Prime Minister.

364
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,068
The seat of the Prime Minister and its responsibilities

365
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:23,968
were handed over to the infamous Winston Churchill.

366
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:25,557
On the same day, 10th May,

367
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:27,255
Hitler launched an attack on

368
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:30,806
France, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg.

369
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:32,827
This was a declaration of an all-out war.

370
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:35,960
Everyone could see that Hitler didn't intend to stop.

371
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,610
At the beginning of the video, I told you

372
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,007
how France had built the Maginot Line because they were worried

373
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:43,119
that Hitler would attack their country.

374
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:45,383
They were building a wall at the border.

375
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:48,727
The French troops lined the wall

376
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:50,125
to protect their country.

377
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,361
"...is the fate of Holland and Belgium,

378
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:53,535
like that of Poland

379
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:54,989
and Czechoslovakia,

380
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:56,054
and Austria

381
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:57,984
will be decided by the victory

382
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,288
of the British Empire."

383
00:16:59,288 --> 00:17:01,572
On the borders of Belgium and Luxembourg

384
00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:04,400
the Allied forces were stationed to protect them.

385
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,170
Hitler used his trademark Blitzkrieg strategy.

386
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,959
More than 1,000 fighter bomber airplanes

387
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,896
around 3 million soldiers on the ground as the offence for Germany,

388
00:17:14,896 --> 00:17:17,694
this was known as the Battle of France.

389
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:20,357
The German troops were divided into 3 groups.

390
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:21,935
A, B, and C.

391
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:25,194
Group B was to attack the Netherlands.

392
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:27,992
And then enter Belgium to fight the Allied forces.

393
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:31,286
Group C was to attack the Maginot Line.

394
00:17:31,286 --> 00:17:33,942
And are you wondering what was Group A supposed to do?

395
00:17:33,942 --> 00:17:36,240
Group A was the master plan.

396
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,541
Group C's attack on Maginot Line

397
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,176
was merely a distraction

398
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:42,988
so that Group A could sneakily execute the master plan.

399
00:17:42,988 --> 00:17:46,316
Entering France through the Ardennes Forest.

400
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,942
This was a vast forest

401
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:52,464
was believed to be a strong fortress
by France's military experts. 

402
00:17:52,464 --> 00:17:54,389
They assumed that the German army would never be able to come through it

403
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:55,801
because it would be too difficult. 

404
00:17:55,801 --> 00:18:00,119
They didn't expect the German army to invade via this forest.

405
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,934
More than 40,000 military vehicles were used.

406
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:05,476
by Group A to enter France through this forest.

407
00:18:05,476 --> 00:18:07,291
On 15th May 1940,

408
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,877
they captured Sedan

409
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:11,211
and started travelling Northwards.

410
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:15,693
The British army fighting Group B in Belgium

411
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:18,448
were shocked to see the suddenness

412
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:21,661
with which the large force attacked them from behind.

413
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:25,737
The soldiers were surrounded by the Nazi army from three sides.

414
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,092
They had only 1 way to escape.

415
00:18:28,092 --> 00:18:29,329
Through the sea.

416
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:31,284
Near the port of Dunkirk.

417
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:34,560
So they planned to escape from there.

418
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,970
What happened in Dunkirk was a historical turn of events in WWII.

419
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:44,160
Nearly 400,000 allied troops were stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk.

420
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,372
When I'm using the term 'Allied'

421
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:48,807
it basically refers to the British and French armies.

422
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:51,195
The countries fighting Hitler

423
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:53,889
their group or their collation is known as the Allies.

424
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:56,484
And the countries fighting in support of Hitler,

425
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:58,138
are known as the Axis Powers.

426
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,932
It was crucial to save the Allied soldiers in time

427
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,344
because the Nazi army was moving towards them at great speeds.

428
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,523
They had no other way of escape.

429
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:08,591
They could evacuate only through the sea.

430
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:12,268
If this couldn't be done in time, 400,000 troops could be killed there.

431
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:14,834
It would've been a huge drawback for Britain and France.

432
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:17,360
They might have lost their countries forever. 

433
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,032
Winston Churchill made a plan to evacuate the soldiers.

434
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:23,052
On 26th May 1940,

435
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:24,913
Operation Dynamo was launched.

436
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:29,043
The biggest evacuation in military history.

437
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,799
On land, the German army had reached the beaches.

438
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,531
They were firing at the troops.

439
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:37,006
The German airforce was attacking from above.

440
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:40,320
Christopher Nolan made the amazing film Dunkirk

441
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,934
which masterfully depicts the events that took place there.

442
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:47,048
This film focuses on 3 areas of evacuation. 

443
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:49,816
First, British Royal Air Force's counter attack.

444
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:53,268
The British ships which were coming to evacuate the Allied soldiers

445
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:55,200
were given cover by the British air force.

446
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,361
To protect the ships.

447
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,662
Second, some private fishing boats in the English Channel

448
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:03,526
and the common civilians joined in to help in the evacuation.

449
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:06,567
And third, the events that took place on Dunkirk's beach.

450
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,910
The soldiers trying to save themselves

451
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,478
and helping each other.

452
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,503
4th June 1940.

453
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:22,991
Nearly 350,000 soldiers were successfully evacuated.

454
00:20:22,991 --> 00:20:24,981
As you would've seen in the film as well.

455
00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:26,765
But the bad news was that

456
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:31,104
most of the military equipment of the Allied forces was used up in this evacuation.

457
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,271
Some days later, on 22nd June 1940,

458
00:20:34,271 --> 00:20:36,834
France surrendered to Hitler.

459
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:39,118
By this point in time, in Italy,

460
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:41,952
was under the rule of Dictator Mussolini.

461
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:44,629
He formed an alliance with Hitler

462
00:20:44,629 --> 00:20:46,308
to wage war against France.

463
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:48,527
The alliance of Italy and Germany

464
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:50,272
was known as the Pact of Steel.

465
00:20:50,272 --> 00:20:54,036
The two countries declared war against France and Britain

466
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:55,304
on 10th June.

467
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:57,790
By July 1940, the situation was that

468
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,612
Hitler had established control over nearly all neighbouring countries.

469
00:21:01,612 --> 00:21:03,621
Austria, Poland, Denmark,

470
00:21:03,621 --> 00:21:05,494
Norway, Belgium,

471
00:21:05,494 --> 00:21:07,311
Luxembourg, the Netherlands,

472
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:08,390
and France.

473
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,276
At this point in time,

474
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:14,817
Hitler's Germany, Britain, and the Soviet Union.

475
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:17,385
Germany and the Soviet Union had a Peace Agreement.

476
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:20,354
So Hitler needn't be wary of the Soviet Union.

477
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:22,968
He believed that the Soviets wouldn't attack Germany.

478
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:26,539
He thought that Britain was the only remaining fighting Germany.

479
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:28,298
You'd be wondering about America's role.

480
00:21:28,298 --> 00:21:31,065
Friends, America wasn't involved in WWII yet.

481
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:33,313
America was standing back

482
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:35,915
because after World War I,

483
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:38,152
America wasn't interested in

484
00:21:38,152 --> 00:21:41,029
interfering with Europe's situation.

485
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:42,607
It was clear that

486
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:44,971
had they stopped fighting at this point in time,

487
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,148
Hitler would've been the clear victor.

488
00:21:47,148 --> 00:21:49,205
Hitler had a major upper hand.

489
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:52,448
So how did the situation take a U-turn?

490
00:21:52,448 --> 00:21:54,651
And Britain could defeat Germany?

491
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:57,568
"We shall fight on the landing grounds,

492
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:01,312
We shall fight in the fields 

493
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:03,361
and in the streets,

494
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,589
We shall fight in the hills,

495
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:09,118
We shall never surrender!!"

496
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:11,972
Friends, let's talk continue this story in the next video,

497
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:14,661
part 2 of the video on World War II.

498
00:22:14,661 --> 00:22:16,180
I know what you're thinking,

499
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,161
this might sound vague to you,

500
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:20,388
that you'd have to wait months for the part 2,

501
00:22:20,388 --> 00:22:21,524
don't worry about that,

502
00:22:21,524 --> 00:22:23,282
I won't torment you with the suspense for too long.

503
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:25,807
Because this time around, both videos were shot together,

504
00:22:25,807 --> 00:22:27,228
and edited together.

505
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:29,207
Till then, you can watch this video,

506
00:22:29,207 --> 00:22:32,673
in which I explained how Hitler used propaganda

507
00:22:32,673 --> 00:22:35,268
to brainwash German citizens.

508
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:37,746
Basically, the way Hitler took over the government and control.

509
00:22:37,746 --> 00:22:40,049
There's an interesting angle to this story

510
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:41,110
involving Albert Einstein.

511
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,349
You can click here to watch it.

512
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:43,930
And I'll see you in the next video.

513
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,180
Thank you very much!
