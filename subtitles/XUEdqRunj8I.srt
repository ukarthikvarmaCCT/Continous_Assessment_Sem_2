1
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,139
Okay, so, one thing is that we haven't done
anything like this till now, right?

2
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:16,670
I mean, we've not gotten together.

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:23,820
The collective influence of everybody on this
table is crazy, right?

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,820
That's absolutely right.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,820
Yeah.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,820
I mean, this kind of influence.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,820
Huh?

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,820
Gaurav bhai?

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,630
I mean, one thing is that we're talking about
the round table, but we haven't got the whole

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,630
round done.

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,630
We haven't got the whole round done.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,630
It's half round.

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,630
Yeah, it's half round.

14
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,630
We kept the camera.

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,870
We needed a place for the camera.

16
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,050
We needed a place for the camera.

17
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,980
So, the thing is that this discussion is very
important,

18
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,940
not just for today, but also for tomorrow.

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,960
What's going to happen tomorrow?

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,210
What is the future of technology?

21
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,030
And obviously, you guys are also here.

22
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,200
We'll talk about the creator life.

23
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
We'll talk about everything.

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,280
So, I just want to putâ€¦ I'll put a bomb
first.

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
Okay?

26
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,350
Why haven't we done this till now?

27
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,910
Like, whatâ€¦
Like, why haven't we gotten together till

28
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,910
now?

29
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,910
And why did it take us so long?

30
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,489
Because people have a perspective, right?

31
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,530
That outsideâ€¦ Is the tech community
not together?

32
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,710
Is it like that?

33
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,710
Or not?

34
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,909
Efforts take a lot of time to gather everyone.

35
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:11,909
Right.

36
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:12,909
That becomes a very difficult part.

37
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:14,380
You guys have sent us such a big invite.

38
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,640
So, how can we not come?

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,570
I can't do that.

40
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,649
No, it's all about taking one initiative.

41
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:23,170
Like, you guys took it.

42
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,770
Soâ€¦ So, I want to chime in here.

43
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,560
So, I want to chime in here.

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,530
So, I want to chime in here.

45
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,870
So, I want to chime in here.

46
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,610
So, I want to chime in here.

47
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,310
So, I want to chime in here.

48
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,000
So, I want to chime in here.

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,619
So, I want to chime in here.

50
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,829
So, I want to chime in here.

51
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:41,850
So, I want to chime in here.

52
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,009
So, we apply for awards at TrakinTech.

53
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:45,829
So even with this much value addition, I didn't
thinkâ€¦ Because we can tell from a normal

54
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:46,829
video that about which phones we liked.

55
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,230
So, we thought what is it that will, you know,
you know, really bring value.

56
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,530
And I think that was the reason he said, nahi,
karna hi

57
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,950
hai, kitna bhi effort jaane do.

58
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,950
And I think Aishat pulled it off.

59
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,390
Nahi, meko controversial answer chahiye tha.

60
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,720
Yeh toh bahut hi diplomatic ho gaya hai.

61
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,340
So I'll give you the controversial answer.

62
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,229
I think yeh bahut hi hum log shuru kar rahe
hain with everybody loves everybody.

63
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:04,380
And you know, yeh bahut accha.

64
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,229
I don't think that's the real answer.

65
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:07,390
I agree with you.

66
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,050
I agree with you.

67
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,050
Effort hai.

68
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,580
Initiative liya kisi ne.

69
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,760
But I also think that there is this thing
in this community that, why is it that we

70
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,040
don't have enough collaborations?

71
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,700
I mean, why is it that in most videos, we're
not doing things together?

72
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,349
It is because this is a overall community
jahaan pe each of us is very cocooned in our

73
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,349
own.

74
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:35,420
Hamara Instagram, hamara YouTube, hamara channel,
our personality, our identity.

75
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,420
There's not enough.

76
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,989
How many times have the three, four of us
collaborated?

77
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:39,989
Batao?

78
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:40,989
Nahi.

79
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:41,989
Zero.

80
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:42,989
Uska reason yeh hai na?

81
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,370
Ki matlab, okay, pehli baat toh locations,
koi Pune waitha hai.

82
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,370
Nahi.

83
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,380
Koi Chile bhi waitha hai.

84
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,069
Bihar wala menlo sab ek saath hote hain.

85
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,069
Kaunsi collaboration?

86
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:53,090
Aap hamishchah camera leke aate toh ho?

87
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,099
Ki aaj aapko karte hain ki...

88
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:56,780
Main toh all-inclusive bhi hai.

89
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,180
But I'm just saying that if push comes to
shove aur hum log ne, if this whole topic

90
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,069
and this roundtable is all about
being very, very honest,

91
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,800
I think I'm not saying that there is any controversy
to it,

92
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,909
but I think hum log sab bahut inclusive hai
within our own little cocoon of what we do,

93
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,900
hum log zyada collaborative nahi hai abhi.

94
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,610
And I think this could be the start of it
all.

95
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,830
Toh reason kya hai?

96
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,830
Kya hai reason?

97
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,260
I want to ask Devinder.

98
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,260
Because he comes from that...

99
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,260
I also agree.

100
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,621
I also agree with Rajiv ki I feel ki tech
community na

101
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:34,110
thodi si, it is a competitive space.

102
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,700
Actually aisa nahi hai ki...

103
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,700
Exactly.

104
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Matlab wo setup hi aisa hai.

105
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,709
Ki jaise agar phone ka review jaata hai, toh
there's like three reviews going at the same

106
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:42,709
time.

107
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:45,860
Toh essentially everybody is competing with
each other.

108
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,160
Everybody will see everyone's videos, right?

109
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,060
Lekin ek baat bolo mujhe dusri industry mein
aisa nahi hota hai.

110
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,080
Every industry is competing.

111
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,769
Hota hai, but I think in the tech community,
specially

112
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,799
India, Asia, right?

113
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,849
Where we basically...

114
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,959
I think hum log ka competition zyada hai.

115
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,280
I think we...

116
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,610
The social media part of it is that we are
more with I have

117
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,340
to be out first,
I have to have the product first.

118
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,819
Hum log ki ego hurt ho jaati hain agar humare
koi product nahi bol raha hai.

119
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,489
Agar hum globally baat karte hain...

120
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:18,609
Haan, haan, hundred percent.

121
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:19,609
Ego hai baat.

122
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:20,609
Hundred percent.

123
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:21,609
I mean, isme na...

124
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:22,609
I think it's possible.

125
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:23,609
I agree with that.

126
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:28,620
Agar Shlok ne ego bola hai, toh at least itna
toh hum agree karte hain ki Shlok ko toh hai.

127
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,620
Haan.

128
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,830
Main kehta hoon mere ko bhi hai.

129
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,080
I am immediately agreeing, you know, everybody
else can be as diplomatic...

130
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,350
Ego doesn't have to be a negative thing.

131
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,350
Yeah, exactly.

132
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,350
There's no negative to it.

133
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,790
For growth, you have to respect yourself and
you have to have ego that actually fuels your

134
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,790
passion.

135
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,790
Jo aage leke jaate hain, isme kya galat hai?

136
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,600
But at the same time, I would also...

137
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,100
I would also add one thing ki I personally
have a huge

138
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,229
amount of respect for everybody sitting here.

139
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:04,500
Kyunki Gaurav has been working so hard and
it has inspired him.

140
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,100
It has inspired me.

141
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,009
And how Arun sir and Rajeev sir have been
helping me,

142
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,789
I think it is very personal for me.

143
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:15,800
And it is a very emotional thing for me.

144
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,970
But also at the same time,
I think, matlab yeh competitive space hai.

145
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,650
And for that, muskil bhi hota hai.

146
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,350
Hum baat karne hai,
India mein aisa kyu nahi ki hai humne aaj

147
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,350
tak.

148
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,520
For that matter, bahar bhi kisne kya kiya
hai?

149
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,940
Agar hum aisa bol rahe hain ki hum sab competitive
hai, toh same goal for...

150
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,080
I think waha pe thoda...

151
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,900
But more or less, same goal for the US guys
yaar.

152
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,120
Nahi, but
I agree with Gaurav.

153
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,220
You know something we don't know Gaurav?

154
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,750
US guys ke baare mein?

155
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,750
I'm just saying.

156
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,639
Toh basically kya hai ki, abhi tak nahi ho
paya, ab ho gaya.

157
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,639
Acha, okay.

158
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,639
Just asking you personally.

159
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,830
Yeh achieve karne mein, kya kisi ko bhi chase
karne mein

160
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,280
aisa laga ki koi off chal raha hai?

161
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
Nahi na?

162
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,910
All you had to do was just one call?

163
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,910
Yes.

164
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:54,910
And just one message?

165
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,930
Surprisingly smooth ha?

166
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,930
Surprisingly smooth.

167
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,570
Simple reason, main aapko batata.

168
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,960
December ke mahine mein humare paas content
nahi hota.

169
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,090
Yeh reality hai.

170
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,349
Sachme hum log struggle karte hain.

171
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,630
Sancheet, iska matlab yeh keh raha hai ki,
agar maine phone karke bola hota,

172
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:16,660
March, April mein, ya phir Diwali ke pehle,
sabse peak season mein, tu nahi aata tha?

173
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,660
Nahi, nahi.

174
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,050
Main toh aata.
100% Gaurav nahi hota.

175
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,190
Gaurav nahi hota.

176
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,380
I think unka matlab scheduling problem hai.

177
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,380
Exactly.

178
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,360
Not a matter of main nahi aata kyunki.

179
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,690
But hum sabki dates collide karte hai.

180
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,460
Aur infact, jab tech ki baat karte hai, aaye
din tech aati

181
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,990
hai, aur seriously hum logon ka peth bhara
hai.

182
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,710
Honestly, content hi kameeth nahi padti nahi
hai, toh thoda aisa lagta hai ki, yeh theek

183
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,730
hai, kamaayi bhi ho rahi hai.

184
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,730
Main honestly bata raho.

185
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,670
Ki mujhe aisa lagta hai ki, ho rahi hai kamaayi?

186
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,840
Nah, merko ho rahi hai.

187
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Main samjha nahi, kamaayi?

188
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,590
What do you mean?

189
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,590
Matlab.

190
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,110
Ajit toh kamaayi karta hai.

191
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,250
I only want them to say something.

192
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,760
Devinder and Tamil.

193
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,710
So, first of all, yeh bahut badi cheez hai
ki, we have achieved something like this,

194
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,130
that all of us can come together and speak
freely.

195
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,479
Toh yeh bahut hi badi cheez hai.

196
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,250
And I appreciate the efforts that you guys
have put in.

197
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,150
Pehle kyun nahi hua?

198
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,060
Iske multiple reasons hai.

199
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,990
It's very evident that the tech community,
all of, like,

200
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,580
I'm not saying ki hum log, but bahut saare
aisa content creators hain that they don't

201
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,380
get along very well.

202
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,479
And that is the reason it creates a tension
between all of us.

203
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,240
Toh wo bhi rahta hai.

204
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,150
Competition, as you said, is another thing.

205
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:32,409
For us, specifically, language is also, thoda
sa barrier ban jata hai ki, hum ek audience

206
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,470
ko address karte hain.

207
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,470
Look at your Hindi, man.

208
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,930
Main toh shock hoye ja rahe hoon.

209
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,240
Main dar gaya hoon, yaar.

210
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
This is fantastic.

211
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,860
Main Rajasthan se hoon, toh Hindi toh...

212
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,040
Au phir toh phir.

213
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,220
Ragh ragh mein hain.

214
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,220
Yeah.

215
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,340
Toh, ab humein yeh bhi lagta hai, kahi baar
jab hum collaborate karne jaate hain, ki humari

216
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,340
audience, bahut

217
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,340
saare audience,
South India se hai.

218
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,660
So, they might not understand if we change
the language all together, or if we try to

219
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,700
collaborate with a different
content creator who's creating similar content,

220
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,889
but in a different language.

221
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:01,020
So, that becomes a barrier sometimes.

222
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,139
Aur aisa nahi hai ki humne collaborate nahi
kiya hai.

223
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,630
We have collaborated multiple times, but this
sort of collaboration hasn't happened.

224
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,820
But this is something big.

225
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,470
Tamil, what about South?

226
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,419
Matlab, and you guys represent,
Shaz and Tamil represent.

227
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:15,419
Hello!

228
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,060
You forgetting your own person?

229
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,820
He's tracking Tamil.

230
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,580
What is this?

231
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,729
What is this, Arun?

232
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:26,729
Okay, Arshad.

233
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:28,500
Office mein baat karte hain, iske baat karte
hain.

234
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,529
Nahi, nahi, mujhe bolo, yeh South India mein,
yaar Tamil tech creators mein, aise hi hain,

235
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:33,539
yaar situation is
different.

236
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,550
Even we collaborated before itself.

237
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,050
I came to your studio,
I collaborated for a video,

238
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,469
Gaurav ke saath ek video kiya tha maine,
Sherlock se mil nahi paya, so unse hi nahi

239
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:42,469
kiya tha maine.

240
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:45,110
Jab, maine try kiya tha, har baar try karta
hua main,

241
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,110
amesha.

242
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,970
No, not you,
I'm saying, generally, jaise hum baat kar

243
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,089
rahe the, humare ecosystem kya ho rahe the,
South India tech peopleâ€¦

244
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:56,101
Nahi, usme yeh hi dikkat hai, because most
of the time, kya hota hai na, sabko beech

245
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:58,030
mein competition hi hai.

246
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,240
Pehli cheez, most of the things happen only
in North India.

247
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,170
Device jab,
South India ko aana hai, vohi mushkil tha

248
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,940
pehli, aap thoda thoda aaja tha.

249
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,940
That is the main fact.

250
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,399
So, getting the deviceâ€¦
Is it only devices or something else beyond

251
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,399
that?

252
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,510
Whatever it is, the recognition, recognition,
only recent past, maybe the last three years,

253
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,550
we used to get lot of recognition, and the
whole India is getting online plug-in.

254
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,850
Scale toâ€¦
Scale now we are getting, but before, if you

255
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,579
come, even now, people think me that
I'm from Chennai.

256
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:28,800
Even if you're not in Chennai, we can do the
content.

257
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
That's how it is.

258
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,910
We are in Pune.

259
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,910
No, no, no.

260
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,950
For South, if I'm from Tamil Nadu,
I'm not from Chennai.

261
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,120
And previously, what used to happen is,

262
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,570
Phone Erna, or C4 Tech, they used to be in
Chennai.

263
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,700
And the devices, jo bhi aa raha hai, sirf
un log ko hi milega.

264
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,950
So,
mere ko kya milega?

265
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,960
Kuch bhi nahi milega.

266
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,450
Us time pe, me Gaurav, jab inne Dubai se video
jab kar raha tha, we can talk, hell lot of

267
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,730
things about technology even without the device.

268
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,510
That's what I got to learn from watching these
videos.

269
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,670
Then I started doing those.

270
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:04,890
That's the biggest thing for me
Again, you have not answered my question

271
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,290
Your enmity, you tell me
Enmity, competitiveness, our Hindi

272
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,390
No, no, I do understand
See, I follow each and everyone

273
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:18,240
Literally everyone, I've subscribed to them
I started my channel looking at your inspiration

274
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,320
and everything
But the problem is that the regional

275
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,579
You need some kind of a difference when you're
doing videos For me, it's like I create some

276
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:31,430
characters like
Different companies as a character

277
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,240
Then, you know, that's how I picked up my
channel But

278
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,709
again, his question is not getting answered
You guys are talking about you Is there better

279
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:42,872
camaraderie between all of you?

280
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:45,680
I don't know what, I can direct you
No, not with all, let me be frank

281
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,630
I'm putting that out there

282
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,519
Not with all, let's just get an answer
Recently, what happened?

283
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,190
I had a conversation with few of the creators
earlier

284
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,300
So with the new kind of creators coming in
And new guys are getting the views and everything

285
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,000
There is a chance
Either you have to collaborate with them

286
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,350
Or you're just be on your own So which one
you have to choose?

287
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,560
So what do you choose?

288
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,899
I just be on my own
So this is what I'm trying to say

289
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,390
That is the main thing The tech community
is first choice,

290
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,920
be on your own
I'm very glad you've done this

291
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,060
Even though you're saying it was very smooth
and everything else

292
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:26,120
I still do believe that the amount of effort
That has put into get this together Hats off,

293
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,670
I don't think
very many of us would have taken this on

294
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,490
It's a very difficult task
Because while people saying yes

295
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,149
Is only one very small part of putting it
all together

296
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:40,510
And I would really really hope that after
this

297
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:46,350
The collaborations and that sort of cocooning
Where we all go into our own little box breaks

298
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,260
So we keep using the word out of the box in
tech Let's also do out of

299
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,260
the box content with each other

300
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,100
Not be
But I'll answer your question which is like

301
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,529
Is there some kind of a clash?

302
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,200
Yes there is
There is

303
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,620
Okay Okay That's done
Now coming to both of you

304
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:09,240
Here also right now you've said that you know
We should work together and going forward

305
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,810
Still that competitiveness is going to be
there

306
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,670
Still there is going to be that
Who gets the first device?

307
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,870
Who gets the first video?

308
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,070
Why didn't I get it?

309
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,010
I saw the video
No matter how much you do

310
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,250
I mean even with everyone
If I didn't get the device and Gaurav got

311
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,399
it
Then I'll call and ask

312
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,170
Why didn't I get the device that Gaurav got?

313
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,260
This is what we
It happens

314
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,260
It happens right?

315
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,260
No it doesn't
That is Shlok

316
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Yes 100%
Okay so I think

317
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,720
If there is competition
If you look at it in a healthy way

318
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,209
Then it should be there

319
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:46,820
And there is nothing wrong with it At the
same time We all know that we all co-exist

320
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,750
Yes It's a fact
And we don't want to hurt anyone

321
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,760
If I have to make a video with Shlok Then
I know for sure

322
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,050
If I say anything
He won't say no

323
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,380
I know
And I think like I said

324
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,630
When he called
When we spoke

325
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,330
Gaurav you are talking about inclusiveness
We are talking about

326
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:09,171
What the point he has brought is Okay now
let me ask you You will see that Shlok got

327
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:10,171
a device
And you didn't get it

328
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:11,171
Call him
We will do it together

329
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:13,139
Listen I'll give you an example
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 or Note 9

330
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:22,680
I forgot the exact device
I think Note 8

331
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,260
In which was the yellow S-Pen of golden color
It was a blue phone with a yellow S-Pen Note

332
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,470
8
Note 8

333
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,070
Note 8
Note 8

334
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:34,430
Samsung launched in New York
Okay I went to New York for Global Impact

335
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,040
I remember two people with me
From YouTube side

336
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,490
I don't know about the other media people
Ranjeet and Bharat

337
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,339
From IGN
We three went

338
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:47,040
Now I was part of the Samsung Global Program
and all So I got the phone with full box and

339
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,459
everything
In New York

340
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:52,890
For the video
Before launch I got the hands-on system

341
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:58,149
And because I was a part of the Samsung Global
Team After that I went to Korea and all that

342
00:13:58,149 --> 00:13:59,980
happened
Ranjeet and Bharat didn't have that access

343
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,000
to the device Now I didn't talk to Bharat
at that time

344
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,620
I was aware
I mean I knew him

345
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,150
But we never talked
I used to talk to Ranjeet

346
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,029
So Ranjeet got the device
And just the device

347
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,990
No box nothing
And that too for a limited duration Just for

348
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,370
1-2 hours
Do whatever you want to do hands-on

349
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,580
I still remember
There was a place here

350
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,070
There is a walk in New York

351
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,430
Which is built on a railway track
Okay okay

352
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,769
Yeah It was just opposite the Samsung office
I still remember the exact same thing I saw

353
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:33,670
Ranjeet's face
And he was like

354
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,850
What should I say now
Just a phone

355
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,680
And I have a box
So basically you wanted to make a video

356
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,230
So what did I do
I told Ranjeet

357
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,019
I said do one thing Who knows that I have
unboxed the same box

358
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:43,940
I said what happens in the box
That's the cable charger

359
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,930
I said I will make a video
You keep the phone

360
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,020
You unbox it again
And I did that

361
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:56,360
Excellent And here we have a very fine example
Nothing phone

362
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,600
Yeah We had a similar thing When I asked for
help Everybody has been ready to help

363
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,130
And this is with everyone And I keep asking
And I didn't get the nothing phone personally

364
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,779
I don't know if it was a challenge
Or I missed it

365
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,500
But I asked Arun for the phone

366
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,790
And he also
I mean

367
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,440
He was getting a loss
In giving the phone

368
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,710
If I am honest
I think

369
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,290
Look Shlok, honestly
Sharing a device today

370
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,569
For that matter
If we talk

371
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:28,779
It's not like
Let's say I only have access

372
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:31,230
Or you only have access
And they will have it

373
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:36,550
If not today, it will happen tomorrow So the
main point is If you say no, let's say

374
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,660
Does not
End the world for that person

375
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,920
You will get the access
Why not put together

376
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,820
I want to ask a question
There is a brand discrimination here Like

377
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,290
Is there a level playing field
For everyone

378
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,600
There are small creators
At what level is that

379
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,410
And here is
At your level you are talking about this

380
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,540
Imagine a smaller level

381
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,220
I am proud to say
This is a very good conversation

382
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,199
Because this is more or less
A congregation of the top creators

383
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:04,480
Top creators
This is a little

384
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,010
Let's bring it down to the reality
No, no, no

385
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,000
We were not there before
When You know, 3-4 years back 5 years back

386
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,140
We were small
At that time Gaurav was big

387
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,740
We did not have it
And we know that situation

388
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,740
But was there a struggle or not
It was a struggle

389
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,740
That's what he is talking about
Is there a level playing field today

390
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,140
We are talking about
There can't be a level playing field

391
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,410
Level playing
Ranjeet Trophy player

392
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,399
Will not get selected in the IPL
He will have to work hard

393
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:44,020
We can do examples of cricket and everything
else There is always going to be

394
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,389
Someone that is going to be
Now moving forward

395
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:48,730
At one time you were not as big You were not
as big

396
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:56,750
There was a struggle period Today a brand
Knowing that it is the biggest creator Has

397
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,170
created a level playing field
For them

398
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,930
But is there a divide
As he said devices are available in North

399
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,579
India Not in South
Are all these things still relevant

400
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,230
I think this is an important one
Because this is going to be watched by all

401
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,120
brands Could we make life a little bit better
for everybody By bringing forward some of

402
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,429
the challenges
In this sense

403
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:20,770
What is a level playing field
Numbers for brands

404
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,829
I am talking from brand perspective
Now there are about 10 YouTubers

405
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,070
Who are more than 5 million subscribers
They should go

406
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:36,950
Now level playing field
Still does not happen that 8 out of 10 people

407
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,000
go Why?

408
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,240
Because brands
Also have their biases towards certain things

409
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,130
It's not even bias
I will say if it's my company

410
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,420
I have this water bottle

411
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:51,429
I will give it to whoever I want
This is what I am also trying to say out here

412
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:54,850
I completely agree
As a brand it is completely their choice

413
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,930
Brand is not out there
To create a level playing field in the content

414
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,910
But why did nothing discriminate
To the South entirely

415
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,750
Very important question to ask
Let's not get too specific

416
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,550
It can't be North-South
But it happens

417
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:17,860
It happens a lot
I think

418
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,039
He made a point also
North India has more access

419
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,110
Delhi has more access
Like you said

420
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,630
Let's not go into a specific incident
But it's not one specific incident

421
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:33,809
I have heard about it many times
There is a stage 1 and a stage 2

422
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,419
For everything to be sent out
And eventually

423
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:41,179
The reality of the business that we are in
Which is content creation

424
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:46,580
Where views matter Who watches your video
matters Are you not interested in the number

425
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,580
of views

426
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,669
When your video goes out after 1 hour After
12 hours You do look at it

427
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:56,390
You don't ignore it
If you are going to get a device

428
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,860
About 2 weeks after
If you are going to send out All their unboxing

429
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,480
and reviews How do you expect everybody else
To get the same number of views I think there

430
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,080
is that
It is understandable But it is a brand prerogative

431
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,860
First access, that is the reason why Because
the one who will post it later

432
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,990
Is not going to get it
Is our space all about first access Let me

433
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,490
be very very clear
It is all about views

434
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:29,919
But sir, first access brings views
I bought the device earlier

435
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,580
I don't even get devices from the company
I buy it from the market

436
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,540
We have done it too
That's what I do

437
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,870
What I like about what he is saying
Is that

438
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,120
Uniqueness There is a uniqueness in the content
That also brings the views

439
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,789
I know many people globally
Who still buy devices

440
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:53,880
And their videos are fantastic
Views can be 5000, 4000, 10,000

441
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,100
But still
The production quality and the interest

442
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,740
Is clearly visible And he is buying the device.

443
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,310
I'll give you my own example.

444
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,559
You must be assuming that I get side devices.

445
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:08,650
I shop for 8-10 lakhs every month just to
buy devices.

446
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,750
And I think we all have it.

447
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,980
We are not talking about shoes and clothes.

448
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm not talking about that.

449
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,420
So this thing, I mean somewhere...

450
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,460
But you bought the iPhone.

451
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,730
Bro, leave this.

452
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:26,250
I don't think anybody will think about that.

453
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,050
I'll give you my example.

454
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,450
Even today, let's say there is a brand which
is not operating in India.

455
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,640
Or if it is, then I don't have access to it.

456
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,610
I'll buy it.

457
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,530
Hoping that one day, we will have connects.

458
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,530
We don't have it today.

459
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,100
And I think all of us have done that stage
before.

460
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,590
But we can't do it for each and every device
that is launching.

461
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,539
That's where the problem comes.

462
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:47,730
It's about the level then.

463
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,380
Today, when I started YouTube.

464
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,690
When all of us started this journey.

465
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,480
We all started at one level.

466
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,900
In the beginning, we talked only about devices.

467
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,039
Then we went to events.

468
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,039
Then we get devices.

469
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,659
So there is always a level 1, 2, 3.

470
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:04,029
I will agree with him completely.

471
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,460
Because even this IBTR for that example.

472
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,580
We have taken this risk.

473
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,190
Because getting all this together, putting
all that effort.

474
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,830
We don't know whether we are going to get
views.

475
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,370
But we have to do it.

476
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,390
You have to take that risk.

477
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,870
Like you said, we can't buy all the devices.

478
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:21,870
No, you have to.

479
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,000
And if it works, good.

480
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,390
If it doesn't, it is a risk.

481
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,010
Same I would say for me also.

482
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,640
Because when I started.

483
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,020
When I was making videos.

484
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,990
Everybody was popular.

485
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,610
I think for 3.5 years.

486
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,030
I made videos without any phone.

487
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,690
And I didn't have money to buy a phone.

488
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,029
So what I used to do was.

489
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:46,370
If a phone launched, I would make a video
without the phone.

490
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,370
That's it.

491
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,370
This phone came out.

492
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,370
These are my opinions.

493
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,370
That's how we started.

494
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,820
At that time, opinion videos were also very
popular.

495
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,980
My first video that went more than 10,000.

496
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,980
Was OnePlus 5.

497
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,909
Where I made an opinion video.

498
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:02,110
And that's how it started.

499
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,330
But that was the first video.

500
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,870
And at that time, it was very popular.

501
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,150
I started from Dubai.

502
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,690
There was no access there.

503
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,760
And I did those.

504
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,100
So you know what.

505
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,970
I want to segue into that.

506
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,270
I want to ask a question.

507
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,740
If a new creator wants to start today.

508
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,140
You can make opinion videos.

509
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,630
If I don't get devices today.

510
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,800
Today is the time where.

511
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,920
Unboxing videos.

512
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,440
Are on their way out.

513
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,990
There is nothing on the box.

514
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,010
You actually take a look at it.

515
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,010
Right.

516
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,820
I think the most boring thing now for an audience.

517
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,820
Is unboxing.

518
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,100
It's boring for us also.

519
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,700
I don't disagree.

520
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,090
Unboxing is fun.

521
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:47,880
Opening the box is very exciting.

522
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,070
Shlok is your unboxing.

523
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:56,070
It is the most exciting thing.

524
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,070
Unboxing today.

525
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,070
Forget about the phone.

526
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,070
If you unbox anything.

527
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,070
It will get you all the eyeballs.

528
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,070
But I am saying.

529
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,230
Unboxing today is the same as it used to be.

530
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,230
We used to do it earlier.

531
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,230
It's exactly the same.

532
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,470
I have seen them do this.

533
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,410
I have seen Arun do this.

534
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,700
The kind of excitement that they bring to
the videos.

535
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,700
Is crazy.

536
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,080
I agree with that.

537
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,840
But I am saying that we are now reaching that
stage.

538
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,440
Where the audience.

539
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,539
May not be sharing the same excitement.

540
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:25,510
I will tell you why.

541
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,850
When I agreed with you.

542
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,030
Unboxing as a process.

543
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,200
Why is unboxing fun?

544
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,730
What Shlok says.

545
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,730
It is.

546
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,110
Every time you open a box.

547
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,450
There is something new.

548
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,740
Something different.

549
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,100
The emotional connect.

550
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,390
That is not important.

551
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,409
The excitement of seeing a new thing.

552
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:49,409
A new phone.

553
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:51,320
A new design.

554
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
Unboxing a car.

555
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
That mystery.

556
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,650
I will give you a great insight.

557
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,650
About all our videos.

558
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,650
I will tell you who watches our unboxing videos.

559
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,760
Let's say you unbox a new iPhone.

560
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
I am someone.

561
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,270
Who wants to buy the iPhone.

562
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,520
And I have ordered it.

563
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,850
It's showing me delivery in 2 days.

564
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,850
For 2 days.

565
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,360
I will watch 5-10 unboxings of iPhones.

566
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,000
I know they are going to be the same.

567
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,200
I have done this.

568
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,390
It's my emotional thing.

569
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,440
I will watch Sanchit's.

570
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,010
I have to buy the Steam Deck OLED.

571
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,549
I have been looking at every single day.

572
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:31,659
When it shows me it's out for delivery.

573
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:33,510
I will still watch those videos.

574
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,620
For that excitement.

575
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,620
Validation.

576
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,179
I will go one step ahead.

577
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:38,770
Once I buy a phone.

578
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,929
Even after that.

579
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:43,720
I am watching on my Vivo.

580
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,510
I am watching on that phone itself.

581
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,419
It's an emotional thing.

582
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:52,940
It's an emotional thing.

583
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,770
I will tell you the part.

584
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:57,010
That I think has changed.

585
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:59,950
When unboxing as a concept came.

586
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,200
At that time.

587
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
For the viewer.

588
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
For us.

589
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,350
For everybody else.

590
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,500
There was a lot of mystery.

591
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,110
And unboxing was magic.

592
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,120
Because no one.

593
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,340
Including you when you got the box.

594
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,540
You didn't know what is going to come out.

595
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,470
The way marketing is today.

596
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,160
With all brands.

597
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,330
How much of it is still a surprise to you.

598
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,230
Almost 90% of the reveal.

599
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,289
Has already happened also for you.

600
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:27,289
And for your audience.

601
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:30,370
Then why are people watching millions of videos.

602
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,100
India has a population.

603
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,679
It won't be exciting for us.

604
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:39,679
100% Initially.

605
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,190
We put a camera over the head.

606
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,299
Opened the box.

607
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:44,299
We evolved.

608
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:45,470
We changed the camera.

609
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,200
We added expression.

610
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,950
Unboxing has evolved to a completely different
level.

611
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,159
Only the smell of the box.

612
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:54,289
And everything else.

613
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:56,080
And then you just close on the fact.

614
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,470
That you are just opening a box.

615
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,429
And you are describing.

616
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:02,970
This is a good box.

617
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,860
It has an emotional feel.

618
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,740
While it is fantastic.

619
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,270
The marketing.

620
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,130
If you look at the brand strategy today.

621
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,600
Their marketing.

622
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,480
That is based on a reveal.

623
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,020
Of 90% of everything.

624
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,809
Because they are trying to make sure.

625
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,830
Let me just finish this.

626
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,310
A brand today.

627
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,470
Is trying to make sure.

628
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,890
That their product.

629
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,190
Is coming after 2 months.

630
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,960
Somebody is not making a purchase decision.

631
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,120
They want you to wait 2 months later.

632
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,529
For their product.

633
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:36,470
And therefore they want to start revealing.

634
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,470
A lot more.

635
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,470
Even for brands.

636
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:43,220
That used to be very secretive about everything.

637
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,220
Today.

638
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,179
Whether it is done conspicuously.

639
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,179
Behind the scene.

640
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:50,179
Under the table.

641
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:51,179
Everything gets revealed.

642
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:52,179
Agreed.

643
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:54,149
In short he is saying.

644
00:26:54,149 --> 00:27:01,210
2 years ago.

645
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,529
It is not that.

646
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:03,560
It is Shlok.

647
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,910
Doing the unboxing.

648
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,910
Shlok speaking.

649
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,910
Arun speaking.

650
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,360
Arun dropping the phone.

651
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,590
Gaurav doing.

652
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,400
There are channels on YouTube.

653
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
They don't say anything.

654
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,510
There is no face.

655
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,360
Getting millions of views.

656
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,210
You have to understand.

657
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,299
It is the only claim.

658
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,870
Dal rice can never be boring.

659
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:31,440
It is a point.

660
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,000
Yesterday we were shooting a product.

661
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,670
And we were taking a lot of shots.

662
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,220
We had to peel off a lot of places.

663
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,670
My team is telling me.

664
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,410
People love to see this shot.

665
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,440
Peel off and all this should happen.

666
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Whether it is significant or not.

667
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,850
Because that attracts a lot of audience.

668
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,720
And the connection.

669
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,950
Which can relate.

670
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,010
That adds a lot of value to the video.

671
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,140
But B-Bomb doesn't do unboxing.

672
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,530
When you are testing a new product.

673
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,650
Peel off.

674
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:04,100
You guys have cracked the Instagram code.

675
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Kitchen appliances.

676
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,100
Teach us.

677
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,100
Like we were talking.

678
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,950
We get a lot of products.

679
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,000
Because we get a lot of products first hand.

680
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,150
You get it or you buy it.

681
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,280
I am coming to that.

682
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,990
The products we cover.

683
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,510
90% of the products are bought by us.

684
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,860
So we are spending a lot of money.

685
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,020
A lot of research that goes behind it.

686
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,220
A lot of your products are from abroad.

687
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,710
Do you guys do that?

688
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,919
Unique items.

689
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,990
There was a Lyric speaker.

690
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,510
I think it was 1.5-2 lakhs.

691
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,220
We had to purchase it.

692
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,970
There was a Nike self-lacing shoes.

693
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,289
That we bought for 55,000.

694
00:28:40,289 --> 00:28:43,289
It takes 1-2 months for them to arrive.

695
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,440
So do you reach out to the companies.

696
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,529
Or you just buy it?

697
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,299
Reach out is a lengthy tedious process.

698
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:50,360
So we buy it.

699
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,460
It's a tedious process.

700
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,460
It's a long process.

701
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,269
It means there is a lot of money behind it.

702
00:28:59,269 --> 00:29:00,560
To buy that.

703
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,840
When he looks at that product.

704
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,529
He knows that when I make a video on it.

705
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:08,909
It will get a lot of views.

706
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:10,460
It's a business.

707
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,840
It's an investment.

708
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,220
Into the future.

709
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,940
The question that you had.

710
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,710
Sorry, carry on.

711
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,850
When we started building Instagram.

712
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,160
We have very clear intentions.

713
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,500
That Instagram is a different platform.

714
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,769
YouTube is a different platform.

715
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:27,799
So we treat them very separately.

716
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,539
Yes, we make content.

717
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:31,539
On both the platforms.

718
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:32,539
Like there is one product.

719
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:34,940
The content will go on both the platforms.

720
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,799
But they will be done in their own separate
ways.

721
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,970
There is no cross-posting.

722
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,870
Sometimes they use two different videos.

723
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,590
Rupesh is for YouTube.

724
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,539
And Akshay is there for Instagram.

725
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:47,100
So the idea is when we started building Instagram.

726
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,340
We made sure that we are going to invest.

727
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,460
This much amount of money.

728
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,280
In building this.

729
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,900
And in that strategy we were clear.

730
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,360
That we will not accept any paid campaign.

731
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,440
So that was our strategy for the first one
and a half years.

732
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:07,340
Jab tak hum 1 million hit nahi karenge, uske
baad, yes, obviously, but abhi bhi agar aap

733
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:12,480
dekhoge, toh frequency bahut kam hai, because
our approach is audience first.

734
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,290
Agar audience ko hum bahut zyada bombard karne
lagenge, paid content se, so they might not

735
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,690
start liking it.

736
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:22,370
So it's always to add value to the audience.

737
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:26,630
So Ishaan, your question, so coming back to
it, this is a great point, your question was

738
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:29,700
very different from where this discussion
went away.

739
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:36,210
Your question was, if a new person, who's
never done this before, is just starting his

740
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:42,029
channel, is unboxing the
video, and my answer was, not for that person.

741
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:45,740
No, he did not ask about unboxing, he said,
he just said

742
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,950
new creator, only you put that unboxing thing.

743
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,260
I'm going round this thing, one tip that you
want to give

744
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,049
to a new creator, starting with
Rajiv.

745
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:58,470
I think I'm going to go with exactly what
he said, because that is really my entire

746
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,179
spirit and philosophy, jo maine

747
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:05,320
pehle din bhi shuru kiya tha, when I started
what was not happening anywhere in the world,

748
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,320
which is a television show on tech, right,
the

749
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:15,080
strategy remains the same, the tip remains
the same, agar aap alag nahi kar sakte, passion

750
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,150
ke saath nahi kar sakte, and you're only going
to follow someone else's success, you are

751
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,820
100% going to be a failure.

752
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,900
Find the passion, and you have to be dramatically
different.

753
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,941
Inhone ek strategy banayi, bahut clear strategy
hai, we'll

754
00:31:29,941 --> 00:31:34,549
buy it, we'll not take paid campaigns, we
have something where we'll do things very

755
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:35,929
very different.

756
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:40,860
They understood the platform that Instagram
is very different from YouTube.

757
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:46,470
Understand what you are doing, do not be a
sheep or a herd, ke uski shlok ki badi achi

758
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,450
unboxing hai, he does this and
he drops the phone, ye ek weighing machine

759
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:54,230
rag dete hain, ke achar iske itne gram hai,
Gaurav does this way of, if

760
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,630
you are going to take
bits and pieces and segments from all the

761
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,600
others and you want to then create your own
personality, you're going to

762
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,330
be a split personality with nothing happening.

763
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:09,580
The strategy cannot be different today, content
will always be king, queen, prince, ace, everything,

764
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,590
it's not going to change, the strategy must
be that.

765
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,590
Gaurav, aapta hai?

766
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,169
Yaar, mujhe lagta hai, internet is a youth
stage, aur sab

767
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:22,131
ke liye audience hai saamne, wo aaj nahi hai,
ho sakte hai ek saal baad aayegi, hum, on

768
00:32:22,131 --> 00:32:26,480
a beginner level to be honest, main bolta
hoon kisi ko bhi, don't invest ek x amount

769
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
ko,

770
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
kyuki wo return
karne ke chakar main dimaag mein rehega na,

771
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,700
ki main ne itna paisa lagaya, main ko chahiye,
chahiye, chahiye, don't do that.

772
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,890
Log camera kharitte hain, team lete hain,
kuch dharwat nahi hai aaj ki date mein, all

773
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,890
you need is your phone.

774
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:36,890
You did it alone for so long.

775
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,059
Mainne shuru ki 100 video apne phone mein
banaya thi, woh front camera se, why front

776
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,580
camera, because rear mein uska preview dikhega
nahi, to selfie se banaya hai main, anyway

777
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,580
chalo.

778
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,460
Aaj ki date mein, you just need to start,
aur platforms

779
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:54,220
like Instagram, YouTube, short video bahut
zyada rewarding hai, and it all, kind of you

780
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,120
know, requires just you being consistent.

781
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,870
Aapko 100 din tak target kar lo, main 100
din tak 100

782
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,029
videos har roz post karunga, usme se 10 video
definitely

783
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:05,750
viral jayenge hi jayenge, and you don't need
anything,

784
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,690
aapko box nahi chahiye, phone nahi chahiye,
kuch nahi chahiye, you just want to talk

785
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,269
to people, just talk about anything, kuch
bhi topic hai,

786
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:14,429
aapko baat karni hai, that's all.

787
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:18,309
You know, this is beautiful, it just ties
up with what I

788
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:24,600
wanted to say, patience, because
I have been the most patient person when it

789
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
comes to channels.

790
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,900
You know, when I started Trakin Tech, first
1 year, we went only from 0 to 3000 subscribers

791
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,140
in 1 year, when I was

792
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,540
posting, me and Prateek were posting 1 video
every day, matlab nearly

793
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:43,210
August 2016 se leke, May end 2017 tak, 10-11
mahine, continuously daal de hai, aur humare

794
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,940
3000 subscribers ho gaye, kabhi bhi ek video
10,000 ke upar nahi gaye, but I knew someday

795
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,130
we are going to crack it, and then 1 video
jo 1 plus 5 ka hai, I still

796
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,900
remember that, wo gaya, and then we just took
off.

797
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,260
So my thing is, unique raho aap, consistent
raho, har roj

798
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,620
video daalna hai, ya hapte mein ek daalna
hai, ya mahine

799
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,740
mein ek daalna hai, jo bhi decide kiya hua
hai, wo karo consistently, and be patient,

800
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,740
results will appear.

801
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,290
I'll give a very fine example, we had started
another

802
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:16,580
shorts channel, Wittipedia naam ka entertainment
pe, you know, we had given them 6 months,

803
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,399
even after me knowing, me being
mujhe pata hai ki itne saare channels hai,

804
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,320
ki nahi hoga,
mein bola 6 mahine hum log karenge, agar nahi

805
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,360
hota hai, toh we are going to dismantle, we
are not going to put much

806
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
effort.

807
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,450
Every day hum daal rahe hain uske upar videos,
6 mahine ke baad, it was what, hardly 2000

808
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:39,940
ya 3000 subscribers ho gaye, we dismantled
the team, 2 mahine chale gaye, because host

809
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,379
wo gaye rahe, liye the bahar se, 2 mahine
ke baad suddenly

810
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:48,100
1 short went, that
in that 15 days, ek short viral jaane ke baad,

811
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,990
we went 400k subscribers, in 400k, 4 lakh
subscribers in 15 days, aur

812
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:55,530
mere paas abhi team nahi hai, toh,
Anson ko wapas bola, nahi wo log chale gaye,

813
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,530
toh main wohi

814
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,530
bol raha hoon, so patience.

815
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:10,000
Look, I feel, I agree saari cheezon ke saath,
I think consistency zaruri hai, I think saari

816
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,109
cheezon hai, but mere khayal se, ek cheez,
jo ek creator ko successful manauti hai, wo

817
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:19,940
hai ki, jo maine ghari hai, merle work ghari
hai,

818
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:24,910
ke bhai, main apni audience
se kabhi jhoot nahi bolta, main jaisa, jo

819
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:29,109
cheezein hain,
hoon, and ya, light aayi hai aur coffee aagayi

820
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:31,790
hai, toh
aapke aachanak se, continuity, continuity,

821
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:35,609
continuity,
there was a power cut, humare bottle ke colour

822
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:39,819
bhi change ho gaye, green to blue, so,
okay, go ahead,

823
00:35:39,819 --> 00:35:44,410
But ek cheez maine notice kari di, ki jab
sab bata rahe

824
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,420
the, kisi ne algorithm ki, tags, title aise
dalna,

825
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,350
thumbnail aise lagana hai, kisi ne koi baat
nahi kari, and

826
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:57,280
I think, I also agree, ki ek doi bande, ek
jo person video banara hai, ek jo person video

827
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,780
dekh raha hai, agar aap us audience se dil
se connect kar sakto, aur usko kuch valuable

828
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:07,010
de sakto, toh aap video chalegi, aaj nahi
toh, kahl nahi toh, parson ek saal lakh sakta,

829
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,540
do saal lakh sakta, kabhi na kabhi toh chalegi,
aur main bhi, starting mein,

830
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,650
mera bhi bhi tha, ki main call-in mein baata
tha, na paise the, kuch bhi nahi tha, mobile

831
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:20,180
se hi maine bhi video banayi thi, jaise hum
sabne start kara tha, and tutorial banara

832
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,160
tha, main toh mobile mein yeh aise karlo,
software mein yeh karlo, thod tej

833
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,850
rahega, aise ek saal banaya, and woh dheere
dheere pehle,

834
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:31,150
10-10-20-20-100-100 views aan lagaye, toh
fir bad gaye, toh mera bahut simple hai ki,

835
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:36,430
agar main kuch audience se dil se connect
karke kuch de paa raha hoon, and main honest

836
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:41,930
hoon, toh grow hoonga,
and maine jitte bhi YouTubers ko dekha, jo

837
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,670
kuch actual acha kar rahe hain, woh apni audience
se bhauti zyada connected hai, toh mere ke

838
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,030
aata hai, woh sabse aad important hai, toh
tu aise kahe raha hai ki, thumbnails aur titles

839
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,869
important
nahi hai, nahi,

840
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:55,160
but woh change hote rahata hai na, woh constant
nahi hai, toh titles are very YouTube specific

841
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,170
thing, why do I feel
like everything, that I agree, it's a very

842
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:03,950
YouTube, content creation, could be Instagram,
but content creation I agree completely, I

843
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,760
was
just saying, it is like saying ki, yaar app

844
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,160
banane ke liye
wali exercise karlo, are khaan acha khao exercise

845
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,650
karlo, apna ban jate hain, kya baat se kuch,
sauce nahi, all

846
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:19,010
right, haan matlab mujhe aise lagta hai ki,
isme ek knowledge dene se better hai,

847
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,690
toh ek raw thought share karta hu, jab bhi
hum audience ki baat karte hain, hum bol jate

848
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,990
hain, woh insaan hi hai,
jaise ki, agar hum ek apne apartment me rahte

849
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:31,380
hain, society ki baat karte hain, toh mujhe
aise lagta hai ki, jo insaan baate achchi

850
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,980
karte
hain na, impact full baate karte hain, ya

851
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:38,660
phir logon ke hit me baate karte hain, woh
hamisha achcha maana jata hai, kisi bhi society

852
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:43,750
me, toh ye thought maine apne aapme built
in kiya, abhi jab recently meri video nahi

853
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,220
chal rahi thi,
jab maine thoda comeback

854
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:50,690
ka socha hai, toh mujhe tha yaar, toh achchi
baatein hoti hain na, woh society mein kabhi

855
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:55,190
khatam nahi hoti, aur society hi hume dekh
rahi hai, toh, aur YouTube pe aap popular

856
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,030
kyun ho gaya, apni baaton ki wajah se, toh
mujhe aise lagta hai ki, maine bohot

857
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:03,730
kaam kiya, apni speech ke upar bhi, pauses
kab lene chahiye, impact kab dalna hota hai,

858
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:07,180
toh jaise ki, society
ka example ek bohot acha rahata hai ki, humein

859
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,160
log hi toh dekh rahe hain, achchi baatein
karoge, 100% log dekhenge, aur agar aapka

860
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,810
kisi cheez
mein passion hai, jaise mera tech mein, mujhe

861
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:17,030
pata hai, kisi bhi time baatein karalo, uski
baatein mein karunga,

862
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:22,500
log sunenge, toh mujhe se lagta hai ki, yeh
bohot basic cheez hai ki, mere hisaap se baatein

863
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,930
achchi karne wale log jo hai, chalte hai.

864
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:25,930
Okay.

865
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,930
Shaz.

866
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,930
You tell no?

867
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,930
No, no, no.

868
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:29,930
You're the creator.

869
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:30,930
Don't be a moderator.

870
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,119
You're not a moderator.

871
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,119
No, no, no.

872
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,119
I'm not.

873
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,119
I'm genuinely not moderating.

874
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,119
None of us are talking till Ishaan doesn't.

875
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,119
Yeh nahi ho raha hai.

876
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,119
I don't have anything to tell people.

877
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:41,040
Because, I'll tell you, mera toh main journalist
tha yaar, tech journalist mein, usse yaha

878
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
main kya hoon?

879
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,150
But I'm going to, I'm going to ask you.

880
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,180
I'll keep quiet too.

881
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,480
Both of us are similar.

882
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,260
So then I'll keep quiet too.

883
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,350
No, no, no.

884
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:54,270
Listen, har ek ka experience and I have a
feeling that you and me have more to contribute

885
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:58,270
to this conversation kyunki hum log do platform
se aarein.

886
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:02,050
So tell me, what do you think is the content
creator that,

887
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,530
jo aapka question tha, answer it.

888
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,829
I mean, ek toh pehle define kar lo apne aapko
ki, content creator banna hai ki, you know,

889
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:08,829
you wanna do.

890
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:13,070
So I think that journalism still has value,
mereko honestly waise lagta hai, wo ek cheez

891
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,070
hai.

892
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,931
Doosra yeh ki, I completely agree with the
whole consistency bit.

893
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:21,220
Because mereko toh, usse, because I've seen
that myself, kyunki main toh abhi, I'm starting

894
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,220
fresh.

895
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,640
Like for example, you know, Arun and I immediately
had a conversation ki, Tamil chalu karna hai,

896
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,700
me bolein, tikka chalu kar dete hain, let's
start it.

897
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,369
And the only thing
was, consistent rao, bas wo hi kiya, aur kuch

898
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,369
nahi.

899
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,369
Acha content kiya, consistent rao, like you
said.

900
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,740
Talk to the people.

901
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:38,670
That's the same, I mean, all of the answers,
just almost, I have nothing new to add but

902
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,670
all of this is helping me in

903
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,400
building what I want to build right now.

904
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Bas utna bolunga.

905
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,030
Wo, maybe will help you also to build what
you want to build.

906
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:52,780
Aishwarya, I want to ask, and this will come
as a surprise but, do you think journalists

907
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,050
nowadays are overrated?

908
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,050
Nahi.

909
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:58,400
No, not, yeah, yeah, of course.

910
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,331
But the best part about journalism is...

911
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,280
Journalists right now is that they have platforms,
multiple platforms.

912
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,750
I feel that in a lot of places it has happened
that they

913
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,480
have also come on YouTube, right?

914
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,720
Whether, whatever beat they are covering now.

915
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,200
Okay, so if you have to say that YouTube creators,
the content creators on YouTube are on top

916
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,569
or the journalists are on top?

917
00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:19,980
There is a reason why I am asking this.

918
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,090
In which perspective are they on top?

919
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,090
What's your perspective?

920
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,740
The perspective to look at is the societal
perspective.

921
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,740
Forget yours.

922
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,560
What is the societal perspective?

923
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,599
It's looking fun, right?

924
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,400
I want to see.

925
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,349
Because you are a journalist, you are a content
creator now.

926
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:39,050
And also, we expect a diplomatic answer.

927
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:43,040
No, I am not going to become a diplomat, not
at all.

928
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,720
See, what is the problem of a journalist?

929
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
He studies from school, right?

930
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,030
Then he is told who, what, how and when to
follow.

931
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:55,550
So maybe in that, they are not connecting
with the people that the content creators

932
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,550
are.

933
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,550
Okay, tell me one thing.

934
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,970
See, I have noticed it.

935
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,860
Why do tech journalists hate YouTubers?

936
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,860
Exactly!

937
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,280
He is the one who made me do it.

938
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,210
And I have got a very cold vibe from these
people.

939
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,349
Whenever I go to an event, they give me such
a cold vibe.

940
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:10,030
I think he is laughing but I don't know why.

941
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,599
Okay, I will tell you.

942
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,680
Let's do one thing, let's finish this flow
first.

943
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,760
Then we will take the next question on this.

944
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,109
Okay, come on.

945
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:23,829
The one thing is that, don't do this for the
money's sake.

946
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:27,980
Everybody wants to start a YouTube channel
because they will get monetized.

947
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,510
That's what they all want to make.

948
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,319
Okay, I want to make some money out of it.

949
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:34,730
No, if you have genuine interest, let it be
tech or

950
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:35,730
whatever.

951
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:40,890
If you think that you can put it out there
in a very, you know, in a different and unique

952
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:41,890
way.

953
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:42,890
And inconsistent.

954
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,220
Then I think it's a good option.

955
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,500
If you are doing just for the money, then
I don't think

956
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
this is...

957
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,770
It's not a job.

958
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,890
But why is it not a job?

959
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:51,890
It shouldn't be one.

960
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:52,890
Because it's not that specific.

961
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,980
But why is it not a job?

962
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,760
Why is it not a career?

963
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,880
Why is it not a profession?

964
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,210
It's not a job.

965
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:03,630
It's a career, it's not a job.

966
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,780
I don't see any difference in those two.

967
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,240
It's a career but not a job.

968
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,089
People are only looking at the monetary thing.

969
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:13,089
They are just forcing them.

970
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:14,290
You should look at the monetary.

971
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:19,160
I am not really understanding the it's a career
not a job.

972
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,630
Don't do it for money.

973
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,820
Money, no matter what you do in life.

974
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,820
It will come, it's a by-product.

975
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,820
That's a given.

976
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,380
What's the problem with those people on YouTube?

977
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,480
Those who think that YouTube gives lots of
money.

978
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,720
And if they do it after thinking about it.

979
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,200
That's what I am saying.

980
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,829
They will always be behind the mind, always
thinking about money.

981
00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:43,190
That's what I am saying.

982
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,839
And at that time, when they realize that they
are not going to make money.

983
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,960
Then they will be demotivated.

984
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,780
And they will lose track.

985
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,790
They should know that if you invest 2-3 years
in it.

986
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,790
There is a high chance that you will be successful.

987
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:54,790
And money will follow.

988
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,380
But if you think that he has earned this money.

989
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,790
And I will also earn it.

990
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:58,920
I will do it.

991
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,270
There is no such formula.

992
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:03,810
That's what I wanted to convey.

993
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:05,380
But that's for every business.

994
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,820
Every job, every profession.

995
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,890
There is nothing different that we are saying.

996
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,520
In YouTube, the journey is not linear.

997
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,280
In content creation, it's always exponential.

998
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,640
Arun said that he has 3,000 subscribers in
11 months.

999
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,281
That was the path.

1000
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:21,580
And then...

1001
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,510
I just want to say something out here.

1002
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,930
Hold on to this exponential point.

1003
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:28,940
Because I am going to ask a question on this.

1004
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,089
Correct.

1005
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:31,550
Most of it is already covered.

1006
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,630
But two things that matter the most.

1007
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,059
Obviously, you have to be consistent.

1008
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:39,000
And if someone is going to start today.

1009
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,349
I think short videos is the way to go.

1010
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:44,180
That gives you an entry barrier.

1011
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,280
Platforms reward.

1012
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,280
Obviously.

1013
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,070
On YouTube, you just have to play with the
algorithm.

1014
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,339
You have to be consistent.

1015
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:53,089
You have to follow a schedule.

1016
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,800
That you always have to follow.

1017
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,200
And on Instagram, you have to make content
that is share worthy.

1018
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
That works.

1019
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,530
And second thing is, you have to pick a niche.

1020
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,050
That comes to you naturally.

1021
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,270
Because all of us sitting here.

1022
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,270
We didn't choose tech.

1023
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:06,270
Because tech is the most lucrative.

1024
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,970
We chose it because we are desperate.

1025
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,089
We chose it because we are definitely interested
in it.

1026
00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:13,140
Naturally, it came with us.

1027
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,980
Because of this, I think these are the two
points.

1028
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,210
If you fake it, it will show.

1029
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,640
You have to have real passion for it.

1030
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,900
There was a question that was asked at one
another.

1031
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,940
Can you fake it till you make it?

1032
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,859
Not in the current content creation.

1033
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:27,859
It shows.

1034
00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:30,079
People are too smart here.

1035
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,920
Not in any aspect.

1036
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,920
Any aspect.

1037
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,920
One tip.

1038
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,079
Almost all the points are covered.

1039
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,000
Second point is, don't think.

1040
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,620
Just act.

1041
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,970
Most of the time, we just keep on thinking.

1042
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,010
Whenever we.

1043
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:48,610
Stop this video now.

1044
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,470
That's what usually happens.

1045
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:52,790
We overthink a lot.

1046
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:53,790
Sometimes.

1047
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:56,550
Because we see a lot of creators doing wonderful
jobs.

1048
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,869
Covering most of the things which we dream
of.

1049
00:44:58,869 --> 00:44:59,869
Then we suddenly go.

1050
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:00,869
We don't have anything.

1051
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:01,869
What do we do?

1052
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,320
Then we plan for something.

1053
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,330
Then suddenly we see the same thing.

1054
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,470
Which was done by some other people.

1055
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,849
It's not about doing the thing today or tomorrow.

1056
00:45:10,849 --> 00:45:12,559
It's about just act.

1057
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:13,730
Alright.

1058
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:16,780
We have answered all the questions.

1059
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,349
On the topic of exponential growth.

1060
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,790
I want to pick that point.

1061
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:22,910
Do you consider yourself.

1062
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,690
Are you a celebrity?

1063
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,690
No.

1064
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:30,400
Let me put it in a nicer way.

1065
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,370
How do you feel when some fan comes.

1066
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:33,970
Comes and talks to you.

1067
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,809
Takes pictures with you.

1068
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:38,520
What is the difference between your.

1069
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,970
Stardom and a celebrity stardom.

1070
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:40,970
That an actor or an actress has.

1071
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:41,970
Like a Bollywood actor or actress has.

1072
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:42,970
It's more of a brotherly connection.

1073
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:43,970
What happens in a celebrity.

1074
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:44,970
If there's a movie star.

1075
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:45,970
It's always a one way communication.

1076
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,950
The person will go, watch the movie.

1077
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:48,950
And come back.

1078
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:49,950
He's commenting.

1079
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:50,950
But he can't hear anything from the front.

1080
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:51,950
It's always one way.

1081
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:52,950
The content creators.

1082
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:53,950
And their followers.

1083
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:54,950
It's always a two way communication.

1084
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:55,950
Because we address them.

1085
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:56,950
It's somewhere happening.

1086
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:57,950
A two way communication.

1087
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:58,950
Second thing.

1088
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:59,950
The relatable vibe.

1089
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:00,950
He's like us.

1090
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:01,950
He did this and that.

1091
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:06,680
And now he makes videos.

1092
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,559
The way people approach us.

1093
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:09,829
It's very comfortable.

1094
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:11,510
He won't get stuck.

1095
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:23,520
He'll come and talk to us.

1096
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,059
It's very simple.

1097
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:27,760
It's very friendly.

1098
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,470
You're absolutely right.

1099
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:34,040
You know what happens.

1100
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:41,579
I'll tell you the reason.

1101
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:43,349
Everyday they're watching us.

1102
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:44,569
We watch the news.

1103
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:45,569
Regularly.

1104
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:46,569
What happens with movie stars.

1105
00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:48,580
They watch one or two movies a year.

1106
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,380
It's very indifferent.

1107
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:56,980
But when they meet.

1108
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,980
And they literally faint.

1109
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,160
The die hard fans.

1110
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
These people.

1111
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,020
Tell us about the die hard fans.

1112
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,280
Best fan interaction.

1113
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,599
This is a long time back.

1114
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,670
One and a half year back.

1115
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,520
One guy literally came on the road.

1116
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,520
In one instance.

1117
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,390
He fell down from the bus.

1118
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:19,180
Because he had to walk.

1119
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,180
And second.

1120
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,180
One guy fainted.

1121
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,720
I was on the bike.

1122
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,790
And then he was like.

1123
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:27,960
And then he fainted.

1124
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,980
For just a minute.

1125
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,500
Day before yesterday.

1126
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,079
They could not even type the number on the
phone.

1127
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,490
Phone doesn't unlock.

1128
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,900
Camera doesn't open.

1129
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,290
I'll tell you one with me.

1130
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:42,270
Which I thought was an incredible incident.

1131
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:45,290
In a public bathroom.

1132
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:46,720
I am there.

1133
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,060
That person is there.

1134
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:53,060
We are in the act.

1135
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,060
We are both.

1136
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,720
He is in the public bathroom.

1137
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,720
He turns around.

1138
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,720
He sees me.

1139
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,310
He just went completely nuts.

1140
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,660
He took the selfie then.

1141
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,670
Thank God at the right angle.

1142
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:07,109
If it was a typical selfie angle.

1143
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:10,690
That would have been a problem.

1144
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,690
I thought.

1145
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,829
He saw Rajeev.

1146
00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:15,270
And he turned towards Rajeev.

1147
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:16,270
Shaz you wanted to say something.

1148
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,270
Like I said.

1149
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,300
The celebrity thing.

1150
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,480
They come and say.

1151
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,240
My phone is broken.

1152
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,240
What can I do?

1153
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,260
Go to a service center.

1154
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,260
I think.

1155
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:34,530
This is a very interesting point.

1156
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:35,750
That we connect.

1157
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,440
We are not on top of a mantle.

1158
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,640
We are not on a big platform.

1159
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,319
It is not like that.

1160
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,319
It isn't like that.

1161
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:45,220
It is a good connection.

1162
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,390
I think most of the times.

1163
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,960
Besides a selfie or a conversation.

1164
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,590
I think most of the time.

1165
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,430
We are also asked for advice.

1166
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,910
Which phone, which TV, which laptop.

1167
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,750
That's become part of our lives.

1168
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,460
And that is because what Arun said.

1169
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,790
We are there every day.

1170
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,240
Telling them the same things.

1171
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,210
They just come to us.

1172
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,130
And that video will continue with them.

1173
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,490
I think celebrities.

1174
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:07,720
If I were to look at it.

1175
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,730
From an audience standpoint.

1176
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:09,730
I think celebrities.

1177
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:10,730
Have a higher status.

1178
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,119
Their job is to build perception.

1179
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,119
For example.

1180
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,530
I went to watch a cricket match.

1181
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:15,880
I bought an expensive ticket.

1182
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,960
But I was thinking.

1183
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,960
How many celebrities.

1184
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,160
Can buy a ticket.

1185
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,000
But they can't come to a normal stand.

1186
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,599
Because they have to build a perception.

1187
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,800
That yes, we are on top.

1188
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,630
I think it is important to build.

1189
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:28,630
Because.

1190
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:29,630
To watch
A person

1191
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,630
To watch
You have

1192
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:31,630
You have
You have

1193
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,630
You have
Then you

1194
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:33,630
Once a year.

1195
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:37,190
So I think the perception. ...is that it's
inaccessible for a celebrity.

1196
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:38,190
So, the scarcity there...

1197
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:39,190
...increases the perception and aspiration.

1198
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:41,329
I think the exclusivity makes them the celebrity.

1199
00:49:41,329 --> 00:49:42,329
Exactly.

1200
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:43,329
It's the status.

1201
00:49:43,329 --> 00:49:44,329
Celebrity, obviously, they are higher but...

1202
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:45,329
...I was talking about...

1203
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:46,329
Not necessarily higher, to be honest.

1204
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:47,329
Content creators are failing big celebrities...

1205
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:48,329
...on your date.

1206
00:49:48,329 --> 00:49:49,329
That's very obvious.

1207
00:49:49,329 --> 00:49:50,329
our video.

1208
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:51,329
has to open YouTube.

1209
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:52,329
a celebrity.

1210
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:53,329
to buy a ticket.

1211
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:54,329
to drive.

1212
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:55,329
to come to a hall.

1213
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:56,329
to sit in a crowd.

1214
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:57,329
become their dad.

1215
00:49:57,329 --> 00:49:58,329
I won't take names, but I've had experiences...

1216
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,329
...where I've overshadowed people.

1217
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,329
Nearly.

1218
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:01,329
It's a reality.

1219
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:02,329
I'm not kidding.

1220
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:03,329
Who made celebrities?

1221
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:04,329
And then people.

1222
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:05,329
Who is making us?

1223
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:06,329
And then people.

1224
00:50:06,329 --> 00:50:07,329
You talk about Bollywood, politicians...

1225
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:08,329
...people who are famous...
...in multiple ways...

1226
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:09,329
...as long as you are...

1227
00:50:09,329 --> 00:50:10,329
...top of the hill.

1228
00:50:10,329 --> 00:50:11,329
In any field...

1229
00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:12,329
...it's a similar experience.

1230
00:50:12,329 --> 00:50:13,329
I'll tell you a small story.

1231
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:14,329
Like everyone was saying...

1232
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:15,329
...celebrities are not approachable.

1233
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:16,329
They are YouTubers, everyone agrees.

1234
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:17,960
I'll tell you a place.

1235
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,150
DC Chowk in Rohini.

1236
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,400
My car is parked there.

1237
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,790
And so many approachable people understand
us... ...obviously, because we all share a

1238
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:25,790
brotherly vibe.

1239
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,150
He came in the car.

1240
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,340
He came in the car.

1241
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,340
You are Sanchit.

1242
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,720
When he wanted to meet me, he showed his hand.

1243
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,820
I won't tell you the car's experience.

1244
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,250
He gave me a good enough...

1245
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,450
...five to six second pose.

1246
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,770
And I was like this at that time.

1247
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,360
What should I do?

1248
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,970
And then he didn't take a selfie.

1249
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:43,369
He didn't take any selfie.

1250
00:50:43,369 --> 00:50:46,069
He just called me white for a long time.

1251
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:47,520
And that's it.

1252
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,520
And then...

1253
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,940
I'll tell you.

1254
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,990
I was like, okay.

1255
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,069
Listen to my car experience.

1256
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:53,069
It's about Dubai.

1257
00:50:53,069 --> 00:50:54,069
And...

1258
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:55,069
Deepak.

1259
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:56,069
The three of us went out for tea at night.

1260
00:50:56,069 --> 00:50:57,069
I'm driving.

1261
00:50:57,069 --> 00:50:58,069
Porsche Panamera.

1262
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:59,069
Carry is sitting on the side.

1263
00:50:59,069 --> 00:51:00,869
We went to a place in Dubai.

1264
00:51:00,869 --> 00:51:01,869
It's called Disco Chai.

1265
00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:02,869
It's an official name.

1266
00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:03,869
We went there and had tea.

1267
00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:05,780
The person who was serving us...
...was from Bangladesh.

1268
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,119
He was 22-23 years old.

1269
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:08,750
He was a subscriber.

1270
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:12,349
He took a selfie with me.

1271
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:13,640
Then he saw Carry.

1272
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,640
He left.

1273
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,640
Then he came back.

1274
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,640
Can we take a selfie in front of a car?

1275
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,640
We said, okay.

1276
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,640
Carry and I were standing in the middle.

1277
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,920
He took a selfie.

1278
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,220
We started drinking tea.

1279
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,530
He was standing there.

1280
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,620
He said, can we take a selfie inside the car?

1281
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,860
I said, okay.

1282
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:31,580
He wanted a selfie in my car.

1283
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,849
He sat in the car.

1284
00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:34,150
Finally, he got a photo.

1285
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:36,670
He was sitting in the back.

1286
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:39,180
I was in the driving seat.

1287
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,180
Carry was sitting next to me.

1288
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,180
We're back.

1289
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,180
That's good.

1290
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,180
Gaurav, tell us something.

1291
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,180
Back after 10-15 minutes.

1292
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,180
He said, can I sit in the back?

1293
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,329
You two can sit in the front.

1294
00:51:47,329 --> 00:51:52,270
Then he said, Gaurav sir, can you take a photo?

1295
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:53,270
He gave me his phone.

1296
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,380
He said, he'll never get a selfie like that.

1297
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,670
There's a car.

1298
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,350
I'm in the driving seat.

1299
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,400
I took a selfie.

1300
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,099
He's sitting behind us.

1301
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:02,790
This is inside a Porsche.

1302
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:03,790
We left.

1303
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:04,790
We discussed.

1304
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:08,190
I said, if he didn't ask, he wouldn't have
got a photo with us.

1305
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,099
He wouldn't have got a photo in the car.

1306
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:11,750
He wouldn't have got a selfie.

1307
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,839
Why did he ask?

1308
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:14,609
Because he had that comfort.

1309
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:17,390
Otherwise, he wouldn't have got a photo.

1310
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,040
Here, he took 3 good photos.

1311
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,050
I'm sure he'll tell a big story around to
his friends.

1312
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:23,280
This is the difference of approachability.

1313
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,680
Thank God, he didn't say, drive the car.

1314
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,760
I would have driven.

1315
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,109
As long as I'm free.

1316
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:28,420
As long as I have time.

1317
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,420
It doesn't matter.

1318
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,170
It's only because he was asking for it.

1319
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:32,170
I'll tell you.

1320
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:33,220
I was at the airport.

1321
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,220
A guy came running.

1322
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,540
He was using a OnePlus phone.

1323
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,540
Zen mode.

1324
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,910
In Zen mode, you can't do anything.

1325
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:39,220
He took out his phone.

1326
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,819
I was free at that time.

1327
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:42,780
I took a photo from my phone.

1328
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,780
I asked, what's your email?

1329
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,780
He got the photo.

1330
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,720
Otherwise, he wouldn't have got the photo.

1331
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,990
Just because there's approachability.

1332
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:51,920
Everybody who's watching the show, remember,
if you meet Gaurav, if he has a car, make

1333
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,010
sure you take it.

1334
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,099
It's happened many times.

1335
00:52:54,099 --> 00:52:55,099
All the time.

1336
00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:56,099
Open offer now.

1337
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:57,099
I'll come to that.

1338
00:52:57,099 --> 00:52:58,099
I'll come to that.

1339
00:52:58,099 --> 00:52:59,099
Tamil.

1340
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:00,099
Specifically asking him.

1341
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:01,099
Trolling is anonymous.

1342
00:53:01,099 --> 00:53:02,099
We've all developed a thick skin.

1343
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:03,099
I don't know.

1344
00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:04,099
I'm just presuming.

1345
00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:05,150
We continue with our work.

1346
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:10,450
When your peers roast, when your fellow YouTubers
roast, there was an incident with a Tamil.

1347
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:13,380
I would want him to talk about that.

1348
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,510
Recently that happened to me.

1349
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:15,510
Where to start?

1350
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,760
We've been in the space for a long time.

1351
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,309
Most of us got the roasting, trolling, everything.

1352
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:21,460
What we do is, we just ignore and we cross.

1353
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,460
That's what we do.

1354
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,180
If time and again, you're getting the same
kind of thing, people will start hate you

1355
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,700
for the thing which you're not

1356
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,700
doing.

1357
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,700
That's where you'll
feel uncomfortable.

1358
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,700
It happened to me too.

1359
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,900
Four years ago, a man said something wrong
in my name.

1360
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:32,900
He uploaded 3-4 videos.

1361
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:33,900
The real face of...

1362
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:38,099
The Tamil version of the video about TG in
Hindi will be uploaded on my channel.

1363
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:39,099
It used to happen.

1364
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:43,609
Someone is making fun of someone who's doing
the video in Hindi and getting some views.

1365
00:53:43,609 --> 00:53:46,390
They're following the same thing in Tamil.

1366
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,760
I know this and I ignore it.

1367
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,510
But it comes to a point where I have to show
my identity

1368
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,330
card telling this is my name.

1369
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:57,799
Tamil Selvan is my name and this is my identity
and I don't have to fake it.

1370
00:53:57,799 --> 00:53:59,020
This is where it started.

1371
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,220
There's a story ahead.

1372
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,030
There are a lot of things.

1373
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,030
It added up.

1374
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:08,210
Recently what happened is
I saw a video someone was making fun of two

1375
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:09,210
other channels.

1376
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,210
One was mine and someone's channel.

1377
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:11,320
Up to a point, I was not worried about that
particular

1378
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,600
thing because over the past few years, I came
through a lot

1379
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,600
of stuff.

1380
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,600
I ignored that one.

1381
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,200
Then all of a sudden, I got a lot of negative
things.

1382
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,910
Then I thought, what do I have to do?

1383
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:29,109
Either I have to ignore and move on or I have
to speak whatever is in my mind.

1384
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:32,059
Because there are a lot of pressures
I was building for the past few years without

1385
00:54:32,059 --> 00:54:33,059
talking
anything.

1386
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:35,380
Because YouTube, we all have our passion,
profession, whatever it is.

1387
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:38,180
I mostly don't often spend time with my friends
and everything.

1388
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,579
Most of the time, it's in my YouTube channel
itself.

1389
00:54:40,579 --> 00:54:41,819
Comment section, Twitter, everything is there.

1390
00:54:41,819 --> 00:54:44,319
The pressure got up to me and suddenly, whatever
that comes into mind, I shot a video.

1391
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,339
But I haven't uploaded that.

1392
00:54:45,339 --> 00:54:46,970
I didn't upload that video.

1393
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:48,730
I kept it as it is.

1394
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:49,730
I didn't.

1395
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:50,730
Then I stopped it.

1396
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:53,930
Then I came to know that the other person
who was in that video because I initially

1397
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:56,150
texted him bro, this is the thing
that is happening this guy, this particular

1398
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:57,490
channel is
talking about both of us.

1399
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,000
What we have to do?

1400
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,869
Because I don't have experience in facing
this kind of pure roasting.

1401
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:04,920
What we have to do?

1402
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,569
He said, simply ignore.

1403
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:07,569
That's it.

1404
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:08,569
Ignore and move on.

1405
00:55:08,569 --> 00:55:09,569
I said, okay.

1406
00:55:09,569 --> 00:55:10,569
I used to do that.

1407
00:55:10,569 --> 00:55:12,720
I will do that again.

1408
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:19,869
But that other guy went on and commented on
his channel telling that, okay, from now on

1409
00:55:19,869 --> 00:55:21,130
I'm your huge fan.

1410
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:22,130
I'm your follower.

1411
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,609
Then all the TV channels, all the other YouTube
channels, all the comment section filled with

1412
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:26,539
hate of this particular guy is the biggest
YouTuber.

1413
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:28,700
He apologized
and he commented, you are so rude and you

1414
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,829
are not even saying anything.

1415
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:31,190
That pressure got into my mind.

1416
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:39,400
Then I shot the second video not even thinking
anything whatever that comes in my mind, I

1417
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,400
shot the video.

1418
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,480
That's where I was little bit out of the way.

1419
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,060
Whatever that comes in my mind.

1420
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:51,790
I re-edited, but by that time we had some
other issues as well but I committed my subscriber

1421
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:53,920
that I will be uploading the video on Sunday.

1422
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,789
Every Sunday I will be uploading a video.

1423
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:57,869
I know the video is not 100%.

1424
00:55:57,869 --> 00:56:04,670
I don't have the time to check because the
video has to go live.

1425
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:07,360
So, first thing is
I have pressure from inside.

1426
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:11,220
Second, the day is also I have to upload the
video.

1427
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,069
Then I went on with the video.

1428
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:17,470
Once the video is live,
I switched off the phone and everything

1429
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,470
I went to sleep.

1430
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:19,640
Suddenly, the next morning, even without seeing
the

1431
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,620
comments, I realized that what have I done?

1432
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,109
You made a mistake.

1433
00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:27,089
I immediately wanted to take the video out
and give

1434
00:56:27,089 --> 00:56:28,089
something for my viewers.

1435
00:56:28,089 --> 00:56:29,089
This is not me.

1436
00:56:29,089 --> 00:56:30,260
This is what is in my mind.

1437
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:33,260
I wanted to say this and I said it like this.

1438
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,260
I was thinking.

1439
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,369
Then few other people were telling you don't
need to go and

1440
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:38,369
do this.

1441
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:39,369
Just work on it.

1442
00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:40,369
Then it started biting.

1443
00:56:40,369 --> 00:56:41,369
now we are facing the backlash.

1444
00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:42,369
What is the backlash?

1445
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:43,369
Two years back?

1446
00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:44,369
No, no, right?

1447
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:45,369
No,
six months.

1448
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:46,369
Six months.

1449
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:47,369
What is the backlash you are facing?

1450
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:48,369
Negative comments in each and every video.

1451
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:49,369
Every video.

1452
00:56:49,369 --> 00:56:50,369
I talk about Ratan Tata, I see the negative
comments.

1453
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:53,660
I make a review, telling the phone itself
is not good for

1454
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,440
that money, it's not value for money and people
started commenting you are getting some x

1455
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,240
amount of money from this brand and you are.

1456
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,630
How do you come up from that?

1457
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,220
How do you all come up from that?

1458
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,220
Yeah.

1459
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,660
Let's talk about, he is not spoken, Sanchit
is not spoken,

1460
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,240
which I am very surprised about, Sanchit.

1461
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,240
What is happening?

1462
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,720
No, no, when he told his story, it obviously
happened to me too.

1463
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,720
It has happened.

1464
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,809
Obviously, when fellow creators say it, it
hurts a lot.

1465
00:57:12,809 --> 00:57:14,270
But the best part is what happened to me.

1466
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:17,530
First, I developed full hate within myself
for a month, no doubt.

1467
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:21,240
But then, in the starting days, Shlok and
I used to talk a lot when YouTube started.

1468
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:28,680
He told me that if you hate a creator, you
will never be able to learn from him.

1469
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:36,590
What I did was, when there was a lot of build-up
inside, hate, I said, let's convert it into

1470
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,590
actions.

1471
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:40,580
Let's try to work on all this negative energy.

1472
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:45,790
What will happen if you sit quietly in the
corner and show anger?

1473
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:48,030
So now I have become a toxic trait for trolls.

1474
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:49,950
If I don't get hate, I don't get motivation.

1475
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:51,599
I look for it sometimes.

1476
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:52,599
Gaurav, Gaurav.

1477
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:53,690
I will tell you a story about Sanchit.

1478
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:56,720
I think it was 2017 or 2018.

1479
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,589
YouTube did a competition.

1480
00:57:58,589 --> 00:58:02,900
The YouTube community in India was a little
weak at that time.

1481
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,859
I mean the online community, YouTube's community.

1482
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:05,859
The overall community.

1483
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:06,859
Yes.

1484
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:08,099
So there was a
YouTube program where they collaborated with

1485
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:09,099
me.

1486
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:10,099
And they invited for entries.

1487
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:11,099
Okay.

1488
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:12,099
If you want to go on a community post, you
have to upload.

1489
00:58:12,099 --> 00:58:16,510
Like if you are a YouTuber, just to make sure
that the YouTube community's blog post gets

1490
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:17,510
a little active.

1491
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:18,510
Okay.

1492
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:19,910
So got some, I think, 3-4 thousand entries.

1493
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:20,910
We shortlisted.

1494
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,349
And I had to pick two winners with whom I
will collaborate.

1495
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:25,720
So it was a plan that we did with YouTube.

1496
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,950
So there were two winners.

1497
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:27,950
One, I picked Sanchit.

1498
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:28,950
One, I picked Samreen.

1499
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,030
Young girl was doing some sketch videos.

1500
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:32,319
So we are watching Sanchit right now, where
he is.

1501
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,210
And the other one, I think Samreen has a lot
of millions of followers.

1502
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:39,290
And I remember we shot a video in the hotel
room.

1503
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:40,290
After 2017.

1504
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:41,290
That's a great statement.

1505
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:42,940
We shot a video in the hotel room.

1506
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:43,940
Amazing statement.

1507
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:44,940
Imagination.

1508
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,940
How did you feel that time?

1509
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,940
We shot a video.

1510
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,950
How did you feel?

1511
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:49,220
It was very crazy.

1512
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,380
It was discussed in my entire college that
Technical Guruji has made a video with

1513
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,380
Sanchit.

1514
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,380
So it was crazy.

1515
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,080
It was a very crazy moment.

1516
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:01,339
In fact, I also told in my JoshTalk that how
Technical Guruji had a very big, important

1517
00:59:01,339 --> 00:59:02,680
part in my life.

1518
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,680
I will always be thankful to him.

1519
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,680
Recently, Carry Mena TV.

1520
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,680
Carry is younger brother.

1521
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,680
What is that?

1522
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,680
What happened there?

1523
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,680
It was so much fun.

1524
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:09,680
Let's have some fun.

1525
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,680
Let me show you something.

1526
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,680
Let me show you what Carry had messaged me.

1527
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,680
Okay.

1528
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,680
I think we spoke the day before yesterday
We spoke

1529
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,680
the day before yesterday.

1530
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,680
One second.

1531
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,680
See this.

1532
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,680
Let me show you.

1533
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,680
When Carry uploaded it, he said, Hello Sir.

1534
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,680
I made a small parody of yours.

1535
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,680
I hope I was able to get close to your character
and you don't take negative.

1536
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,680
Oh.

1537
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,680
Really enjoyed playing your character and
got to learn a lot.

1538
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,680
He sent me the link of the video.

1539
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,680
I was on a flight at that time.

1540
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,870
I replied to him.

1541
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:27,300
Let me show you.

1542
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:28,300
Hello brother.

1543
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,300
How are you?

1544
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,599
I just saw the video.

1545
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:31,599
I was on a flight.

1546
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,380
I was coming from New York.

1547
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,500
I was changing my flight.

1548
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,619
I just saw the video.

1549
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:39,280
I was sitting in the lounge and everyone was
laughing.

1550
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,690
I was wearing a laptop.

1551
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:41,690
It was solid.

1552
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:44,200
It must have taken a lot of effort.

1553
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,109
Carry is saying, Thank you so much.

1554
00:59:46,109 --> 00:59:48,250
It means a lot.

1555
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,250
We are having fun.

1556
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,720
When the iPhone 15 was launched, we planned
something together again.

1557
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,299
But at that time, I was traveling and you
couldn't shoot.

1558
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,299
The thing is, there are two things.

1559
00:59:55,299 --> 00:59:56,789
If someone is really attacking you for no
reason other than

1560
00:59:56,789 --> 00:59:59,440
just to bring you down, it's a different side
altogether.

1561
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,800
In Carry's case, we are people from the community.

1562
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,250
We are having fun.

1563
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:10,020
At that time, I say, see how he is, how he
is,

1564
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,280
how I am.

1565
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,280
It's fun.

1566
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,460
So the parody he made, I mean, I am seeing
attention to

1567
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,900
detail in all the characters.

1568
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,140
And people have liked my character the most.

1569
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,140
I am enjoying it.

1570
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,140
Any thoughts Shlok on roasting?

1571
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:22,539
I also align with the same thing that there
are two types

1572
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:23,539
of criticism.

1573
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:25,230
One is where there is no meaning to it and
they just want

1574
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,230
to bring you down.

1575
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:30,670
And sometimes there is a way where either
people are making fun of us or we have done

1576
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:31,670
something wrong.

1577
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,020
So a consumer or a viewer may get angry.

1578
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,630
They may abuse in anger.

1579
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:39,420
But it is our job to understand that whether
he is trying

1580
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:47,740
to forcefully insult us or he has a problem
and he is commenting on us.

1581
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:51,310
So I think, like in the case of Carry.

1582
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:54,460
The good thing about Carry is that I don't
know about

1583
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,460
others.

1584
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,990
I mean, if I call him now, he will say, hello
brother, how

1585
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:58,990
are you?

1586
01:00:58,990 --> 01:00:59,990
He has that image.

1587
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,740
What you see on camera and what you get behind
the camera is a very different thing.

1588
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,950
Yesterday or day before yesterday, I did a
reel post on Instagram.

1589
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:05,369
Vishal, the guy who wrote Carry's sketch.

1590
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:07,539
Deepak told me yesterday that he forwarded
it to the group.

1591
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:10,730
And he tells Vishal that you should take the
writing fees from Gaurav.

1592
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:12,140
He is also using your dialogue.

1593
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,190
He is having fun.

1594
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:18,140
Now, even with IBTR, till now, there will
be so many preconceived notions in people's

1595
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,140
minds.

1596
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:21,960
Immediately after looking at this, it is going
to change.

1597
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,320
Because behind the camera, a lot of things
are different.

1598
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,610
A lot of things are said in front of the camera.

1599
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:27,910
Even between tech YouTubers.

1600
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:31,290
But actually, they might be very good friends
and it might be planned.

1601
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:34,410
Or it might be said that I am going to talk
about this.

1602
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:35,410
Before going ahead, let's talk and do it.

1603
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:36,410
Can I say a small thing?

1604
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:37,930
It's a very small thing.

1605
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,730
I mean, I tell you.

1606
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:42,250
If you all align with Shahid, I am telling
you what I think.

1607
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,660
This YouTube is a new thing.

1608
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:44,839
It's a very new thing.

1609
01:01:44,839 --> 01:01:47,900
And if you look very carefully at your deep
inside, it is a

1610
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:48,900
very lonely journey.

1611
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,900
I mean, if I go to my friend, I tell him that
I didn't get

1612
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:50,980
so many views today.

1613
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,059
This topic was made.

1614
01:01:52,059 --> 01:01:53,410
I was talking on AI.

1615
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,410
People didn't like it.

1616
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,450
Someone will understand a little.

1617
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:58,240
If I talk to you, talk to Shlok, talk to Gaurav,
talk to

1618
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,240
someone.

1619
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,559
You will immediately understand that this
was your shortcoming.

1620
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:01,860
If we do the same work a little closeness.

1621
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,289
So when there are talks, it makes you feel
a little relaxed.

1622
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:04,730
It doesn't make you feel a little lonely.

1623
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:07,070
So I think that in fact, not only on the collaboration
camera.

1624
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:09,490
We should also talk to each other.

1625
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,570
Because you don't know right now.

1626
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:14,039
We have no idea what are the side effects
of YouTube.

1627
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:15,069
You are so new.

1628
01:02:15,069 --> 01:02:18,650
So I feel that there is still a lonely journey
of tech YouTubers.

1629
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:19,650
I feel so.

1630
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:20,650
Not tech, but any creator.

1631
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:21,650
Any creator.

1632
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:22,650
Actually, there are side effects.

1633
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:24,819
I mean, we saw what Lilly Singh was also going
through and everything.

1634
01:02:24,819 --> 01:02:25,819
So that's there.

1635
01:02:25,819 --> 01:02:27,069
You guys also went through some sort of controversies,
right?

1636
01:02:27,069 --> 01:02:28,069
Oh yeah, yeah.

1637
01:02:28,069 --> 01:02:29,069
I was hoping for the next question.

1638
01:02:29,069 --> 01:02:30,069
No, no, I didn't know.

1639
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:31,069
No, I addressed it.

1640
01:02:31,069 --> 01:02:32,069
It's okay.

1641
01:02:32,069 --> 01:02:33,069
No, no, there are a lot.

1642
01:02:33,069 --> 01:02:34,069
Yeah, it's the same.

1643
01:02:34,069 --> 01:02:35,069
Oh, sorry.

1644
01:02:35,069 --> 01:02:36,069
No, I didn't know that either.

1645
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:37,069
No, no, yeah.

1646
01:02:37,069 --> 01:02:38,920
The thing is, like you mentioned, there are
two types of trolls.

1647
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,730
One is obviously in a fun way that CarryMinati
has done.

1648
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:42,930
Which is his job.

1649
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:43,930
Which he does.

1650
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,500
And the second is to bring someone down.

1651
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,760
So what happened with us is that each one
of us were working with a certain brand.

1652
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,099
And we were working with them for such a long
time.

1653
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:52,960
It was quite clear.

1654
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,230
Entire tech community was working with them.

1655
01:02:56,230 --> 01:03:01,490
But one tech content creator did not get to
work with that brand.

1656
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:02,490
And that pissed that person off.

1657
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:06,549
Because of that, he wanted to retaliate in
some way or the other.

1658
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:10,440
We just caught in the crossfire.

1659
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,960
And it happened that a lot of negativity that
came from that video completely shattered

1660
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:15,960
us.

1661
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,960
I'm not lying.

1662
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,960
We were completely devastated.

1663
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,960
We were thinking, what did we do wrong?

1664
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,420
Because that was what was happening the entire
time.

1665
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,420
And so it happened.

1666
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,270
And then we thought, what should we do?

1667
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:24,600
And we did make a video.

1668
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:30,349
But later we realized that we shouldn't have.

1669
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:34,760
You shouldn't have.

1670
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:45,130
I also, I generally don't see videos.

1671
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:48,059
That time I had seen that.

1672
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:49,079
And I don't.

1673
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:53,490
And the best part to let go this is that you
should, like I

1674
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:57,440
was talking with Sanchit off camera some time
ago, that if everyone is working on their

1675
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:03,170
own and minding their own business, so the
other person should not get in the way to

1676
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,940
bring someone else
down.

1677
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:10,160
Because at the end of the day, we all have
a different

1678
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,160
style of working.

1679
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,200
I might not agree with anyone else's style,
but that is

1680
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,200
their style.

1681
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,200
I don't get in their way.

1682
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,700
Similarly, I do not want someone else to get
in our way.

1683
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,670
So that has happened with us at that time.

1684
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:22,760
So those 3-4-5 months, whatever they were,
that was one of the worst periods of our YouTube

1685
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,760
journey.

1686
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,970
And like Sanchit just mentioned, YouTube is
very lonely.

1687
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:29,880
And I couldn't share that problem or discuss
it with anyone.

1688
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,970
No one would understand.

1689
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:34,440
And obviously I can't be able to, I won't
be able to

1690
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,450
discuss it with fellow YouTubers as well.

1691
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:38,080
Because we don't interact that regularly.

1692
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,080
We don't interact.

1693
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:44,450
It was a lesson learned that whenever something
like that happens, don't take any action.

1694
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:50,410
Just go on and mind your own business because
that will be useful and that worked for us.

1695
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:53,880
But I think one of the most important things
if you notice,

1696
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,539
all the people who have spoken so far, everybody
has at the end of it said there was a lesson.

1697
01:04:58,539 --> 01:05:06,260
I think trolls, negativity, absolutely agree,
there are two types of negativity, but I think

1698
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,650
the comment section is your greatest learning
tool.

1699
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:08,650
Enemy also.

1700
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:11,289
Koi aur nahi aayega aapko guide karne ke liye
better because as you said, kabhi galti ho

1701
01:05:11,289 --> 01:05:14,980
jaye and the people flame you for it, you
learn from it and become better.

1702
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:21,480
He is six months down the line, he is a much
better, where they have gone after the lesson

1703
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,480
they have learned.

1704
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,940
Wo jo ek aapka six months of loneliness tha,
at maybe your worst period, but see where

1705
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:26,940
you are today.

1706
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:29,029
Most of it will come from that six month journey.

1707
01:05:29,029 --> 01:05:30,480
Kitni learning thi, kitna lesson tha.

1708
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,640
You never fail, you either learn or you win.

1709
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,569
I think this is a very important thing.

1710
01:05:34,569 --> 01:05:37,220
It's not that never fail, a lot of times there
are

1711
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:38,910
instances where things like this have happened.

1712
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:43,270
The channel has gone down, views have gone
down and the key going down and it never comes

1713
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:44,270
up.

1714
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:45,270
Aise hua hai.

1715
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:46,450
Either thing is, I'll tell you honestly, ignore
kar do,

1716
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:47,450
that is the best.

1717
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:50,329
If someone's trying to pull you down, it simply
means you stand above them.

1718
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:51,329
Yeah, yeah.

1719
01:05:51,329 --> 01:05:52,329
You're important enough for them to want to
pull you down.

1720
01:05:52,329 --> 01:05:57,020
My point was, ek bar wo jane ke baad, how
do you come up, especially for an established

1721
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,020
person.

1722
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:01,799
Ek baat sunna hai, Devendra yeh cheez hui,
wo phase nikla, let's say kal yeh cheez dubara

1723
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:04,980
ho jati hai, now you are in
a better position to deal.

1724
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:05,980
Much better, yes.

1725
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:08,960
Toh ek baar ka experience tha, but now it's
a learning for

1726
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:09,960
a lifetime.

1727
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:10,960
Correct.

1728
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,960
Exactly.

1729
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,069
Toh I think, jo agar sunn raha hai koi isko
abhi, jisne wo sakta hai aaj tak yeh phase

1730
01:06:15,069 --> 01:06:19,049
nahi kiye hai, toh usko already pata hai ki
kya karne, kyuki hamare experiences hain.

1731
01:06:19,049 --> 01:06:21,700
Toh I think, ignore karo, side nikalo, aagey
badho, that's

1732
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:22,760
the best way out.

1733
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,470
And that's the learning jo idhar se idhar
se aari hai.

1734
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:29,440
Jaise abhi aapne bola ki, jab itna phase down
jata hai, toh usse bahar kaise nikalna hai.

1735
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:33,650
Toh ek simple sa funda hai, jo ham apne 10-12
saal ki journey mein apply kara hai hamne,

1736
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:35,760
and that is always go back to the basics.

1737
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,760
Absolutely.

1738
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,920
We just go back to the basics.

1739
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,529
If you go back to what you were doing and
jis cheez ke liye aapko logon ne, they have

1740
01:06:42,529 --> 01:06:45,190
given you the love, you go back
to that again, do it better, with the learning,

1741
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:46,190
I think
Arun, you come back.

1742
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:47,730
But I'll tell you again, yeh jo basics hai
na, yeh basics

1743
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:51,480
bhi because of algorithm change hote rehte
hai, and I don't know how many will understand

1744
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,750
this, but YouTube pe, jo 6-5-6 saal chal raha
tha, basics, ki yeh yeh aapne karna chahiye,

1745
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,510
wo agar abhi
aap apply karte ho videos ko, your videos

1746
01:06:58,510 --> 01:06:59,510
will not work.

1747
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:01,260
But Arun, I'll tell you the reasons why.

1748
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:05,270
Because wo basics ho gaye alag, because everyone
else has probably gone up, wo basics abhi

1749
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:08,089
basics rahe nahi, basics have gone to a different
level.

1750
01:07:08,089 --> 01:07:12,700
So according to me, you have to keep evolving
and understanding.

1751
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,700
But that's the basics.

1752
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:14,700
That is true.

1753
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:15,700
That is true.

1754
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:16,700
That is true.

1755
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,700
Understanding is the basics.

1756
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,330
I am not saying ki jo basics jaise aap kar
rehte hai, waise

1757
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:21,330
hi karte hoon.

1758
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:26,900
Pehle hum text karte the, phir hum videos
pe aaye, uss time jab hum videos pe aaye,

1759
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:29,530
kuch content creation, influencer, kuch bhi
nahi tha.

1760
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:35,119
We just did it because humein laga ki kuch
gap hai jo hum fill kar sakte hain.

1761
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:41,070
So we tried, we wanted to do different kind
of videos and that worked for us.

1762
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:46,660
So our basics was to always evolve, like he
said, ki evolve to karne hi padega, ab short

1763
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:52,040
videos agar aa rahe hain, agar aap short videos
nahi banaoge, that means you are harming yourself.

1764
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:57,740
Usse kisi ka kuch fayada nahi hone wala, ki
aap ussi pe gogi, nahi mai to long videos

1765
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:01,540
hi banaunga, kyuki mere ko to long videos
hi banaane aate hain.

1766
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,440
Short videos is not my thing.

1767
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,030
That is not my thing.

1768
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:06,609
Pivoting is part of being.

1769
01:08:06,609 --> 01:08:09,839
So basics is that you should always be with
the trend.

1770
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:13,720
Kahi baar agar ahead of the trend ho toh,
toh sab sahchi baat hai.

1771
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:17,660
Be the disruptor or you will be disrupted
is a basic.

1772
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:23,929
And I think Shlok, what Shlok has done with
the overlays, I think he is with the curve,

1773
01:08:23,929 --> 01:08:26,640
ahead of the curve, I must say.

1774
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,380
Jo next category after content hai, that is
definitely

1775
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:33,560
product and he has built a really nice product.

1776
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,560
Yeah, yeah.

1777
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,029
Or not one, multiple products.

1778
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,790
Toh wo ek jacket hai.

1779
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:39,910
Yeh jacket kisi ki hai yaar?

1780
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:41,679
Yeh badhi achi jacket hai.

1781
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:43,089
Badhi achi jacket hai.

1782
01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:46,970
Yeh monetization mein e-commerce, that's also
going to be huge, right?

1783
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:50,390
I was coming to this, like how do you see
it

1784
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:51,390
as a business?

1785
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:56,109
I think this is a great topic, even I am going
to get into

1786
01:08:56,109 --> 01:08:57,109
this.

1787
01:08:57,109 --> 01:09:00,259
Main apna waise is pehle purane wale topic
mein apna opinion deta hu.

1788
01:09:00,259 --> 01:09:02,930
Kyuki I feel ki sometimes ignoring is not
enough.

1789
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:07,980
Kyuki mereko aisa rakhta hai ki market mein
jo cheez jada boli jaati ho, sach ban jaati

1790
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:13,540
toh agar ek banda kuch bol raha hai and wo
das bandon ko inspire kar deta wo same cheez

1791
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:17,910
bolne ke liye, toh cheez sach ban jaati, agar
saamne ala banda reply na kare.

1792
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:19,660
Mere kyaal seâ€¦
Off camera hai.

1793
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:25,450
Yeh hi wali baat mein abhi aapko bolna chahata,
jab baaki log bol rahe the ignore ka, I completely

1794
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:26,450
agree with you.

1795
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:33,589
Mere zaap se theek hai, agar matlab it does
not make sense aur koi usko wo nahi dera hai,

1796
01:09:33,589 --> 01:09:35,790
tawajjo nahi dera hai, toh
it is okay.

1797
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:39,069
But agar if it, I see it becoming a thing
and mereko lagta

1798
01:09:39,069 --> 01:09:43,710
hai ki nahi yeh galat hai, toh main toh fight
karne ke liye ready, main apna stand lene

1799
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:45,770
ke liye, main laddi pe chal
rahe ho.

1800
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:50,409
Aap gali mein chal rahe ho aur kuttey aapko
attack kar rahe hain, ek tarika yeh ki aap

1801
01:09:50,409 --> 01:09:53,500
ruk ke her ek pe patthar
pekhoge, patthar katham ho jayenge surat-darbaad

1802
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:57,969
ho sakta hai aur kuttey bhadte ja rahe hain,
second option is aap unko biscuit fekho, toh

1803
01:09:57,969 --> 01:10:02,739
kuttey aap ke beeche pooch laate bheyenge,
toh my thing is ki agar aap ignore na karo

1804
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:07,219
aur agar aap jawaab dere ho, toh bhai that's
what they want, they want more attention,

1805
01:10:07,219 --> 01:10:11,699
that's what they want, toh wo cycle ban jayega,
ek hai ki kutton ko jawaab dena,

1806
01:10:11,699 --> 01:10:15,050
ek hai ki jo actual reality hai, wo logon
wo dikhana, bhai

1807
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:20,650
but wo kab tak karoge wo toh batao, but mere
kya se, at the end toh ignore karna hi padega,

1808
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:25,800
at the end toh ignore karna padega, but did
you answer to the guy who had, I remember

1809
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:30,780
this story, I
don't know how many people remember but jab

1810
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:35,030
e-commerce brand launch ki layers launch kiya
tha, wo coding ka, arre

1811
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:39,790
na aapko simple 3 baat, main flight pe tha
and you asked me ki maine reply karna chahiye

1812
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:42,770
ya nahi, we were going to US
or somewhere at that

1813
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:47,390
time, na wo simple story azaat hoon, ek hua
gaya hum website bana rahe the, website mein

1814
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:50,920
mockups hote hain, sari cheezon hote hain,
wo publicly available hota hain, and

1815
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,659
code jo hai, aap google ka code copy karo,
koi aapko kuch bolega nahi, kyu hi it is

1816
01:10:55,659 --> 01:11:00,150
not copyrighted ya koi ispe patent attendant
toh laga nahi, humne ek developer hire raha

1817
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:05,239
tha, usne halka halka code idhar udhar utha
liya, and ek jo competitor tha, kyu hi hum

1818
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:09,729
market mein agar ghus rahe hain, skins ki
hum market mein jaa rahe hain, toh

1819
01:11:09,729 --> 01:11:12,130
of course jo pehle jo competitor uski market
jaayegi, toh

1820
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:16,670
wo humko bhai publicly aake ki, haan yeh kar
diya, yeh copy karta, yeh karta, wo karta

1821
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:21,210
hai, manager wo theek hai bhai, haan hogi
hogi galti, theek hai koi baat nahi, but uske

1822
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:24,679
baad like wo humare
upar ek legal notice bhai ne vej diya, maine

1823
01:11:24,679 --> 01:11:27,890
poore check
kar waha hai ki bhai yeh isme kya hai, yeh

1824
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:28,890
toh basic cheez

1825
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:34,250
hain, mockup toh publicly available hota hain,
sari cheez hain aisa kuch, it is not, it is

1826
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:37,159
legally okay to do it,
yaar Instagram ne bhi

1827
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:41,610
toh stories copy kari hain, humne aisa kuch
khaas copy nahi kar raha tha, humne website

1828
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:46,760
bhi change kar di thi, but uske baad we filed
ek, humne wapas legal notice bheja, ki hum

1829
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,989
defamation file karenge, agar aap jo aap cheez
kar raho, publicly kar raho,

1830
01:11:50,989 --> 01:11:55,870
uske baad then he stopped, kyunki usko bataegi,
usko jisko actual solution chahiye hota hai

1831
01:11:55,870 --> 01:12:01,320
na, wo publicly halla nahi bachaata, and mereko
wo cheez bhagi ki, of course, yaar aap kahin

1832
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,909
bhi kisi market aap jaoge, log peeche kheechne
aa jaate hain, toh

1833
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:08,489
it depends ki kab reply karna hai, kab nahin
karna hai, so

1834
01:12:08,489 --> 01:12:12,310
you replied basically and you took it forward
and, ab wo

1835
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:18,260
uska kaam ban chuke, wo baar baar kuch kuch
naya lata rhta hai, main dekhta rhta hoon,

1836
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:21,110
usko maza aa gaya aise hi humein, but even
I only

1837
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:24,389
feel like you have to give a reply because
we don't have to bottle up our mental health

1838
01:12:24,389 --> 01:12:28,820
also, because, yaar taste wise, taste wise,
agar wo nahi, if he does, no I myself roster

1839
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:31,940
companies, so I, he is doing it hot, I do
skits based on

1840
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:34,820
you know, what are
the, no he is way of thinking, it's a controller,

1841
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:39,340
yeh bahut difficult to understand, ki troll
ne sach bola hai mere baare mein galat, ya

1842
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:44,460
phir wo faalto bol raha hai, agar aap realize
kar gaye apni mistake, toh shayad wo aapki

1843
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,670
sabse greatest learning ho

1844
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:53,090
gaye, aap curve hi badal raha hai, but I agree
with Gaurav ki like, bhai at the end toh ignore

1845
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:59,970
karna hi padega na, haan haan, mada, otherwise
it is going to affect you, let's go back to

1846
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:02,380
the question that we are all waiting for,
what you are doing, journey

1847
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:07,239
kaise hai, e-commerce, if it's the big one,
do you believe that, does it take you away

1848
01:13:07,239 --> 01:13:12,650
from your core, sabse bada question hi hai,
ki jo, jis cheez ne aapko banaya hai, kya

1849
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:17,110
usmein ab aap utna hi passion aur time daal
par rahe ho, content creator?

1850
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:20,870
It,
mere kya haal se toh, 100% it is the future,

1851
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:24,969
100% ek product ko agar aap distribution jo,
mada hum essentially videos bana rahe hain

1852
01:13:24,969 --> 01:13:29,890
hum sab log, agar aap ek accha product ek
aise cheez aap le aao, jo aapki audience isme

1853
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:33,510
interested hai, it is a billion
dollar business, I am, main usko bilkul kam

1854
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:36,610
nahi kar raha, agar audience fit sahi hai,
jaise

1855
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:38,739
I have talked to physics wala, he has built
a billion

1856
01:13:38,739 --> 01:13:42,460
dollar business, Unacademy ke founders bhi
start unhoni YouTube se kar raha tha, kaafi

1857
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:45,909
saari India mein log hai,
jino ne business banaya hai YouTube ko leke,

1858
01:13:45,909 --> 01:13:50,429
bas mere kya haal se dikkat hi ho jaati
hai, usually jab log start karte hain, wo

1859
01:13:50,429 --> 01:13:53,620
product ko for granted le leta hai, unko lagta
hai ki, manlab,

1860
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:56,540
We can make a product and the audience will
buy it.

1861
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:58,219
I think to build that product, whether it's
a physics

1862
01:13:58,219 --> 01:14:00,940
product or my own reference, it took us 3
years to make a skin.

1863
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:02,180
It took us 3 years to learn clothes,

1864
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:03,180
I have a whole industry to learn.

1865
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,180
And if I remove the layers from TechBurner,
because there

1866
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:05,620
is no distribution of TechBurner, but layers
in itself, no

1867
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:08,131
one else in the market is able to beat that
product.

1868
01:14:08,131 --> 01:14:09,131
I am saying globally.

1869
01:14:09,131 --> 01:14:11,260
No one else is able to make a product like
that.

1870
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:14,670
Same thing that we are making in clothing,
H&M, Zara, all the international brands, the

1871
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:18,810
price point at
which we are making jackets, no one is able

1872
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:20,790
to make it.

1873
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:25,690
So I think if the product is good, then it
becomes easy to leverage that thing.

1874
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:29,300
But the reputation you have made, what you
do today, the

1875
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:32,480
way you have got love from people, credibility
from people, when you make a product and your

1876
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:38,330
jacket goes out, have you not got criticism
that it has become commercial?

1877
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:43,710
Number 2, now you are not making yourself
vulnerable, that people will start saying,

1878
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:46,540
I bought a jacket, it turned out to be useless,
my button

1879
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,540
came off.

1880
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,890
I am not saying this is the truth,
I am saying I keep getting asked this question.

1881
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:53,719
Is this vulnerability in your mind, at the
back of your

1882
01:14:53,719 --> 01:14:54,719
head?

1883
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:55,719
100%.

1884
01:14:55,719 --> 01:14:58,530
I mean, when things are going on so publicly,
and

1885
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:00,130
negativity spreads more quickly.

1886
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:02,880
Now, if there is a slight delay in delivery,
if it is of

1887
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,020
one person, then it will create more noise.

1888
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:07,420
The thousands of happy customers, lakhs of
happy customers,

1889
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,820
they just put up a photo and stay happy.

1890
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:10,820
But negativity spreads.

1891
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:14,480
But in our case, because the audience showed
so much trust, this has not happened.

1892
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,020
There was a very positive response.

1893
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:19,020
And I am personally very happy.

1894
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:22,310
And I feel very grateful that our community
shows so much love.

1895
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:25,570
But, in my opinion, it is obviously your intention.

1896
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:29,540
If it is your intention to provide genuine
value, then the customer in front of you feels

1897
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:30,540
it.

1898
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:31,850
So, there is no problem in that.

1899
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:34,090
How do you change your audience into a community?

1900
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:35,090
This will be very important.

1901
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:38,440
Because, there is an audience that watches
your videos, and there is an audience that

1902
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,040
will buy your clothes.

1903
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,040
Right?

1904
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,380
So, how do you change that?

1905
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:46,420
Or, you know, how do you build a community
in general?

1906
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,260
Even B-Bomb has done it.

1907
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:50,170
How do you build a community?

1908
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:55,240
In my opinion, there is no rocket science.

1909
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:58,210
In my opinion, the product is very simple.

1910
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:00,120
If you show it well, it will sell well.

1911
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,580
But, I will actually call it the opposite.

1912
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:05,520
That, I felt that when I didn't start this
brand, that if I

1913
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,489
do a promotion, then I am selling to the audience
of Techburner.

1914
01:16:08,489 --> 01:16:09,719
They will feel weird.

1915
01:16:09,719 --> 01:16:10,949
This is my question.

1916
01:16:10,949 --> 01:16:12,450
But, it was the opposite.

1917
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:18,670
When we built our product, we shared the whole
story, people got more connected with us.

1918
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:23,000
That, this guy is doing something, he is trying
something.

1919
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,190
And, the more we share, that we are doing
this, we are

1920
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:33,680
doing this, we are doing all these things,
we are planning this, people get more attracted.

1921
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,320
And, I didn't expect this.

1922
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,159
I thought it was the opposite.

1923
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,150
That, if we sell, people will go away.

1924
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:40,270
It has become very commercial.

1925
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:42,300
But, when we started showing, people started
coming closer.

1926
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,300
More people came.

1927
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,300
And, this happens every time.

1928
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,370
I mean, whenever we share our story, of layers,
of

1929
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:47,449
overlays, people get more connected.

1930
01:16:47,449 --> 01:16:48,449
Maybe, it is an inspiration.

1931
01:16:48,449 --> 01:16:49,730
Maybe, they see that we are working hard.

1932
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:51,370
We are just selling to earn money.

1933
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:53,630
But, I don't know what it is.

1934
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:57,520
But, I try that our products that we are making,
are strong.

1935
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,780
And, your time management, are you still being
able to put

1936
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:03,060
in the same amount of time that you used to
do before, in content creation for Techburner?

1937
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,060
No.

1938
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,060
This is not possible.

1939
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:06,060
No.

1940
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,060
This is not possible.

1941
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:08,060
No.

1942
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:09,060
For a lot of people, that's what's missing.

1943
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,060
I think, for everyone.

1944
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,060
I mean, we all work so hard.

1945
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,060
You are also running so many businesses.

1946
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,300
We all do different things.

1947
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,420
And, everyone has less time.

1948
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:19,659
But, earlier, I wasn't able to give that much
time.

1949
01:17:19,659 --> 01:17:21,780
Earlier, I was a beggar.

1950
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:23,670
But, there is a difference.

1951
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:25,120
Earlier, the optimization was not that good.

1952
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,120
Now, things are optimized.

1953
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,500
I think, with time, we used to do it in 8
hours.

1954
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,370
Now, we can do it in 1 hour.

1955
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:35,280
So, if we have 1 hour today, it's enough for
the earlier editing comparison.

1956
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,199
I think, that's done, over time.

1957
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,120
Here, it's also about team building.

1958
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:41,040
You have to build teams also.

1959
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,650
That's the most crucial part.

1960
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:46,659
I mean,
I think, it's your role now to build the best

1961
01:17:46,659 --> 01:17:47,659
team.

1962
01:17:47,659 --> 01:17:48,659
That also reduces loneliness.

1963
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:53,010
Team building, reduces a lot of loneliness,
which I felt.

1964
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:54,070
Over time.

1965
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:55,380
I don't feel lonely at all.

1966
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:56,740
I, because, it is a, on-term journey.

1967
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:59,550
I feel,
I might be alone, but I am not lonely.

1968
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:00,550
Yeah.

1969
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:01,550
I enjoy it.

1970
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:03,540
I am alone, but I don't have a problem with
being alone.

1971
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:08,430
I think, community building, if it happens,
community is built, then, it happens for a

1972
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:09,430
short time.

1973
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:11,730
Let's say, 5 years, 6 years.

1974
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:14,489
I feel, community, is a fear.

1975
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:15,730
Like, I have a self-opinion.

1976
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:18,210
I have made a new theory.

1977
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:19,210
Maybe, I am wrong.

1978
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:20,210
Tell me.

1979
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:21,210
I am learning.

1980
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:22,210
I think,
I have made a new theory.

1981
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:23,949
It happened after a while.

1982
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:24,949
It faded.

1983
01:18:24,949 --> 01:18:26,920
A legacy, what does it do?

1984
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:27,920
It works quietly.

1985
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,310
I mean,
I am working.

1986
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:31,480
I am doing the same work.

1987
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,630
I am improving.

1988
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:34,150
It's been many years.

1989
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:35,300
Come, see, go.

1990
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:38,770
Bro, I will give you an example, for content
creators.

1991
01:18:38,770 --> 01:18:41,000
Our audience, every year, people move away
from it.

1992
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,969
The one who was watching us till yesterday,
he got a job.

1993
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,860
He is not watching you now.

1994
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:47,120
He was in college.

1995
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,389
He was watching you.

1996
01:18:48,389 --> 01:18:55,239
And the new guy, who got a new phone, he will
start watching you.

1997
01:18:55,239 --> 01:19:00,330
So, the crop, will always, it won't be like,
it's been 10 years, and he is watching you

1998
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:01,330
since day 1.

1999
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:02,330
No.

2000
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:03,530
And if it is like that, then his interest
may be, earlier

2001
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:04,530
it was more.

2002
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:05,530
Now, he watches you sometimes.

2003
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:06,810
What is the difference?

2004
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:10,400
So, the crop will always come out, and the
new crop will come.

2005
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,873
But what is the difference in what you said?

2006
01:19:11,873 --> 01:19:13,210
When you build a community, that is a term.

2007
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:16,610
And a legacy, it eventually comes to, the
legacy is about community.

2008
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:18,280
So, what is the difference?

2009
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:21,530
I wish,
I could name drop a bit, but I won't do that.

2010
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,530
For obvious reasons.

2011
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:25,710
I have seen, those who have cult following,
after a time, just as a general statement,

2012
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:27,780
I am giving someone's name, let's talk about
vloggers.

2013
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:28,780
He had a community.

2014
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:32,250
Means, I will say this, if he said, today
at 12,

2015
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:35,230
I am coming here,
India Gate, everyone comes.

2016
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:38,870
But, over time, that cult following, goes
like this.

2017
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:43,110
But, if there is a vlogger, who is doing his
work, quietly,

2018
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:48,960
and like this, means, he is not doing community,
community, he is not giving a name.

2019
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,520
So, I have just noticed, that, the line of
the creator

2020
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,520
increases.

2021
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,679
May be I am wrong.

2022
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:57,040
May be I am wrong.

2023
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,660
But, I feel that, he is banning his followers,
in such a

2024
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:04,850
way, that, do more community, community, cult
following happens.

2025
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:07,770
But, you are right about one thing, till date,
in history,

2026
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:09,540
you, from the time, humanity has come.

2027
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:10,550
This is absolutely right.

2028
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:13,340
Cult following, it's called a cult, because,
it is for a

2029
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:14,340
period of time.

2030
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:16,370
There is no such thing, as cult following
forever.

2031
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:17,380
This is absolutely right.

2032
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:22,150
According to me, two things, like, I was listening
to everyone, so, there are two types of people,

2033
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:27,159
one type of people, who know you, and, one
type of people, who want to become like you.

2034
01:20:27,159 --> 01:20:30,300
So, like, when a person, is young, or a child,
so, may be,

2035
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,790
he wants to become like you.

2036
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:36,350
When he grows up, then he realizes, no, I
don't want to become like him.

2037
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:38,020
I want to become like Shahrukh Khan.

2038
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:40,060
Or, I want to become like someone else.

2039
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:41,430
So, the people, who,

2040
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:47,260
So, the people, who want to become like you,
or, the things you are doing, they want to

2041
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:50,890
do something like that, that,
is your, actual, follower base, community,

2042
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:53,520
or cult,
whatever you want to call it.

2043
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:59,460
And, the people who know you, okay, they know
you, but, may be, they want to watch your

2044
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,460
videos sometimes.

2045
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:03,739
So, I, personally, look at it, by dividing
it into these

2046
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:04,739
two.

2047
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:07,590
If you are doing something different, something
strong, then, there is a question here, this

2048
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:11,150
community, is it same, for, YouTube also,
for, social media, is it the same?

2049
01:21:11,150 --> 01:21:13,219
I mean,
Instagram, Facebook, everything is different.

2050
01:21:13,219 --> 01:21:14,219
Everything is different.

2051
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:16,530
In fact,
I also want to ask, because, we have,

2052
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:21,350
Rajivji here, you know, as a medium, you have
been, on every platform, including TV,

2053
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:25,260
YouTube, social media, social media, you are
doing very, very well.

2054
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,030
How is it different, working, with, community?

2055
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:30,449
I mean, how do you build a community, on each
platform?

2056
01:21:30,449 --> 01:21:32,550
Is it different, or, is it the same?

2057
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:34,870
No, actually, there is a lot of difference.

2058
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:38,650
First example, the same person, who follows
you on YouTube, and, who follows you on Instagram,

2059
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:40,600
he comes with a completely, different psychology,
when he, opens Instagram, and, when he comes

2060
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,120
to watch you on YouTube.

2061
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:45,320
It could be the same person, but, he comes
with a very,

2062
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:48,659
different psychology, of what he, what he
wants to consume, on a different platform.

2063
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:52,719
When he turns on the TV, with what mindset
did he turn it on?

2064
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,270
When he turns on the radio, and he is going
home from office, to, you know, somewhere

2065
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:58,270
else.

2066
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:00,430
This, community expectation, from the same
person, he can have four different expectations,

2067
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:01,430
from you.

2068
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:03,050
Number one,
I think, this is a very important, realization,

2069
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:06,989
for all of
us, but more important, for all those people,

2070
01:22:06,989 --> 01:22:08,300
who will now come up.

2071
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:10,670
That you, don't think that, your YouTube following,
has

2072
01:22:10,670 --> 01:22:11,670
become very good.

2073
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:14,350
So, you will go on Instagram, even if you
have, pivoted

2074
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:17,600
very well, but the person, is not expecting
you, to do the

2075
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,600
same thing.

2076
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,120
You know, you open Instagram, you want immediately,
you may have only, one, one and a half minutes,

2077
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,980
you want, either
just entertainment, you want your mind to

2078
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,120
be, you didn't
search for it, it was delivered to you.

2079
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,920
I will also add a secret to this, that I,
like I also, when

2080
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,940
I go, one day I went to the bank,
I was at work,

2081
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:34,800
So I met a girl there, she took a selfie with
me and all

2082
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,170
that
And she didn't even know what a tech burner

2083
01:22:37,170 --> 01:22:39,860
is
She didn't even know that I make long videos

2084
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:44,400
She just saw my video on Facebook
And the 3-minute video that we cut and put

2085
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,870
on Facebook
She just saw that video

2086
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:49,180
And then I went and checked
That our Facebook audience

2087
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,800
The YouTube Shorts audience
The YouTube audience

2088
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,280
The Instagram audience
All of them are 60% different 60% audience

2089
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,699
is different everywhere
And a lot of people don't even know that we

2090
01:22:55,699 --> 01:23:01,320
make long videos A lot of people don't even
know that we do tech reviews

2091
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:05,420
A lot of people think that I just upload photos
It is like that

2092
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,670
You have to have a long-format video
Even for Shorts and for Reel

2093
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:10,690
You can't just put whatever you made for the
Reel

2094
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:14,940
You have to put a little short
If you take for granted a platform's community

2095
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:18,190
or following You will not be able to build
anything ever again

2096
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:21,550
So Arun, the answer to this thing is that
Community building is per platform

2097
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:23,710
It is not
If I take my TV audience

2098
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:28,000
It will definitely come
It will get some initial momentum

2099
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,570
Because people are like, I have seen this
on TV

2100
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:34,180
But the rest of it
Has to be organically built

2101
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:37,980
And it is for that platform only Right As
an entire

2102
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:40,949
I have so many platforms
I don't use the word community Which platform,

2103
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:41,949
Gaurav
Which platform do you think is more relevant

2104
01:23:41,949 --> 01:23:45,060
Or probably the platform of the future
Next What is the next big thing

2105
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:47,790
Let's hear it from everybody
Let's start from Arun

2106
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:50,500
What's the next big thing?

2107
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,440
Reels is going to be the big thing for me.

2108
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,500
It's been 3 years.

2109
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,820
What's the next big thing?

2110
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:56,820
It will continue.

2111
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:57,820
It will continue for sure.

2112
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:59,550
Because they are already working on EIS and
a lot of stuff.

2113
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:00,550
So, it will continue.

2114
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:03,430
I think Instagram Reel is doing pretty well
right now.

2115
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:05,900
But I don't see it as a long-term thing.

2116
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:08,110
I think people will get bored eventually.

2117
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:09,310
But we don't know when that will happen.

2118
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:10,360
Let's hope it doesn't happen.

2119
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:11,449
We are working so hard.

2120
01:24:11,449 --> 01:24:12,449
Exactly.

2121
01:24:12,449 --> 01:24:13,449
But, yes, next.

2122
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:14,449
I'll answer.

2123
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:15,449
Oh, sorry.

2124
01:24:15,449 --> 01:24:16,640
I think the next big thing is going to be
Metaverse.

2125
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:20,590
And that is what I believe.

2126
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:21,690
Something big is going to happen.

2127
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:23,380
But it will take time.

2128
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:26,590
It's not like it will happen tomorrow or the
next year.

2129
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:27,590
YouTube Shorts will co-exist.

2130
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:31,900
But, yes, one thing that I see as a platform
is that the shoppable experience, social commerce,

2131
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:35,949
will increase with the help of Shorts, with
the help of Reels.

2132
01:24:35,949 --> 01:24:41,800
And I'm seeing that, as of now, there are
links in the description.

2133
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,820
So, TikTok has been testing this in other
countries.

2134
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:48,159
As soon as I wear a T-shirt or an overlay
coat on the

2135
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:52,350
video, if I tap on it, from there only I can
buy anything.

2136
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:56,220
You know, you actually answered the next big
thing already.

2137
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:58,190
So, take it back.

2138
01:24:58,190 --> 01:25:03,370
That without it looking like it is commercial
e-commerce, great content, without making

2139
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:06,210
you say, buy this, do this,
you will have to do it organically.

2140
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:07,210
But that is where the future really lies.

2141
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:09,679
I'd love to hear from you.

2142
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:15,130
MetaQuest, I don't think it's going to take
long.

2143
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:17,750
Even I, in three to four years...

2144
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:20,710
How many of us have used MetaQuest 3?

2145
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:24,449
If you use it, you immediately come to know
that is what is going to really appeal to

2146
01:25:24,449 --> 01:25:26,300
the audiences in coming two, three years.

2147
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:27,330
Photos are still messy.

2148
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:28,520
So, not a lot of people...

2149
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:29,520
Who does all this mess?

2150
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,520
You can see the potential.

2151
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:31,520
I disagree.

2152
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,340
I was taught as a kid to sit a little further
away and

2153
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:34,340
watch TV.

2154
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:37,060
The small TV, 30-inch TV, sit a little further
away and

2155
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:38,060
watch it.

2156
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:39,060
A small 30-inch TV.

2157
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:40,060
What is a 21-inch TV?

2158
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:41,060
I had a 21-inch TV.

2159
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:42,369
You know, the eyes are here.

2160
01:25:42,369 --> 01:25:44,369
4K, 4K, two TVs with the eyes here.

2161
01:25:44,369 --> 01:25:45,860
Put the headset on and watch.

2162
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:47,110
I don't find it healthy.

2163
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:48,639
It's a matter of health too.

2164
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:52,889
See, again, this is the difference between
Gen X, Gen Y, Millennials.

2165
01:25:52,889 --> 01:25:59,230
The people who are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
years old have these two.

2166
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:01,170
They will be on it all the time.

2167
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:02,570
Because you don't have that baggage.

2168
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:03,570
I disagree.

2169
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:05,590
I don't think it's healthy.

2170
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:06,590
It's healthy.

2171
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:08,989
That's a different topic altogether.

2172
01:26:08,989 --> 01:26:11,909
AI, is it healthy or unhealthy?

2173
01:26:11,909 --> 01:26:12,909
It's different.

2174
01:26:12,909 --> 01:26:16,730
I'm saying that there has been a lot of testing
even for,

2175
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:19,630
you know, beyond Gen Z also.

2176
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:20,630
Right?

2177
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:23,110
The thing that is humanly very awkward, no
one does it.

2178
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:24,770
Why do 3D glasses fail?

2179
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:27,530
Why do people not want to watch 3D movies?

2180
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:30,830
Why do people not want to watch 3D movies?

2181
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:33,400
Even in the cinema hall, we don't...

2182
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:37,210
To strap on something, to keep something on,
that is not generational.

2183
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:40,670
But everybody is expecting the Apple Vision
Pro to change things.

2184
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:41,670
Exactly.

2185
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:42,670
I completely disagree.

2186
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:46,650
I feel that it will be the biggest failure
for Apple.

2187
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:49,080
I used PS VR to make that video in 25 days.

2188
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:51,630
I vomited three times to make that video.

2189
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:52,650
That's what I'm saying.

2190
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:53,949
I've been doing it since then.

2191
01:26:53,949 --> 01:26:57,440
You're using it while you're standing and
moving.

2192
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,650
It's a different thing.

2193
01:26:58,650 --> 01:27:01,890
If you're watching a movie while sitting,
it's a different thing.

2194
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:04,670
If you are moving, content around you is moving.

2195
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:07,760
For example, FPV drones, you can't fly it
while standing.

2196
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:13,490
A FPV drone pilot will always fly it while
sitting.

2197
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:19,550
Because if he flies it while standing, he
can see that I'm flying.

2198
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:21,240
He can't feel the gravity.

2199
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,240
So there's a disconnect.

2200
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:23,440
It's the same thing.

2201
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:28,080
But if you do it while sitting, it's a different
thing.

2202
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,690
There's a test I'm talking about for 12 to
15 year olds.

2203
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:33,469
95% of them said after 15 minutes.

2204
01:27:33,469 --> 01:27:34,469
The wow factor.

2205
01:27:34,469 --> 01:27:35,469
Oh my God!

2206
01:27:35,469 --> 01:27:36,469
The world I've gone into.

2207
01:27:36,469 --> 01:27:38,699
After 15 to 20 minutes, would you buy it?

2208
01:27:38,699 --> 01:27:41,180
Would you want to do it again?

2209
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,280
94% said no.

2210
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:50,739
But the harsh reality is, whether you like
it or not, there will be a change in the future.

2211
01:27:50,739 --> 01:27:51,739
Yes.

2212
01:27:51,739 --> 01:27:52,739
But is this the future?

2213
01:27:52,739 --> 01:27:53,739
Is this the future?

2214
01:27:53,739 --> 01:27:54,739
It's not in perfect form.

2215
01:27:54,739 --> 01:27:55,739
Please understand.

2216
01:27:55,739 --> 01:27:56,739
It's in its third generation.

2217
01:27:56,739 --> 01:27:58,550
It will be much easier.

2218
01:27:58,550 --> 01:28:00,040
You'll be wearing glasses.

2219
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,409
You remember the Google Glass?

2220
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:03,400
It was back in 2011-2012.

2221
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:04,400
I think something will happen.

2222
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,390
If it comes in contact lenses,
I see a future.

2223
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:09,580
I think it makes reality happen.

2224
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:10,639
Vision Pro.

2225
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:14,699
And even nowadays, like the iPhone is coming
up with special videos.

2226
01:28:14,699 --> 01:28:17,900
I feel Apple,
I don't know if they have a plan, but what

2227
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:23,030
if they've come up with a different platform
where you can load special videos so that

2228
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:24,980
it will be more lively.

2229
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:28,070
Maybe that's something which can be looked
at.

2230
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:31,480
You'll still have to wear it.

2231
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:38,929
Yeah, but maybe like what Guruji said, what
if it's like a glass?

2232
01:28:38,929 --> 01:28:39,929
Eventually, it will go that way.

2233
01:28:39,929 --> 01:28:40,929
Yeah.

2234
01:28:40,929 --> 01:28:41,929
It can't be that big.

2235
01:28:41,929 --> 01:28:42,929
It cannot carry that.

2236
01:28:42,929 --> 01:28:43,929
I remember my first VR experience.

2237
01:28:43,929 --> 01:28:44,929
It was with Samsung S7.

2238
01:28:44,929 --> 01:28:46,860
When S7 and S7 Edge came, the Galaxy VR, where
you had to put your phone.

2239
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:48,750
The phone had a quad HD screen.

2240
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,440
So comparatively, it used to be sharp.

2241
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,949
And at that time, it had all those different
theater modes

2242
01:28:53,949 --> 01:28:56,840
that it will create a virtual theater.

2243
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,739
I think it was in 2016.

2244
01:28:58,739 --> 01:28:59,739
It was fun.

2245
01:28:59,739 --> 01:29:02,840
And today, when I tried
Apple Vision Pro in June,

2246
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:05,500
I had a 45 minutes in-depth session.

2247
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:06,769
It was night and day.

2248
01:29:06,769 --> 01:29:09,760
I mean, there's no comparison from any VR
to Apple VR.

2249
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:10,760
Google Cardboard to Apple VR.

2250
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:11,760
Exactly.

2251
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:12,760
Google Cardboard, where your phone is connected.

2252
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:13,760
It's the same thing.

2253
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,140
The phones used to be so big.

2254
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:16,140
And today, they're folding.

2255
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:17,640
Basically, things will change in the future.

2256
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,670
It would be like a normal glass.

2257
01:29:19,670 --> 01:29:21,250
This has a camera.

2258
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:22,250
This has a speaker.

2259
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:23,739
In this, you'll see the position and everything.

2260
01:29:23,739 --> 01:29:25,570
We're going to move forward with smartphones.

2261
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:28,170
Whether it's 5 or 10 years from now.

2262
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:29,170
Exactly.

2263
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:32,380
What is the one future tech that you are seeing
future in?

2264
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:33,380
I mean, AI.

2265
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:34,380
Variable technologies.

2266
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:35,380
Variable technologies.

2267
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:36,380
Humane.

2268
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:37,380
Humane kind of things.

2269
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:38,380
Maybe you...

2270
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:39,380
I don't think it's a replacement for a smartphone.

2271
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:40,380
That's very clear.

2272
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:44,400
You know, the next big thing can be, but it's
not a replacement for a smartphone.

2273
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,540
We're talking about two completely different
devices, right?

2274
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:48,670
Even though,
I did a video on Instagram.

2275
01:29:48,670 --> 01:29:50,320
The death of the smartphone.

2276
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,390
Got millions of views.

2277
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:52,770
I showed it to Humayun.

2278
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:56,469
But the point of it is that if you are really,
really

2279
01:29:56,469 --> 01:29:58,040
truthful, that's not a smartphone replacement.

2280
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:02,790
No, but sir, eventually, what my opinion here
is, today, we have a mobile phone that does

2281
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:03,790
all our work.

2282
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:05,320
At one time, we needed a calculator.

2283
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:06,320
We needed Walkman.

2284
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,320
Digital cameras.

2285
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:08,320
Multiple things.

2286
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,830
Today, phone is capable to do everything.

2287
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:11,530
166 standalone devices replaced by a smartphone.

2288
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:12,530
So, phone is the hub.

2289
01:30:12,530 --> 01:30:13,610
When we go to a brand's presentation, they
always show their chart.

2290
01:30:13,610 --> 01:30:14,610
This, this, this.

2291
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:15,610
Phone is in the center.

2292
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:16,610
Four things.

2293
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:17,610
Smartwatch, this, this.

2294
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:18,610
This is the thing.

2295
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:19,610
Today, the phone is capable to do everything.

2296
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:23,860
But if you don't have a phone, you forgot
your house, then you are handicapped.

2297
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:26,159
You can't do anything.

2298
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:31,290
So, this still is a hassle that I have to
carry this device with me.

2299
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:33,420
If I don't have this, then I'm nothing.

2300
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:34,420
Right.

2301
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:35,420
I have to charge this.

2302
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:36,420
I have to see this.

2303
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:40,830
The future would be where we can replace this
with something that is in me.

2304
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:41,830
Exactly.

2305
01:30:41,830 --> 01:30:42,830
Or with me altogether.

2306
01:30:42,830 --> 01:30:43,830
Yeah, yeah.

2307
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:46,290
You guys are like into things going inside
your body?

2308
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:47,290
Yeah.

2309
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:48,290
Not at all.

2310
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:49,290
It can be a chip.

2311
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:50,290
No, no.

2312
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:51,290
I would not prefer that.

2313
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:52,290
But, but.

2314
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:53,290
Irshad.

2315
01:30:53,290 --> 01:30:54,290
Put it nicely.

2316
01:30:54,290 --> 01:30:55,290
You know.

2317
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:56,290
Those are not called wearables.

2318
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:57,290
They are called insertables.

2319
01:30:57,290 --> 01:30:58,290
And just by the name itself,
I think it's weird.

2320
01:30:58,290 --> 01:30:59,290
I think.

2321
01:30:59,290 --> 01:31:00,290
I don't want an insertable in me.

2322
01:31:00,290 --> 01:31:01,290
I mean, maybe a smart band that I'm wearing.

2323
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:02,290
Projecting things.

2324
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,290
Or a glass or something.

2325
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:04,290
I mean, eventually something that is with
me.

2326
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:05,290
Flawless.

2327
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:06,290
I mean, without even me having to think about
whether I'm keeping it or not.

2328
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:07,290
It is part of me.

2329
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:08,290
And it will happen.

2330
01:31:08,290 --> 01:31:09,290
Exactly.

2331
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:10,290
I'm with him.

2332
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:11,290
Tech.

2333
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:12,290
We don't have to carry the tech.

2334
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:13,290
In this, I have a challenge.

2335
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:14,290
In this, I have a challenge.

2336
01:31:14,290 --> 01:31:16,989
Right now, the biggest problem is that if
I have an image in my mind or if I have some

2337
01:31:16,989 --> 01:31:23,580
information in my mind, if I want to put it
in my mobile, then I just have fingers.

2338
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:27,150
I will have to type with my fingers or I can
speak with my

2339
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:28,150
voice.

2340
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:33,690
I think the next big thing that will come
because I have the same problem with the watch.

2341
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:35,390
I have the same problem with the eyeglasses.

2342
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:38,449
I think the next big thing that will come
is that it's a little weird to put a chip

2343
01:31:38,449 --> 01:31:39,449
in the brain.

2344
01:31:39,449 --> 01:31:41,130
But there are such technologies that have
come now.

2345
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:42,570
Neuralink has also come.

2346
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:44,219
There are a few more things.

2347
01:31:44,219 --> 01:31:46,010
Which directly interact with our brain.

2348
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:47,010
I'm telling you.

2349
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:48,199
Think of an example.

2350
01:31:48,199 --> 01:31:49,930
We have smart homes now.

2351
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:50,969
Alexa is on.

2352
01:31:50,969 --> 01:31:52,000
Light is connected.

2353
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,390
I will tell it.

2354
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:55,120
Alexa, turn on the light.

2355
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,120
It's a good thing.

2356
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,960
But still, I have to say the best would be
that I just have to think that.

2357
01:31:58,960 --> 01:31:59,960
I think that's the future.

2358
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:00,960
And it will happen.

2359
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,949
It will happen in 10 years.

2360
01:32:02,949 --> 01:32:04,060
In 10 years.

2361
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,810
We are ready for that.

2362
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:06,810
No, no.

2363
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:08,420
It has to happen.

2364
01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:10,199
It has to happen.

2365
01:32:10,199 --> 01:32:13,430
And this is a possibility.

2366
01:32:13,430 --> 01:32:16,160
In medical terms,
I think nanotech and everything will be better.

2367
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:17,260
But I feel something which is connecting.

2368
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:19,800
A part of a tech connecting our brain cells.

2369
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:20,800
I'm not.

2370
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:21,820
I mean, I disagree with that.

2371
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:23,610
Maybe that might be the future.

2372
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:25,920
I think that will be the future.

2373
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,460
The voice will be better.

2374
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:28,460
This, that, everything.

2375
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:29,929
There will be telepathy.
100%.

2376
01:32:29,929 --> 01:32:30,929
That's what I was expecting.

2377
01:32:30,929 --> 01:32:31,929
So think about it.

2378
01:32:31,929 --> 01:32:32,929
I will send you a love letter.

2379
01:32:32,929 --> 01:32:35,960
Not having to carry the tech is what we are
going towards.

2380
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,330
This is going to happen.

2381
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:42,289
And one thing I also feel like the way AI
is coming and right now.

2382
01:32:42,289 --> 01:32:48,710
we are simply using the generative AI to help
our day-to-day tasks.

2383
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:55,210
But in the future, I think maybe if smartphone
companies are able to implement it nicely,

2384
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:57,900
then everyone would have a personal assistant
of their own, tuned to their habits,

2385
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:58,900
their tasks, everything.

2386
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:01,620
And it's possible that in 2024, AI could be
a big buzzword or marketing term for smartphones

2387
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:02,620
to come.

2388
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:05,250
2023 was the buzzword and marketing term for
AI.

2389
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:07,680
2024 will be the result of that.

2390
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:13,070
I think so far, the person who is using AI,
yes, it's great that this person is right.

2391
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:16,320
But in 2024-2025, the job of the person who
is not using AI will go.

2392
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,320
It will go, 100%.

2393
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:22,030
And this means that AI will become a need.

2394
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:23,030
And at this time, it is so powerful, I can
show you a video.

2395
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:24,030
But what exactly are we supposed to catch
up with AI?

2396
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:25,030
I think everything will be replaced.

2397
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:26,030
Every single thing.

2398
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:27,030
What is the thing which we have to catch up?

2399
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:28,140
At least get to know how to use AI.

2400
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:29,140
But why?

2401
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:30,710
You need to be in theâ€¦
But why do we need to walk to AI?

2402
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:32,710
There are peopleâ€¦
So that to you, okay.

2403
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:33,710
You said, but why?

2404
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:34,710
Okay.

2405
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:37,800
If you are using AI, you are able to do what
you do right now.

2406
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,590
You'll be able to do it 10x better, 10x faster.

2407
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:47,750
But if you are not, then like he was saying,
next year, the person who is doing it will

2408
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:51,300
be 10x better and 10x faster than you and
you'll be left way behind.

2409
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:53,080
But what exactly are we looking at?

2410
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,340
I'll show you one thing.

2411
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:57,639
It's a tool that can be usedâ€¦
No, see, that's the whole point is that if

2412
01:33:57,639 --> 01:33:58,770
you start
saying, which tool?

2413
01:33:58,770 --> 01:34:01,490
You lookâ€¦
See, this thing is not going out only to us,

2414
01:34:01,490 --> 01:34:02,490
content
creators out here.

2415
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:04,550
It's going out to the rest of the world.

2416
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:05,709
Here, many different people will come from
different professions.

2417
01:34:05,709 --> 01:34:06,840
The point is not which.

2418
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:09,550
The point is, what do you do and which AI
is applicable to you?

2419
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:17,020
When you wake up in the morning and you go
to sleep at night, you do 7-8 core tasks every

2420
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:18,020
day, right?

2421
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:22,550
Out of those 7-8 core tasks, how many can
now help with AI?

2422
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:23,550
Right?

2423
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:24,550
Okay.

2424
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:27,860
From imagination to your thinking to your
scripting to coming up with an idea.

2425
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:31,270
But like I said, that scripting part is like
it's someâ€¦

2426
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:37,630
A computer is generating that idea for you.

2427
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:39,469
I'm not saying it's perfect right now.

2428
01:34:39,469 --> 01:34:40,520
But it's not perfect.

2429
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:41,830
But that's not the point.

2430
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:42,880
Computers are generating ideas.

2431
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:43,880
How is it doing?

2432
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:46,489
Large language models, basically they are
trained to think like humans.

2433
01:34:46,489 --> 01:34:51,340
So, the way we have got education, the computers
have been trained, they have been given large

2434
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:52,340
data set.

2435
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:56,200
But do you think that the time will takeâ€¦
Let me tell you an interesting thing.

2436
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,020
It will be clear to you.

2437
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:02,010
When humans heard about fridge for the first
time, all the industries thought, make a fridge.

2438
01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:03,060
There is money in it.

2439
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:04,320
It will be in everyone's house.

2440
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,850
The one who earned the most money was the
one who had cold beverages.

2441
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:08,850
Coca-Cola, Maza.

2442
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:11,719
The one who used that fridge, cooled it down
and put it

2443
01:35:11,719 --> 01:35:13,650
back in its place.

2444
01:35:13,650 --> 01:35:15,489
So, AI is that thing.

2445
01:35:15,489 --> 01:35:17,040
AI is a fridge.

2446
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:21,679
The one who will use AI to make tools, that
will work.

2447
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:24,720
The second part, which is a layer up, that
AI needs a lot

2448
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:25,720
of data.

2449
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,270
So, I am telling you, the biggest companies
in the future,

2450
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:31,060
will be more rich, will have more data, and
crazy things

2451
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:32,100
will come out.

2452
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:34,560
This is a reality which we should understand.

2453
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,500
Even we don't know what AI is going to be.

2454
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:40,410
We can only talk, but AI is that fridge, from
which we

2455
01:35:40,410 --> 01:35:42,590
don't know what by-product is going to come
out.

2456
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:43,590
This is a fact.

2457
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:46,480
Now, will you keep a cake or a drink in that
fridge, or a

2458
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:47,480
healthy salad?

2459
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,480
That is on you.

2460
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,480
Or maybe beer.

2461
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:52,320
According to me,
AI will change the entire content industry.

2462
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,699
We won't have to make videos.

2463
01:35:53,699 --> 01:35:55,940
And it is possible,
I will show you one video.

2464
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:56,940
And,
This video.

2465
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:57,940
This is,
100% AI.

2466
01:35:57,940 --> 01:35:58,940
Pixels.

2467
01:35:58,940 --> 01:35:59,940
This is not me.

2468
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:02,090
Neither is it my voice,
nor is it my video,

2469
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,170
nor have I written the script.

2470
01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:07,460
All these things are AI, and it is possible
right now.

2471
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:11,270
And, I am telling you, right now,
I just have to input my face into a software,

2472
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:13,310
and it will make a video for me.

2473
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:15,060
I have a friend, Varun Maya.

2474
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:18,450
He has an AI page, and 70% of the videos are
AI.

2475
01:36:18,450 --> 01:36:20,510
And people don't even know.

2476
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:23,460
People don't even know that he is talking
about AI.

2477
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:26,980
The voice is also mapped, the person is also
mapped.

2478
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:33,540
I am telling you, if this is happening right
now, 100 years from now, what will happen

2479
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:34,600
after 5 years?

2480
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:37,090
What is the end game of this?

2481
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:38,119
What will happen after this?

2482
01:36:38,119 --> 01:36:39,360
What are we supposed to do?

2483
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,310
If you don't have to do anything.

2484
01:36:41,310 --> 01:36:43,510
Yeah, what are we supposed to do?

2485
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:45,070
But sir, raw conversations won't survive like
this.

2486
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:46,070
This is not possible.

2487
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:47,070
Point of view.

2488
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:48,070
Okay.

2489
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:49,070
Now, AI is trained on large data sets.

2490
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:50,070
They don't have emotions.

2491
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:51,070
One second.

2492
01:36:51,070 --> 01:36:52,070
Intelligence.

2493
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:53,070
There is no emotional intelligence.

2494
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:54,070
Creativity, emotional intelligence, that humans,
and they bring perspectives.

2495
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:55,070
Like, what we are discussing right now, everyone
has a different perspective.

2496
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:56,840
AI, it has been trained on large data.

2497
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:57,840
It is a data set.

2498
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:58,840
There are no emotions.

2499
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,989
And most of our decisions, which we make,
are emotionally done.

2500
01:37:00,989 --> 01:37:02,040
At least 30, 40, 50%.

2501
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:05,480
But you can bring a lot of that emotion with
the prompts that you choose.

2502
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:09,210
So now, when we are talking about video, when
we pick it up, the emotion that we feel, that

2503
01:37:09,210 --> 01:37:10,210
AI can never give.

2504
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:11,210
That's why your personal point of view will
always be important.

2505
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:12,210
I think AI, so just I got to know yesterday,
there is an AI

2506
01:37:12,210 --> 01:37:13,210
named Delpy.

2507
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:15,600
So what it does is, it analyzes all your Twitter,
all your Facebook ID, whatever the data, you

2508
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,630
put on, in your mind.

2509
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:22,350
Because the same thing, whatever you have
said so far, personally.

2510
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:25,810
In your point of view, it analyzes everything
and it is available 24x7.

2511
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:29,639
It replies to the comments or it replies to
the tweet of

2512
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:32,880
our audience in such a way that we used to
do that.

2513
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,929
You know Arun, you can give a prompt saying
that if we give this phone to Arun Prabhu

2514
01:37:36,929 --> 01:37:39,790
Desai, what would be his first
six emotional reactions?

2515
01:37:39,790 --> 01:37:40,790
Exactly.

2516
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:43,530
And you will be very surprised it will be
the same six.

2517
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:44,679
So I can quiz you at that time.

2518
01:37:44,679 --> 01:37:45,679
Okay.

2519
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:48,820
I will ask you six questions from your AI
generative model then I will ask you, five

2520
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:50,370
of them will be the same thing.

2521
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:54,449
Let me tell you, this again, in fact, goes
to prove my

2522
01:37:54,449 --> 01:37:55,449
point.

2523
01:37:55,449 --> 01:37:58,260
What you put on social media, on Twitter,
is it what you

2524
01:37:58,260 --> 01:37:59,260
are?

2525
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:03,330
You put your, what you want others to see
about you.

2526
01:38:03,330 --> 01:38:04,330
Okay.

2527
01:38:04,330 --> 01:38:05,360
Not you in particular.

2528
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,300
You are talking about that only.

2529
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:08,300
Exactly.

2530
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:09,570
You will put AI outside only.

2531
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:11,190
Most of the time online.

2532
01:38:11,190 --> 01:38:12,520
You will put AI outside.

2533
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:15,890
But see, like I said, the data is still being
collected.

2534
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:16,890
Yes.

2535
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:20,880
And it is going to collect for another five,
so I think it

2536
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:21,880
will get perfect.

2537
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:22,880
Another five years.

2538
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:23,880
No, no, no.

2539
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:24,880
Not at all.

2540
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,260
It's like,
I would give an example, that AI is like a

2541
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:27,260
child.

2542
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:28,260
Whatever you teach that child, it will learn.

2543
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:29,260
Exactly.

2544
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:30,500
And you teach it that if someone abuses you,
you should get angry.

2545
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:31,810
Or if this happens, you should do this.

2546
01:38:31,810 --> 01:38:34,420
Like we teach a child to walk, to get angry,
to eat this,

2547
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:35,530
not to eat this.

2548
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:37,640
You can teach the same thing to AI.

2549
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:40,810
It takes ten years to teach to a child, and
five minutes to teach to AI.

2550
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:44,929
You scan a PDF of the whole book and send
it to it, to read it and deliver it to me.

2551
01:38:44,929 --> 01:38:45,929
And that book learns it.

2552
01:38:45,929 --> 01:38:49,650
And you give that photography book to the
AI chart board, and that photography will

2553
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:50,650
learn it.

2554
01:38:50,650 --> 01:38:53,550
You tell it to generate a photo, it will do
it.

2555
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:59,929
So if we, basically what AI is, whatever data
you feed it,

2556
01:38:59,929 --> 01:39:00,929
it does it.

2557
01:39:00,929 --> 01:39:03,700
You cannot feed emotions.

2558
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:04,700
I am saying that too.

2559
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:05,989
Its emotions are different.

2560
01:39:05,989 --> 01:39:07,050
Yours are different.

2561
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:08,110
Mine are different.

2562
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:10,810
Because that has come from how we have been
brought up.

2563
01:39:10,810 --> 01:39:15,710
Our experiences as a whole, that the people
who are sitting now, mine, every person sitting

2564
01:39:15,710 --> 01:39:17,909
here today, my thought process is different.

2565
01:39:17,909 --> 01:39:19,100
You thinking about everyone else is different.

2566
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:20,100
It cannot be the same.

2567
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:21,599
It is with the individual.

2568
01:39:21,599 --> 01:39:23,860
And you cannot teach that to AI.

2569
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:28,679
But Arun, your question, you are seeing this,
you are now putting two different things together.

2570
01:39:28,679 --> 01:39:31,400
Your personal life and the life that you have
outside.

2571
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:32,400
We were talking about can we make a video.

2572
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,400
No, I was talking about emotions.

2573
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:34,830
Can you make a video that is completely trained,
like he is speaking, completely trained on

2574
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:37,750
every single thing you have ever output to
the world.

2575
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:40,989
Not personal, not what you are thinking of
us right now.

2576
01:39:40,989 --> 01:39:45,489
Whatever you have shown your personality outward
to the public till date, that can be trained.

2577
01:39:45,489 --> 01:39:49,260
I am giving you this guarantee that if you
will say after

2578
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:52,010
that training that Arun is sitting here and
we have asked your training six questions.

2579
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:53,409
What would be your six emotional reactions
for the public?

2580
01:39:53,409 --> 01:39:54,409
They will be pretty accurate.

2581
01:39:54,409 --> 01:39:56,659
Then my question is do you have to promote
such a thing?

2582
01:39:56,659 --> 01:40:00,070
No, it is not about what we are promoting
or not.

2583
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:01,159
It is going to be there.

2584
01:40:01,159 --> 01:40:04,130
See, he said like about the AI tool, but if
this is the

2585
01:40:04,130 --> 01:40:06,940
thing, like if it can generate the emotion
or it can

2586
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:08,670
replicate what you are outward persona.

2587
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:09,670
Personality, your personality.

2588
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:12,590
There is a big difference between generating
emotion and outward persona.

2589
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:14,400
How can it have that emotional intelligence?

2590
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,400
It might take.

2591
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,400
The emotional connect might take some time.

2592
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,400
Maybe it takes.

2593
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,400
But who is going to get emotional intelligence?

2594
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:19,400
It might take some time.

2595
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,400
Okay.

2596
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:21,400
Okay.

2597
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:22,400
See, how do you get emotional intelligence
from outside?

2598
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,699
What is important is what you are going to
get emotional intelligence from?

2599
01:40:25,699 --> 01:40:30,280
You might get emotional intelligence from
How are you going to feed your emotional intelligence,

2600
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:33,080
which you have built
over the last 20-30 years with experience?

2601
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:36,400
Even with the AIâ€¦
There is a whole field called psychiatry,

2602
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,400
right?

2603
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:40,350
That is
also part of AI, right?

2604
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:42,690
And what you are talking about, that is our
formative

2605
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:44,580
years, my 20-30 years as a human being.

2606
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:48,020
But that formative years is also part of psychiatry.

2607
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:52,460
This
is a very, very dense topic to get into.

2608
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:53,460
Yeah, okay.

2609
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:57,820
Let's leave it atâ€¦
See, I like the generative AI, whatever we

2610
01:40:57,820 --> 01:41:02,830
are using at the camera processing and all
thoseâ€¦

2611
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:04,110
That is fine, that is harmless.

2612
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:05,270
But I am like thinking about what will beâ€¦
If you unlock this thingâ€¦

2613
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:06,540
Everyone is worried about it.

2614
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:07,550
It's just not you.

2615
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:08,550
Everyone
is worried.

2616
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:10,929
Shloka is shown as just a deep fake, very
simple, straight forward.

2617
01:41:10,929 --> 01:41:13,530
I have shown it to you already.

2618
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:15,520
What aboutâ€¦
I have seen it somewhere else.

2619
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:19,270
But whatever is in the pastâ€¦ And to
talk about just theâ€¦ To do the deep

2620
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:20,650
fake that he showed right now.

2621
01:41:20,650 --> 01:41:21,710
Actually, what a deep fake.

2622
01:41:21,710 --> 01:41:25,730
It's like I have fed all the information in
my body language, where I move my hand like

2623
01:41:25,730 --> 01:41:27,510
this, move like that, give expressions like
this.

2624
01:41:27,510 --> 01:41:31,480
So, I fed all the information and in a deep
fake, the face changes.

2625
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,480
No, no.

2626
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,920
This is my wholeâ€¦ For instance, there
is a legal case of Bruce Willis.

2627
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:37,809
There was an advertisement of a Russian Vodka
of Bruce Willis.

2628
01:41:37,809 --> 01:41:38,930
You can all see it online.

2629
01:41:38,930 --> 01:41:40,140
He never went to Russia.

2630
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:42,290
He never shot for it.

2631
01:41:42,290 --> 01:41:43,290
His thing.

2632
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:47,030
Approximately 1000 hours of video was actually
fed in.

2633
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:49,610
That he has a tick here.

2634
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:52,630
When he says this word, his eye

2635
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:53,920
moves like this.

2636
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:56,500
The whole thing was fed in.

2637
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:00,650
And the whole ad deep fake,
they have never paid him for it.

2638
01:42:00,650 --> 01:42:01,650
Nothing.

2639
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:02,650
It happened in Russia.

2640
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:03,650
Very dense legal thing.

2641
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:04,650
So, that isâ€¦ And you know, there are
now contracts that are being given to people

2642
01:42:04,650 --> 01:42:05,650
in Hollywood.

2643
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:06,810
So, this whole thing that is comingâ€¦
In every which way, AI is coming faster than

2644
01:42:06,810 --> 01:42:07,810
you can respond to it.

2645
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:08,810
AI will take our job.

2646
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:09,810
I have full confidence.

2647
01:42:09,810 --> 01:42:13,440
Like, either it will be us who do it or it
would be someone else.

2648
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,869
I think it's like saying that which website
will be popular

2649
01:42:15,869 --> 01:42:16,869
on the internet.

2650
01:42:16,869 --> 01:42:18,090
Internet is the thing that is going on.

2651
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:19,090
So, AI is the
framework.

2652
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:21,290
Now, which website, which prompt, whichâ€¦
That is not the point.

2653
01:42:21,290 --> 01:42:22,590
Because new ones will keep coming.

2654
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:23,890
New ones come every 2 weeks.

2655
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:25,820
So, it's like the framework you have to learn.

2656
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:28,380
By prompting, I mean you learn to tell AI.

2657
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:30,400
Learn to talk to
AI.

2658
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:34,030
Or feed AI what you want it to do.

2659
01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:35,800
A lot of people have a problem with that.

2660
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:38,230
A lot of people are in English right now.

2661
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:39,230
Prompt engineering.

2662
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:40,230
How to get a job.

2663
01:42:40,230 --> 01:42:41,230
Exactly.

2664
01:42:41,230 --> 01:42:42,650
There areâ€¦ I have seen and I have read
about it.

2665
01:42:42,650 --> 01:42:46,010
There are some people who put up an e-book
with brilliant chat GPT prompts.

2666
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:47,930
And they have been making millions of dollars.

2667
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:50,800
Just by telling and teaching people how to
use AI in a better way.

2668
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:54,000
If you know your prompts right, you can get
really good results.

2669
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Yes.

2670
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Sir, give it to me.

2671
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,619
Give me the link.

2672
01:42:57,619 --> 01:42:58,970
Sir, I don't have it.

2673
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:00,900
Everyone thought that the lower level jobs,
AI will finish first.

2674
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:01,900
But the opposite happened.

2675
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:02,900
Creativity finished first.

2676
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:03,900
It's shocking.

2677
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:04,900
I spoke about this that day at that event.

2678
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:05,900
It's so shocking.

2679
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:06,900
And really, we are at the red spot right now.

2680
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:08,440
There is a lot of investment in the lowest
level.

2681
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:10,840
Because in that, you needâ€¦
In the everyday mundane jobs, you need robotics

2682
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:11,840
to actually close that action.

2683
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:14,070
If you are a blue collar worker, if you are
makingâ€¦

2684
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:15,280
There is a point.

2685
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:16,310
There is a point.

2686
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:18,230
Did you see Tesla's new robot video?

2687
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:19,230
It is crazy.

2688
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:20,230
It is like an actual human.

2689
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:21,230
That balance panel.

2690
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:22,920
There is a coffee shop in Dubai.

2691
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:23,920
Something about that.

2692
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,110
There is a coffee shop in Dubai.

2693
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:26,150
In Dubai festival city.

2694
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:27,980
And it is not there since today.

2695
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:30,320
It has been there for the past 2-3 years.

2696
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:31,949
There is zero staff.

2697
01:43:31,949 --> 01:43:33,980
Do you know what happens there?

2698
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:34,980
You go.

2699
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:39,400
It's a huge platform.

2700
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:45,909
It's such a big platform.

2701
01:43:45,909 --> 01:43:48,580
There is seating on the edges.

2702
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:51,170
You go and sit on the stool.

2703
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:52,940
There is an iPad in front.

2704
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:53,940
There is a menu.

2705
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:54,940
You order.

2706
01:43:54,940 --> 01:43:55,940
You are ordering.

2707
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:56,940
You pay.

2708
01:43:56,940 --> 01:43:57,940
In front, there is a barista.

2709
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,469
He is a robotic arm.

2710
01:43:59,469 --> 01:44:00,960
You can see the robotic arm in front.

2711
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:01,960
He opened it.

2712
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:02,960
He poured milk.

2713
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,330
He is doing all the human actions in the robotic
arm.

2714
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:06,330
He will do everything.

2715
01:44:06,330 --> 01:44:08,550
He placed his order on the tray in front.

2716
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:10,360
He knows that he has come to you.

2717
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:11,360
You drank coffee.

2718
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:12,360
You left.

2719
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:13,670
There is no one in the entire shop.

2720
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:14,670
There is a cashier.

2721
01:44:14,670 --> 01:44:17,110
For that matter, there is not a single person.

2722
01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:18,389
Soâ€¦ Gaurav, look at its investment.

2723
01:44:18,389 --> 01:44:19,460
Robotic arm and other things.

2724
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:20,739
But it is one time investment.

2725
01:44:20,739 --> 01:44:22,670
Generating AI is only software building on
more software.

2726
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:23,739
Sir, it is very expensive.

2727
01:44:23,739 --> 01:44:25,520
Sir, it is needed for that too.

2728
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,460
But it is done for easy rounds.

2729
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:29,659
But it is easy.

2730
01:44:29,659 --> 01:44:30,800
This is a fact.

2731
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:31,800
Yes.

2732
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:32,800
Okay.

2733
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,739
But an interesting thing that we can take
out for the viewers.

2734
01:44:34,739 --> 01:44:38,689
What we are talking about is for someone to
start content creation now.

2735
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:41,430
You think you don't even need a studio.

2736
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:42,869
You sit in a chair at home.

2737
01:44:42,869 --> 01:44:44,190
AI has made the studio.

2738
01:44:44,190 --> 01:44:45,190
There is a camera.

2739
01:44:45,190 --> 01:44:46,190
There is less light.

2740
01:44:46,190 --> 01:44:47,610
AI has enhanced the light.

2741
01:44:47,610 --> 01:44:48,949
There is noise in the voice.

2742
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:50,460
AI has removed that.

2743
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:54,239
So, for someone to start the content creation
journey today.

2744
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:56,130
Using all the AI tools.

2745
01:44:56,130 --> 01:44:58,100
Yeah, even I support that kind of AI.

2746
01:44:58,100 --> 01:44:59,100
With one clickâ€¦
Listen.

2747
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:01,520
So, with one clickâ€¦
With one click, you have made captions.

2748
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:03,060
With one click, your script is ready.

2749
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:04,060
Translations.

2750
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:05,060
Everything.

2751
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:06,060
So, I think the struggle that we did.

2752
01:45:06,060 --> 01:45:07,060
Anyone can be a creator.

2753
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:08,060
5 years, 7 years ago.

2754
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:09,060
AI will be dubbed.

2755
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:10,060
That struggle has reduced today.

2756
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:12,929
If you are smart enough how to use AI.

2757
01:45:12,929 --> 01:45:15,159
This could be a good thing.

2758
01:45:15,159 --> 01:45:16,659
One more thing is clear.

2759
01:45:16,659 --> 01:45:17,910
AI is the next big thing.

2760
01:45:17,910 --> 01:45:19,350
We have talked so much about this.

2761
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:21,239
I have said this from the beginning.

2762
01:45:21,239 --> 01:45:22,570
Always going to be AI.

2763
01:45:22,570 --> 01:45:25,010
But AI will be the biggest thing.

2764
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:26,010
It will be smart.

2765
01:45:26,010 --> 01:45:27,010
Okay, guys.

2766
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:28,409
We have to take a break for 2 minutes.

2767
01:45:28,409 --> 01:45:29,409
2 minutes.

2768
01:45:29,409 --> 01:45:30,860
So, it was a deep conversation actually.

2769
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:33,659
So, let's come back to a little, you know,
rooted topic.

2770
01:45:33,659 --> 01:45:34,659
Smartphones.

2771
01:45:34,659 --> 01:45:35,659
Right.

2772
01:45:35,659 --> 01:45:37,090
Something that we covered day in and day out.

2773
01:45:37,090 --> 01:45:38,960
You know, we ran on that.

2774
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,210
So, how is 2023?

2775
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:41,210
How is 2024 looking?

2776
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:42,580
Have the prices become aggressive?

2777
01:45:42,580 --> 01:45:44,730
Are we going back to pre-COVID days?

2778
01:45:44,730 --> 01:45:47,810
When, you know, shocking prices from POCO
F1 were there.

2779
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:49,650
Are we going back to that?

2780
01:45:49,650 --> 01:45:51,239
That is not going to happen.

2781
01:45:51,239 --> 01:45:53,080
Not going to happen?

2782
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,900
But it seems like iQOO.

2783
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:55,900
With 12.

2784
01:45:55,900 --> 01:45:58,909
The new 7 Pro that came.

2785
01:45:58,909 --> 01:45:59,909
It was very creative.

2786
01:45:59,909 --> 01:46:01,210
With iQOO 12, I feel again.

2787
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:04,010
That that part of it is starting to come again.

2788
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:05,870
Because if someone takes a brand lead.

2789
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:07,340
Others have to follow.

2790
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:10,290
And I think with hygiene coming into technology.

2791
01:46:10,290 --> 01:46:12,449
Where everything is more or less becoming.

2792
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:13,719
You know, very easy to put together.

2793
01:46:13,719 --> 01:46:16,210
Or wow factors of smartphones have become
lesser and lesser.

2794
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:17,869
I think price aggression will come back.

2795
01:46:17,869 --> 01:46:19,300
Yeah, because I feel the same.

2796
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:20,750
Because, first of all, smartphone adoption
has plateaued.

2797
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:22,300
I mean, there is no growth in the market.

2798
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:24,210
The 153 million peak that we took in 2019.

2799
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:26,150
That plateaued to like below that.

2800
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:28,370
And there has to be some sort of impetus.

2801
01:46:28,370 --> 01:46:29,370
To rise, right?

2802
01:46:29,370 --> 01:46:30,370
For the market.

2803
01:46:30,370 --> 01:46:31,670
Basically, you can never play on price.

2804
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:32,750
In a longer run.

2805
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:34,980
You can never do it in any business.

2806
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:37,580
If you think that I will become aggressive
in price.

2807
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:38,929
And I will make the market.

2808
01:46:38,929 --> 01:46:40,030
You can't make it.

2809
01:46:40,030 --> 01:46:41,400
You will make it today.

2810
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:43,050
But it won't be long lasting.

2811
01:46:43,050 --> 01:46:44,050
Biggest learning, Xiaomi.

2812
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:45,239
Showed how aggressive it is.

2813
01:46:45,239 --> 01:46:47,440
No one buys a Xiaomi phone for 25,000.

2814
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:48,440
It doesn't sell.

2815
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:50,560
No one buys a Xiaomi phone for 70,000.

2816
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:53,100
But you can be aggressive at each category,
right?

2817
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:54,100
No, no.

2818
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:55,140
But I am just saying that.

2819
01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:57,860
If we are aggressive at iQOO 12.

2820
01:46:57,860 --> 01:46:59,699
iQOO 12 is good.

2821
01:46:59,699 --> 01:47:01,230
But the problem is.

2822
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:04,000
iQOO 12 is selling a phone for 50,000 today.

2823
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,580
Let's say they are very little margins.

2824
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:07,719
It is possible that they can take a loss.

2825
01:47:07,719 --> 01:47:08,719
For some duration.

2826
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:09,800
Just to establish themselves.

2827
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:10,800
But they can't repeat it for 5 years now.

2828
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:11,800
Okay.

2829
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:12,800
So, the price game can never run long.

2830
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:13,800
You can't wait for.

2831
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:14,800
Here I have a point.

2832
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:15,800
I am not talking about.

2833
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:16,800
Undercutting.

2834
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:17,800
Or having less price.

2835
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:18,800
Selling at a loss.

2836
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:19,800
I don't think so.

2837
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:20,800
The thing is.

2838
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:21,800
All the issues.

2839
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:22,800
Because of which.

2840
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:23,800
The smartphone's price has had rocketed.

2841
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:24,800
They are gone.

2842
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,800
Those issues are resolved.

2843
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:26,800
But they were removed long back.

2844
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:27,800
No, no.

2845
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:28,800
It was till mid-2022.

2846
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:29,800
It was oversupplied.

2847
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:30,800
Yes.

2848
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:31,800
Not oversupply.

2849
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:32,800
A lot of stock was left.

2850
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:33,800
And this particular time.

2851
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:34,800
They have removed it.

2852
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:35,800
All the stock.

2853
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:36,800
So, a new stock will come.

2854
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:37,800
But.

2855
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,800
The issues.

2856
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:39,800
Or.

2857
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:40,800
Earlier they used to demand more from outside.

2858
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:41,800
Now India is manufacturing.

2859
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:42,800
A lot of things which were there earlier.

2860
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:43,800
I think in the days of 2019.

2861
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:44,800
We will see such days.

2862
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,800
Without pricing.

2863
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:46,800
Yes.

2864
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:47,800
Without pricing.

2865
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:48,800
It's not one brand who will do it.

2866
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:49,800
Correct.

2867
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:50,800
I will tell you honestly.

2868
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:51,800
Just think through.

2869
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:52,800
Give a basic thought.

2870
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:53,800
We used to see a phone for 10,000 or 15,000.

2871
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:54,800
4 years back.

2872
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:55,800
And we used to think.

2873
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:56,800
We are getting so much in that phone.

2874
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,800
Don't know why.

2875
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:58,800
As customers.

2876
01:47:58,800 --> 01:47:59,800
And even as ourselves.

2877
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:00,800
Whenever we.

2878
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:01,800
The standard rate of inflation.

2879
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:02,800
We also think.

2880
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:03,800
How can a mobile phone be for 10,000 or 15,000.

2881
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:05,390
We always want it to be for 10,000.

2882
01:48:05,390 --> 01:48:06,390
How can we get it?

2883
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:08,400
Inflation is happening in the world.

2884
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:09,429
It is existing.

2885
01:48:09,429 --> 01:48:12,250
What we are getting as an advantage is.

2886
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:14,950
The technology is getting better.

2887
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:16,230
At the same time.

2888
01:48:16,230 --> 01:48:19,080
So, we are getting some things at a lower
price.

2889
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,580
But at the same time.

2890
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:21,580
Price will increase eventually.

2891
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:22,580
Everything is increasing.

2892
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:23,580
Biscuits are increasing.

2893
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:24,580
Water is increasing.

2894
01:48:24,580 --> 01:48:25,580
Everything is increasing.

2895
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:26,580
Inflation is there.

2896
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:27,580
6-7% inflation.

2897
01:48:27,580 --> 01:48:28,580
But technology has always been anti-inflation.

2898
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:29,580
The laptops that used to come.

2899
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:30,580
And the exact laptops.

2900
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:31,580
I am not talking about the same specs.

2901
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:32,580
I am talking that same category.

2902
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:33,580
You are obviously getting it better.

2903
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:34,580
Because production improves.

2904
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:35,580
The overall quality of what you are doing
improves.

2905
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:36,580
Economy of scale kicks in.

2906
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:37,580
I think it's fine.

2907
01:48:37,580 --> 01:48:38,580
The phone for 10,000.

2908
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:39,580
You were getting 625.

2909
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:40,580
Now you are getting G85, G90.

2910
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:41,580
No, no, no.

2911
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:42,580
I am not talking about that.

2912
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:45,119
I am not talking that the price of the same
spec comes

2913
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:46,119
lower.

2914
01:48:46,119 --> 01:48:47,119
I am saying because technology improves.

2915
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:48,119
Becomes better.

2916
01:48:48,119 --> 01:48:49,119
Do remember that.

2917
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:50,119
The amount of hardware that is made.

2918
01:48:50,119 --> 01:48:51,800
You are seeing improvement in the phone.

2919
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:53,830
There is a lot of difference in their manufacturing.

2920
01:48:53,830 --> 01:48:54,889
If you have an OLED TV.

2921
01:48:54,889 --> 01:48:58,260
TV that comes in at a particular price point,
a much better

2922
01:48:58,260 --> 01:48:59,580
one will come at maybe 80% lower a little
later.

2923
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:00,580
Why?

2924
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:01,739
Because production and economy of scale became
better.

2925
01:49:01,739 --> 01:49:04,900
So when you are actually, I am now predicting
that in 2024,

2926
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:09,310
you are going to see a lot of the things that
went wrong in COVID, the oversupply.

2927
01:49:09,310 --> 01:49:10,560
Why did the oversupply come?

2928
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:12,020
They actually have invested far more now to
get things done.

2929
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:14,469
So the actual advantage of that will go to
consumers.

2930
01:49:14,469 --> 01:49:17,119
You will get better products at a lower price
in 2024

2931
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:18,139
without undercutting.

2932
01:49:18,139 --> 01:49:19,949
I'll ask a simple question.

2933
01:49:19,949 --> 01:49:21,920
Tell me what's your answer.

2934
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:23,960
Samsung S24 Ultra is launching in January.

2935
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:28,389
If the world goes from one place to another,
can its price

2936
01:49:28,389 --> 01:49:30,389
be lower than the S23 series?

2937
01:49:30,389 --> 01:49:39,611
But when you talk about the highest flagship,
that is not

2938
01:49:39,611 --> 01:49:40,611
what is happening.

2939
01:49:40,611 --> 01:49:41,611
No, no.

2940
01:49:41,611 --> 01:49:42,611
But I am just saying.

2941
01:49:42,611 --> 01:49:43,920
I mean, when Apple Airpods 3 will come, will
it be cheaper

2942
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:44,920
than Airpods 2?

2943
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:45,920
No, I have a question.

2944
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,050
I have a thing.

2945
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:52,530
Let's say we all are going to agree something
like S23 is a good phone.

2946
01:49:52,530 --> 01:49:54,610
Like this year we got a release.

2947
01:49:54,610 --> 01:49:59,840
Do you think that someone can, I mean, with
the software support and the performance,

2948
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:03,220
I am pretty sure that in 2025, S23 is a good
phone.

2949
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:06,670
So if there is a chance that if that phone
is available in

2950
01:50:06,670 --> 01:50:10,139
a very low price, I think people can buy it,
right?

2951
01:50:10,139 --> 01:50:11,139
Yeah, I mean.

2952
01:50:11,139 --> 01:50:12,139
I mean, technology is that.

2953
01:50:12,139 --> 01:50:13,139
That is fine.

2954
01:50:13,139 --> 01:50:14,139
Fine.

2955
01:50:14,139 --> 01:50:16,530
But all I am saying is, the reason for the
price to go up,

2956
01:50:16,530 --> 01:50:18,270
I mean, the iPhone will start to be made in
India.

2957
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:21,640
But if someone says that iPhone 16 is being
made in India completely, can its price be

2958
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:23,099
lower than the current price of iPhone?

2959
01:50:23,099 --> 01:50:24,989
But both your examples are at the highest
one.

2960
01:50:24,989 --> 01:50:26,700
This is at the highest level, but that is
not really the

2961
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:27,700
topic we are talking about.

2962
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:28,700
Alright, alright, alright.

2963
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:31,230
What we will do is, a mid-range normal phone,
okay, which in the last year, and in the last

2964
01:50:31,230 --> 01:50:33,050
year, it was available
for Rs 25,000.

2965
01:50:33,050 --> 01:50:36,739
Today, you will get a better phone in every
aspect, whether it is display, performance,

2966
01:50:36,739 --> 01:50:37,739
everything.

2967
01:50:37,739 --> 01:50:38,739
You are going to get it for less than Rs 25,000.

2968
01:50:38,739 --> 01:50:40,370
Are you saying that we are not getting better
phones

2969
01:50:40,370 --> 01:50:42,050
because you said that the price is going to
increase.

2970
01:50:42,050 --> 01:50:43,150
The price is increasing.

2971
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:47,199
If you are getting more phone for the same
price, even today.

2972
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:50,670
You will get more phone for less price is
what we are saying.

2973
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:55,570
If the technology is enhanced, then it's obvious.

2974
01:50:55,570 --> 01:50:59,750
If you compare the phone from 3 years ago
with the phone from 3 years ago, then it's

2975
01:50:59,750 --> 01:51:00,750
also enhanced.

2976
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:01,750
No, not that.

2977
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:02,750
We have seen that with time.

2978
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:05,420
In the beginning, there was a fingerprint
scanner in a phone for Rs 50,000.

2979
01:51:05,420 --> 01:51:08,000
Today, you can get it in a phone for Rs 10,000.

2980
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
You know, whatever.

2981
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,350
So, technology always trickles down.

2982
01:51:10,350 --> 01:51:14,590
What brands do is, if they are selling an
expensive item, they will earn all their maximum

2983
01:51:14,590 --> 01:51:17,659
profits, and then they
will introduce a lower tier variant of them.

2984
01:51:17,659 --> 01:51:20,239
I don't understand what both of you are saying.

2985
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:22,000
Are you saying that phones are getting expensive?

2986
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,100
He has something to say.

2987
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:24,860
I would say, I would break it down.

2988
01:51:24,860 --> 01:51:28,619
According to me, the company that was trying
to sell at a low price, it doesn't have a

2989
01:51:28,619 --> 01:51:30,429
profit to experiment and make a new thing.

2990
01:51:30,429 --> 01:51:32,050
That's what you told me.

2991
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:36,920
You can't play for a long time at a price.

2992
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:38,070
I agree.

2993
01:51:38,070 --> 01:51:40,500
You can play by reducing the price.

2994
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:44,300
But the market now is that you can't give
better specs at a lower price.

2995
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:46,389
You have to do higher price, better quality.

2996
01:51:46,389 --> 01:51:48,929
I will give you something that you will immediately
relate

2997
01:51:48,929 --> 01:51:49,929
to.

2998
01:51:49,929 --> 01:51:57,040
The jacket you are wearing now, maybe you
bought this fabric from a Japanese supplier.

2999
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:02,320
Now, the Japanese supplier you have, he has
invested maybe 1 billion dollars to make something

3000
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,310
much better at a lower price.

3001
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:05,310
Much better.

3002
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:06,620
He has invested a lot.

3003
01:52:06,620 --> 01:52:09,450
You will give that advantage to your customer,
right?

3004
01:52:09,450 --> 01:52:15,770
A better product at a lower price because
you are being enabled to do it now.

3005
01:52:15,770 --> 01:52:17,750
First of all, someone should make it.

3006
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:19,170
No one can make it.

3007
01:52:19,170 --> 01:52:22,219
And because we are making it by doing a lot
of research,

3008
01:52:22,219 --> 01:52:23,760
that is one of our incentives.

3009
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:28,880
Because in skins and everything else, we have
invested crores, then we are able to make

3010
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:29,880
it.

3011
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:32,699
Someone else has to make it, he has to invest
crores.

3012
01:52:32,699 --> 01:52:34,290
I am talking about you.

3013
01:52:34,290 --> 01:52:37,480
Your input, this fabric, you import from Japan,
that guy,

3014
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:42,430
that supplier has improved his production
and material and he can now give it to you

3015
01:52:42,430 --> 01:52:43,800
at 10% lesser and it is 10%
better.

3016
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:44,800
Now you will buy the product from him, right?

3017
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,170
But we won't reduce the price, right?

3018
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:47,170
That's the thing.

3019
01:52:47,170 --> 01:52:48,219
Becauseâ€¦ The market will go down.

3020
01:52:48,219 --> 01:52:49,639
The market will go down.

3021
01:52:49,639 --> 01:52:51,420
The customer will not get that advantage.

3022
01:52:51,420 --> 01:52:54,130
We won't introduce that as aâ€¦ We won't
introduce Overlace as a cheap brand.

3023
01:52:54,130 --> 01:52:55,130
No, we are going on a different topic.

3024
01:52:55,130 --> 01:52:56,199
It's not aboutâ€¦
It's not aboutâ€¦

3025
01:52:56,199 --> 01:52:57,199
Let's keep the atmosphere light.

3026
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:58,810
What do you think about bank offers?

3027
01:52:58,810 --> 01:52:59,810
What is your take?

3028
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:01,650
One of the biggest game changers of 2023.

3029
01:53:01,650 --> 01:53:05,610
Not bank offers, the no-cost EMI has been
one of the biggest game changers of 2023.

3030
01:53:05,610 --> 01:53:06,610
But it was there earlier also.

3031
01:53:06,610 --> 01:53:07,719
No, no, now it is true no-cost.

3032
01:53:07,719 --> 01:53:10,219
Earlier it was a very fake one.

3033
01:53:10,219 --> 01:53:13,010
They used to make mistakes in calculations.

3034
01:53:13,010 --> 01:53:14,880
Today a lot of people come to me.

3035
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:19,119
They used to say, you know, tell me in 30,000
rupees.

3036
01:53:19,119 --> 01:53:21,219
Now people's question has changed.

3037
01:53:21,219 --> 01:53:28,940
And they say, you know, at a budget of 3,000
rupees a month, which is the phone to buy?

3038
01:53:28,940 --> 01:53:30,470
So, the psychology of buying is changing.

3039
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:31,820
And that is a huge game changer.

3040
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:32,820
Huge game changer.

3041
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:34,579
That's why iPhones have been sold a lot.

3042
01:53:34,579 --> 01:53:35,579
That's why.

3043
01:53:35,579 --> 01:53:36,590
What an amazing scheme this is.

3044
01:53:36,590 --> 01:53:40,380
No doubt, there will be bank offers, credit
card offers, no-cost offers.

3045
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:44,580
I think all this has given a lot of benefit
to India.

3046
01:53:44,580 --> 01:53:45,580
In general.

3047
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:48,639
But let me throw one more question out.

3048
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:51,730
Because I find it very interesting that when
I get replies back.

3049
01:53:51,730 --> 01:53:54,590
In 2019, iPhone total market share was less
than 1%.

3050
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:56,600
It is approximately now at about 7%.

3051
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:57,600
Massive.

3052
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:01,920
I mean, if you show any other brand that they
have increased 700% in 4 years.

3053
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:02,920
Right?

3054
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:03,920
But where is the growth?

3055
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:06,570
Is it in theâ€¦
Like this year, did the iPhone 15 make this

3056
01:54:06,570 --> 01:54:07,570
growth happen?

3057
01:54:07,570 --> 01:54:10,579
Or is it the iPhone 11 and the 12?

3058
01:54:10,579 --> 01:54:11,579
Always last year.

3059
01:54:11,579 --> 01:54:12,579
Butâ€¦ Is that good for a brand?

3060
01:54:12,579 --> 01:54:13,579
Butâ€¦ Okay.

3061
01:54:13,579 --> 01:54:14,579
So, I will tell you one thing.

3062
01:54:14,579 --> 01:54:18,770
And I think you all will agree on this.

3063
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:25,449
The iPhone which has increased by 1% or 2%
and has now gone up to 5%, 6%, 7%.

3064
01:54:25,449 --> 01:54:26,469
It will increase more.

3065
01:54:26,469 --> 01:54:27,469
Yes.

3066
01:54:27,469 --> 01:54:28,469
It can never decrease.

3067
01:54:28,469 --> 01:54:30,099
I will tell you the reason for that.

3068
01:54:30,099 --> 01:54:31,530
Everyone wanted an iPhone.

3069
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:32,599
Everyone wanted it.

3070
01:54:32,599 --> 01:54:35,440
They were not able to buy it at one time.

3071
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:38,670
Or there was a barrier of starting price which
was very high.

3072
01:54:38,670 --> 01:54:40,810
Should I give a contradiction to this?

3073
01:54:40,810 --> 01:54:42,130
No, listen to me once.

3074
01:54:42,130 --> 01:54:43,449
Why did they want it?

3075
01:54:43,449 --> 01:54:44,600
Because someone else did not have it.

3076
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:45,760
Because it was a good phone.

3077
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,210
iPhone is a good phone.

3078
01:54:47,210 --> 01:54:48,219
I meanâ€¦ iPhone is a good phone.

3079
01:54:48,219 --> 01:54:50,590
There was also a reason that there was an
exclusive thing.

3080
01:54:50,590 --> 01:54:53,690
But sir, we felt that it has sold a lot.

3081
01:54:53,690 --> 01:54:54,690
Listen to me.

3082
01:54:54,690 --> 01:54:58,120
But when you see tier 2, tier 3, that aspiration
is still

3083
01:54:58,120 --> 01:54:59,520
there.

3084
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:00,520
It is still there.

3085
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:01,520
I am saying that it is still there.

3086
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:02,910
People who do not have it still want it.

3087
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:03,910
They want it.

3088
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:05,599
Every year we see that the price of old phones
goes down.

3089
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:07,489
Old phones are still good for another 3-4-5
years.

3090
01:55:07,489 --> 01:55:08,960
The way because the iPhones are made.

3091
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:10,470
And at the same time, people's salaries are
increasing.

3092
01:55:10,470 --> 01:55:11,470
People are changing new jobs.

3093
01:55:11,470 --> 01:55:12,780
Money is coming into the market.

3094
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:16,170
So at the end, they will buy the same thing
which they

3095
01:55:16,170 --> 01:55:17,170
wanted to buy.

3096
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:21,190
So by doing this, more new people are going
to join in this.

3097
01:55:21,190 --> 01:55:24,650
But there is no drastic change in technology
also when it

3098
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:25,650
comes to phones.

3099
01:55:25,650 --> 01:55:27,650
It's just a big thing.

3100
01:55:27,650 --> 01:55:28,659
It doesn't matter.

3101
01:55:28,659 --> 01:55:29,679
See, okay.

3102
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:32,600
I mean the latest ones which have been released.

3103
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:36,610
Today, almost all the phones in the market,
they are good enough phones.

3104
01:55:36,610 --> 01:55:40,100
There was a time when there were bad phones
and good phones.

3105
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:41,100
Okay.

3106
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:43,960
Today, for every phone, if let's say not you
are the

3107
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:46,570
target, someone else is the customer and they
are happy

3108
01:55:46,570 --> 01:55:47,570
with those phones.

3109
01:55:47,570 --> 01:55:48,570
iPhone is also good.

3110
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:49,570
Samsung is also good.

3111
01:55:49,570 --> 01:55:50,570
All these are good phones today.

3112
01:55:50,570 --> 01:55:53,140
So if you come to nitpicking, you will find
15 shortcomings

3113
01:55:53,140 --> 01:55:54,190
in every phone.

3114
01:55:54,190 --> 01:55:55,600
No one is perfect.

3115
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,360
But it's a good phone.

3116
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:58,949
It gives you a good experience.

3117
01:55:58,949 --> 01:56:01,510
And that's the reason people want to buy it.

3118
01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:04,110
Because it's a good phone at the end.

3119
01:56:04,110 --> 01:56:06,380
Samsung is also good for that matter.

3120
01:56:06,380 --> 01:56:08,520
No, iPhone is more affordable now actually.

3121
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,460
That's what I am saying.

3122
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:17,190
So because of it, because of it beingâ€¦
So now let's paint a scenario that the aspiration

3123
01:56:17,190 --> 01:56:18,190
tier 2,

3124
01:56:18,190 --> 01:56:22,659
tier 3 is because you have it, I don't.

3125
01:56:22,659 --> 01:56:23,659
I aspire to it.

3126
01:56:23,659 --> 01:56:25,170
When iPhone will be in the 20% market, what
will be the aspiration?

3127
01:56:25,170 --> 01:56:29,820
Sir, there is such a big market in the US,
it is still sold.

3128
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:31,139
Because the phone is good.

3129
01:56:31,139 --> 01:56:33,119
But sir, our population is very big.

3130
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:35,420
Dubai, Dubai, there is no carrier in Dubai.

3131
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:37,280
Take it, it is sold there too.

3132
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,139
Basically, let me tell you one thing.

3133
01:56:39,139 --> 01:56:40,690
Let's say something is good, genuinely good.

3134
01:56:40,690 --> 01:56:42,190
If its market share is 80%, then you will
not stop buying

3135
01:56:42,190 --> 01:56:43,190
it.

3136
01:56:43,190 --> 01:56:45,989
Thinking that its market share is 80%, that's
why you will stop buying it.

3137
01:56:45,989 --> 01:56:47,520
No, but its aspiration decreases.

3138
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,040
No, but still you will.

3139
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:50,380
But the population is very big.

3140
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:51,380
No, no, no.

3141
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:54,090
I am notâ€¦
Listen, if in India, Apple has got 20%, then

3142
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:55,090
they will be
in trouble.

3143
01:56:55,090 --> 01:56:56,809
Sir, it will happen.

3144
01:56:56,809 --> 01:56:57,809
It will happen.

3145
01:56:57,809 --> 01:56:58,809
You will get 20% soon.

3146
01:56:58,809 --> 01:57:00,719
You won't get it today, you will get it after
2 years.

3147
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:05,010
But I agree to what he said.

3148
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:10,489
There was a time when people used to see Apple
as a very

3149
01:57:10,489 --> 01:57:11,489
premium product.

3150
01:57:11,489 --> 01:57:13,289
We wanted to acquire it.

3151
01:57:13,289 --> 01:57:14,790
But now the thing is that, let's say, everyone
has it.

3152
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:16,810
But everyone has the access to buy the phone.

3153
01:57:16,810 --> 01:57:18,950
So I feel the market is more like, you know,
people that have a mid-range phone.

3154
01:57:18,950 --> 01:57:21,320
They are the ones who are going to look up
to all these flagship phones.

3155
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:25,260
I actually did a reel on this exact emotion,
where earlier, 5 years back, if you bought

3156
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:28,550
an iPhone or if you are using it, everyone
is looking at you.

3157
01:57:28,550 --> 01:57:29,830
And thenâ€¦
It was quite funny, I saw it.

3158
01:57:29,830 --> 01:57:31,530
But the point is, that is actually happening.

3159
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:34,409
But still, I also agree that the iPhone sales
will increase.

3160
01:57:34,409 --> 01:57:36,369
No, I am not saying that it will increase.

3161
01:57:36,369 --> 01:57:38,810
I am saying that it will increase by 10-15%.

3162
01:57:38,810 --> 01:57:43,710
I said that if there is a good product in
the market, and we all use it, will I stop

3163
01:57:43,710 --> 01:57:46,800
using it just becauseâ€¦
But its wow factor will decrease.

3164
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,030
Sir, it doesn't matter.

3165
01:57:48,030 --> 01:57:50,520
The wow factor of the phone is never less.

3166
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:51,720
I feelâ€¦
We made it.

3167
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:52,930
No, sir, we made it.

3168
01:57:52,930 --> 01:57:57,860
They want to say something for the longest
time.

3169
01:57:57,860 --> 01:58:02,730
One of the benefits of the iPhone is that,
let's say we are using any iPhone for 2 years,

3170
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:07,820
its resale value is much better compared to
any other Android phone.

3171
01:58:07,820 --> 01:58:11,659
And in the Indian market, that is very important.

3172
01:58:11,659 --> 01:58:12,730
That is very important.

3173
01:58:12,730 --> 01:58:15,130
But why is it so?

3174
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:17,849
For the same aspirational reason, becauseâ€¦
Okay, what you can afford the other person.

3175
01:58:17,849 --> 01:58:22,699
Because till date, as sir has mentioned, buying
an iPhone was an aspiration for many people.

3176
01:58:22,699 --> 01:58:27,989
So, there is a scarcity in the market of seeing
an iPhone.

3177
01:58:27,989 --> 01:58:29,960
Now everyone is using the iPhone.

3178
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:35,390
Do you see 2024 or 2025, iPhone will have
the same resale value as before?

3179
01:58:35,390 --> 01:58:38,250
There is a huge room for growth, I think.

3180
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:40,460
There is a huge business now, which is refurbished.

3181
01:58:40,460 --> 01:58:43,360
And already in the refurbished market, iPhone's
prices have dramatically dropped.

3182
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:47,739
Second thing, in this Diwali, there is also,
you know,

3183
01:58:47,739 --> 01:58:48,920
there is all these analysts that work now.

3184
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:53,469
A very interesting thing came out through
these analysts, in corporate, the most wow

3185
01:58:53,469 --> 01:58:55,800
thing to give to somebody, big corporates,
like someone is working with a huge company,

3186
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:58,219
they are sending 100 iPhones as gifts.

3187
01:58:58,219 --> 01:59:00,969
Lowest number of iPhones were sent this year.

3188
01:59:00,969 --> 01:59:02,510
Do you know what replaced it?

3189
01:59:02,510 --> 01:59:03,510
Folding phones.

3190
01:59:03,510 --> 01:59:05,380
Because the wow factor of folding phones was
very low.

3191
01:59:05,380 --> 01:59:07,050
And tomorrow, Apple will get a fold.

3192
01:59:07,050 --> 01:59:08,050
No, no.

3193
01:59:08,050 --> 01:59:10,760
It will be worth 4 lakhs and people will buy
it again.

3194
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:13,480
What happened now, 2023, there was a shift
to the wow factor of folding phones.

3195
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:16,480
Alright, one question, now we are talking
about iPhone's sales.

3196
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:20,010
In India, how many people buy iPhones for
the software, hardware optimizations, the,

3197
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:21,929
you know, really good looks and good camera?

3198
01:59:21,929 --> 01:59:25,400
And how many of them buy just because it has
that brand value?

3199
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:27,800
It is because there is an iPhone, that's why.

3200
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:29,659
So what will beâ€¦
Should I answer?

3201
01:59:29,659 --> 01:59:30,659
Yes.

3202
01:59:30,659 --> 01:59:35,330
There are a lot of people who change their
new iPhone on day one.

3203
01:59:35,330 --> 01:59:37,079
There are a lot of such people.

3204
01:59:37,079 --> 01:59:39,210
There are a lot of people who will change
their iPhone after 3-4 years.

3205
01:59:39,210 --> 01:59:41,790
But there are a lot of people who don't care.

3206
01:59:41,790 --> 01:59:42,940
What is the percentage?

3207
01:59:42,940 --> 01:59:43,940
Listen, listen.

3208
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:48,880
There are a lot of people who don't care if
the iPhone is worth 2 lakhs, 3 lakhs or 5

3209
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:49,880
lakhs.

3210
01:59:49,880 --> 01:59:50,880
They don't care.

3211
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,040
They are using the iPhone and they will buy
it.

3212
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:54,869
Maybe they are on the ecosystem.

3213
01:59:54,869 --> 01:59:55,869
No, no.

3214
01:59:55,869 --> 01:59:57,219
They don't care about the ecosystem.

3215
01:59:57,219 --> 02:00:00,190
They may not even use 5% of the iPhone on
their phone.

3216
02:00:00,190 --> 02:00:02,750
All they are doing is just phone calls and
WhatsApp.

3217
02:00:02,750 --> 02:00:04,760
But just because they have the money.

3218
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:06,829
They just have to have it.

3219
02:00:06,829 --> 02:00:08,510
They have the money.

3220
02:00:08,510 --> 02:00:10,290
They have to have it.

3221
02:00:10,290 --> 02:00:11,599
They buy it.

3222
02:00:11,599 --> 02:00:21,770
They will buy 10 pieces of iPhone on day one
and gift it to their family.

3223
02:00:21,770 --> 02:00:23,849
Those who have to have it, still continue.

3224
02:00:23,849 --> 02:00:24,849
This is number one.

3225
02:00:24,849 --> 02:00:25,849
Number two.

3226
02:00:25,849 --> 02:00:26,889
Those people who are coming in the creator
space.

3227
02:00:26,889 --> 02:00:29,580
Because iPhone is such a robust device.

3228
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:30,860
Those young guys.

3229
02:00:30,860 --> 02:00:36,099
They will buy a phone and they know that this
is the phone which will be able to do multiple

3230
02:00:36,099 --> 02:00:37,099
things in once.

3231
02:00:37,099 --> 02:00:39,120
I can also edit on it.

3232
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:40,150
I can also shoot on it.

3233
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:41,150
The camera is also good.

3234
02:00:41,150 --> 02:00:42,150
Everything is good.

3235
02:00:42,150 --> 02:00:43,150
Instagram works well for example.

3236
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:44,150
They will get that.

3237
02:00:44,150 --> 02:00:45,150
In today's date.

3238
02:00:45,150 --> 02:00:46,469
The people who are buying only because of
the Apple logo.

3239
02:00:46,469 --> 02:00:47,520
That number is less.

3240
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:48,520
And what happens is.

3241
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:51,230
Earlier also when there was a number where
only the Apple logo was flexing.

3242
02:00:51,230 --> 02:00:54,260
Till the point he actually bought that phone.

3243
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:55,260
That thought will be there.

3244
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:56,440
But once they start using it.

3245
02:00:56,440 --> 02:00:57,440
Then it's no more.

3246
02:00:57,440 --> 02:00:58,700
Their next phone will be iPhone only.

3247
02:00:58,700 --> 02:01:00,150
I will add one more thing.

3248
02:01:00,150 --> 02:01:01,150
I also agree.

3249
02:01:01,150 --> 02:01:03,380
I think the person who drives the purchase.

3250
02:01:03,380 --> 02:01:05,699
I will break down a secret of the iPhone ad.

3251
02:01:05,699 --> 02:01:06,699
That if you ever give an ad of iPhone.

3252
02:01:06,699 --> 02:01:08,199
In that, a normal person will not use it.

3253
02:01:08,199 --> 02:01:09,199
They will show that a person is going.

3254
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:10,199
Climbing a mountain.

3255
02:01:10,199 --> 02:01:11,290
Coming down 50 meters in the sea.

3256
02:01:11,290 --> 02:01:12,726
So I think he drives the sale of a product.

3257
02:01:12,726 --> 02:01:13,726
That is when professionals start using something.

3258
02:01:13,726 --> 02:01:14,726
Now you will see.

3259
02:01:14,726 --> 02:01:15,726
In India or in the whole world.

3260
02:01:15,726 --> 02:01:16,726
All the cinematographers are using the iPhone.

3261
02:01:16,726 --> 02:01:17,726
All the gamers.

3262
02:01:17,726 --> 02:01:18,726
No matter where they get sponsors.

3263
02:01:18,726 --> 02:01:19,909
But they are actually streaming on the iPhone.

3264
02:01:19,909 --> 02:01:20,909
So all the professionals.

3265
02:01:20,909 --> 02:01:22,360
It is visible that they are using the iPhone.

3266
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:23,849
All the DJs have MacBooks.

3267
02:01:23,849 --> 02:01:25,719
They don't need a screen.

3268
02:01:25,719 --> 02:01:26,719
And the normal consumer.

3269
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:27,719
Follows this audience.

3270
02:01:27,719 --> 02:01:28,719
Follows the professional.

3271
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:29,920
Have you worn a watch ultra?

3272
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:33,180
Are you really the target customer for watch
ultra?

3273
02:01:33,180 --> 02:01:34,180
No.

3274
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:35,489
You are not the.

3275
02:01:35,489 --> 02:01:38,770
Where are you going to climb the mountain?

3276
02:01:38,770 --> 02:01:40,159
I don't know about you.

3277
02:01:40,159 --> 02:01:41,159
I said it.

3278
02:01:41,159 --> 02:01:42,159
But okay.

3279
02:01:42,159 --> 02:01:43,159
The watch is targeted for extreme sports.

3280
02:01:43,159 --> 02:01:44,159
Athletes.

3281
02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:45,159
Normally like that.

3282
02:01:45,159 --> 02:01:46,159
Since the launch of watch ultra.

3283
02:01:46,159 --> 02:01:47,159
All the people I have met.

3284
02:01:47,159 --> 02:01:48,159
Who used to use Apple watch.

3285
02:01:48,159 --> 02:01:49,159
Till yesterday.

3286
02:01:49,159 --> 02:01:50,159
Series 6, 7, 8.

3287
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:51,159
Whether they are the target customers or not.

3288
02:01:51,159 --> 02:01:52,159
They are all on ultra now.

3289
02:01:52,159 --> 02:01:53,159
Majority of them.

3290
02:01:53,159 --> 02:01:54,159
And the simple reason is.

3291
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:55,159
Because this is.

3292
02:01:55,159 --> 02:01:56,159
Battery is also broken.

3293
02:01:56,159 --> 02:01:57,159
Battery is one of the biggest reason.

3294
02:01:57,159 --> 02:01:58,159
Battery is the biggest reason.

3295
02:01:58,159 --> 02:01:59,159
To whom ever I have spoken.

3296
02:01:59,159 --> 02:02:00,159
But 3 raise 1 is nothing.

3297
02:02:00,159 --> 02:02:01,159
Apart from battery.

3298
02:02:01,159 --> 02:02:02,159
The reason is.

3299
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:03,159
Because this is the most expensive Apple watch.

3300
02:02:03,159 --> 02:02:04,159
This is the latest one.

3301
02:02:04,159 --> 02:02:05,159
They need to have it.

3302
02:02:05,159 --> 02:02:06,159
And that's the reason they have it.

3303
02:02:06,159 --> 02:02:07,159
I have seen people.

3304
02:02:07,159 --> 02:02:08,159
Which one are you wearing?

3305
02:02:08,159 --> 02:02:09,159
I have seen.

3306
02:02:09,159 --> 02:02:10,159
I am wearing a Rolex.

3307
02:02:10,159 --> 02:02:11,159
Which one are you wearing?

3308
02:02:11,159 --> 02:02:12,159
Rado.

3309
02:02:12,159 --> 02:02:13,159
Which one are you wearing?

3310
02:02:13,159 --> 02:02:14,159
AP.

3311
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:15,159
And I am not wearing a smart watch right now.

3312
02:02:15,159 --> 02:02:16,159
This is a very strange situation.

3313
02:02:16,159 --> 02:02:17,159
Forget that.

3314
02:02:17,159 --> 02:02:18,159
My point is.

3315
02:02:18,159 --> 02:02:19,159
I have seen.

3316
02:02:19,159 --> 02:02:20,159
I have seen people.

3317
02:02:20,159 --> 02:02:21,159
I will ask you an example.

3318
02:02:21,159 --> 02:02:22,159
I will ask you a simple question.

3319
02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:23,159
And I will tell you my reaction to it.

3320
02:02:23,159 --> 02:02:24,159
When Samsung launched Fold in India.

3321
02:02:24,159 --> 02:02:25,159
Or when it was launched in the world.

3322
02:02:25,159 --> 02:02:26,159
The idea was targeting towards professionals.

3323
02:02:26,159 --> 02:02:27,159
Businessmen.

3324
02:02:27,159 --> 02:02:28,159
Who will work on the go.

3325
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:29,159
This this this.

3326
02:02:29,159 --> 02:02:30,159
Okay I agree.

3327
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:31,159
To a certain extent.

3328
02:02:31,159 --> 02:02:32,159
Some people who actually do business.

3329
02:02:32,159 --> 02:02:33,159
And they need a fold phone.

3330
02:02:33,159 --> 02:02:34,159
And they used the phone.

3331
02:02:34,159 --> 02:02:35,159
Their life is changed now.

3332
02:02:35,159 --> 02:02:36,159
And I will tell you.

3333
02:02:36,159 --> 02:02:37,159
If we get the data of Samsung.

3334
02:02:37,159 --> 02:02:38,159
If we can tell something from Samsung.

3335
02:02:38,159 --> 02:02:39,159
In Delhi NCR.

3336
02:02:39,159 --> 02:02:40,159
All the people who have money.

3337
02:02:40,159 --> 02:02:41,159
They have kept 2 folds.

3338
02:02:41,159 --> 02:02:42,159
And they have no business.

3339
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:43,159
They don't do anything in the phone.

3340
02:02:43,159 --> 02:02:44,159
I have seen this.

3341
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:45,159
They have kept 2 folds.

3342
02:02:45,159 --> 02:02:46,159
In Pune too.

3343
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:47,159
And in Pune too.

3344
02:02:47,159 --> 02:02:48,159
And Samsung.

3345
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:49,159
And Samsung.

3346
02:02:49,159 --> 02:02:50,159
The sales that Samsung got in India.

3347
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:51,159
Of the folds.

3348
02:02:51,159 --> 02:02:52,159
They have got it from them.

3349
02:02:52,159 --> 02:02:53,159
Very few people from business.

3350
02:02:53,159 --> 02:02:57,369
But the one who had money.

3351
02:02:57,369 --> 02:02:59,139
The one who was able to buy.

3352
02:02:59,139 --> 02:03:00,440
He bought it.

3353
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:01,880
No no.

3354
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:03,719
Leave it in Delhi.

3355
02:03:03,719 --> 02:03:06,000
Same thing is there in iPhone.

3356
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,980
It is there in folds.

3357
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:10,170
They show you how to climb a mountain.

3358
02:03:10,170 --> 02:03:12,090
How to swim in the sea.

3359
02:03:12,090 --> 02:03:13,090
I am saying.

3360
02:03:13,090 --> 02:03:14,659
They have kept their watch.

3361
02:03:14,659 --> 02:03:16,579
And they are tracking their steps.

3362
02:03:16,579 --> 02:03:17,579
So.

3363
02:03:17,579 --> 02:03:18,579
In my opinion.

3364
02:03:18,579 --> 02:03:19,790
The professionals and top tier people.

3365
02:03:19,790 --> 02:03:20,840
Those who are using.

3366
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:21,840
Noravrandha follows them.

3367
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:23,159
So it is the same thing.

3368
02:03:23,159 --> 02:03:25,010
After listening to all your talks.

3369
02:03:25,010 --> 02:03:26,010
After summing up.

3370
02:03:26,010 --> 02:03:27,010
What I felt.

3371
02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:28,010
I will tell you.

3372
02:03:28,010 --> 02:03:29,010
Because you really got to learn.

3373
02:03:29,010 --> 02:03:30,010
One thing is understood.

3374
02:03:30,010 --> 02:03:31,010
Apple is one of the super lucky companies.

3375
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:32,010
If the aspiration ends.

3376
02:03:32,010 --> 02:03:33,010
In my opinion.

3377
02:03:33,010 --> 02:03:34,010
Lucky.

3378
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:35,010
Let's take an example.

3379
02:03:35,010 --> 02:03:36,010
The aspiration is over.

3380
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:37,010
Everyone has an iPhone.

3381
02:03:37,010 --> 02:03:38,010
But.

3382
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:39,010
Their foundation is so strong.

3383
02:03:39,010 --> 02:03:40,010
That the ecosystem has come.

3384
02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:41,010
Maybe you will buy airports.

3385
02:03:41,010 --> 02:03:42,010
Their sale is increasing.

3386
02:03:42,010 --> 02:03:43,010
Subscriptions and multiple things.

3387
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:44,010
Subscription has come.

3388
02:03:44,010 --> 02:03:45,010
Then.

3389
02:03:45,010 --> 02:03:46,010
MacBook.

3390
02:03:46,010 --> 02:03:47,010
As you named it.

3391
02:03:47,010 --> 02:03:48,010
It became popular among the creators.

3392
02:03:48,010 --> 02:03:49,010
We have seen.

3393
02:03:49,010 --> 02:03:50,010
The product becomes popular.

3394
02:03:50,010 --> 02:03:51,010
In the middle of the community.

3395
02:03:51,010 --> 02:03:52,010
So.

3396
02:03:52,010 --> 02:03:53,010
If it is in the middle of the creators.

3397
02:03:53,010 --> 02:03:54,010
Then he will buy a MacBook.

3398
02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:55,010
And Atom is also good.

3399
02:03:55,010 --> 02:03:56,010
Yes.

3400
02:03:56,010 --> 02:03:57,010
FCP.

3401
02:03:57,010 --> 02:03:58,010
Final Cut Pro will buy.

3402
02:03:58,010 --> 02:03:59,010
I think.

3403
02:03:59,010 --> 02:04:00,010
Apple.

3404
02:04:00,010 --> 02:04:01,010
Yes.

3405
02:04:01,010 --> 02:04:02,010
Lucky word.

3406
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:03,010
I agree.

3407
02:04:03,010 --> 02:04:04,010
I used it wrong.

3408
02:04:04,010 --> 02:04:05,010
The foundation they have built.

3409
02:04:05,010 --> 02:04:06,010
Their branches.

3410
02:04:06,010 --> 02:04:07,010
That is very solid.

3411
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:08,010
It will be strong.

3412
02:04:08,010 --> 02:04:09,010
I will give you an example.

3413
02:04:09,010 --> 02:04:10,010
I will give you an example.

3414
02:04:10,010 --> 02:04:11,010
Poco community.

3415
02:04:11,010 --> 02:04:12,010
Xiaomi community.

3416
02:04:12,010 --> 02:04:13,010
Any brand.

3417
02:04:13,010 --> 02:04:14,010
Realme community.

3418
02:04:14,010 --> 02:04:15,010
iQoo community.

3419
02:04:15,010 --> 02:04:16,010
All the Android communities.

3420
02:04:16,010 --> 02:04:17,010
Today.

3421
02:04:17,010 --> 02:04:18,010
If Xiaomi's product.

3422
02:04:18,010 --> 02:04:19,010
Becomes popular.

3423
02:04:19,010 --> 02:04:20,010
Then.

3424
02:04:20,010 --> 02:04:21,010
All the Android communities.

3425
02:04:21,010 --> 02:04:22,010
Today.

3426
02:04:22,010 --> 02:04:23,010
If Xiaomi's phone.

3427
02:04:23,010 --> 02:04:24,010
Is coming in the bracket of 10,000 or 15,000.

3428
02:04:24,010 --> 02:04:25,010
Redmi Note.

3429
02:04:25,010 --> 02:04:26,010
Something.

3430
02:04:26,010 --> 02:04:27,010
Which used to come at one time.

3431
02:04:27,010 --> 02:04:28,010
All those community members.

3432
02:04:28,010 --> 02:04:29,010
They are joining in.

3433
02:04:29,010 --> 02:04:30,010
They are using the Redmi phone.

3434
02:04:30,010 --> 02:04:31,010
They are a part of the community.

3435
02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:32,010
You tell them tomorrow.

3436
02:04:32,010 --> 02:04:33,010
Take this.

3437
02:04:33,010 --> 02:04:34,010
Your iPhone.

3438
02:04:34,010 --> 02:04:35,010
They will leave the community immediately.

3439
02:04:35,010 --> 02:04:36,010
They don't have that brand attachment.

3440
02:04:36,010 --> 02:04:37,010
Just because.

3441
02:04:37,010 --> 02:04:38,010
In today's date.

3442
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,010
Given his scenario.

3443
02:04:39,010 --> 02:04:40,010
His situation is.

3444
02:04:40,010 --> 02:04:41,010
His affordability is till there.

3445
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:42,010
He is doing that.

3446
02:04:42,010 --> 02:04:43,010
The day.

3447
02:04:43,010 --> 02:04:44,010
He is able to afford an iPhone.

3448
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:45,010
He will buy a second iPhone.

3449
02:04:45,010 --> 02:04:46,010
He doesn't have any attachment to Redmi.

3450
02:04:46,010 --> 02:04:47,010
I would disagree.

3451
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:48,010
To some extent.

3452
02:04:48,010 --> 02:04:49,010
Brand loyalty.

3453
02:04:49,010 --> 02:04:50,010
You get this.

3454
02:04:50,010 --> 02:04:51,010
I would just say.

3455
02:04:51,010 --> 02:04:52,010
Like premium customers.

3456
02:04:52,010 --> 02:04:53,010
Vivo.

3457
02:04:53,010 --> 02:04:54,010
Redmi is not premium.

3458
02:04:54,010 --> 02:04:55,010
I am talking about Redmi.

3459
02:04:55,010 --> 02:04:56,010
I am talking about less than 15,000.

3460
02:04:56,010 --> 02:04:57,010
Yes.

3461
02:04:57,010 --> 02:04:58,010
In a less priced point.

3462
02:04:58,010 --> 02:04:59,010
But like some Vivo customers.

3463
02:04:59,010 --> 02:05:00,010
And I have seen many Samsung customers.

3464
02:05:00,010 --> 02:05:01,010
Samsung and Apple.

3465
02:05:01,010 --> 02:05:02,010
Are on a level.

3466
02:05:02,010 --> 02:05:03,010
Oppo as well.

3467
02:05:03,010 --> 02:05:04,010
Oppo and Vivo.

3468
02:05:04,010 --> 02:05:05,010
Very strong this time.

3469
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:06,010
I was talking about.

3470
02:05:06,010 --> 02:05:07,010
This budget range.

3471
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:08,010
Ok.

3472
02:05:08,010 --> 02:05:09,010
One question.

3473
02:05:09,010 --> 02:05:10,010
If we shift from the iPhone.

3474
02:05:10,010 --> 02:05:11,010
Then.

3475
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:12,010
Which brand according to you.

3476
02:05:12,010 --> 02:05:13,010
Which brand.

3477
02:05:13,010 --> 02:05:14,010
Is the most popular.

3478
02:05:14,010 --> 02:05:15,010
Now.

3479
02:05:15,010 --> 02:05:16,010
I mean.

3480
02:05:16,010 --> 02:05:17,010
Which is most popular.

3481
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:18,010
And according to you guys, and it might be
controversial, which brand first?

3482
02:05:18,010 --> 02:05:19,010
And we are going to talk to Bebop and Tamil.

3483
02:05:19,010 --> 02:05:20,010
Which brand in 2023 do you think did the best
brand of smartphone?

3484
02:05:20,010 --> 02:05:21,010
In Android, no?

3485
02:05:21,010 --> 02:05:22,010
In Android.

3486
02:05:22,010 --> 02:05:23,010
To make it interesting, it has to be one.

3487
02:05:23,010 --> 02:05:24,010
If we say that, then you won't know.

3488
02:05:24,010 --> 02:05:25,010
OK, so for me, it may be iQOO for two reasons.

3489
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:26,010
One, when you see at the budget segment, iQOO
predominantly in the market only to sell the

3490
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:27,010
performance.

3491
02:05:27,010 --> 02:05:28,010
But this time,
what they did is, with iQOO Z7 Pro, it might

3492
02:05:28,010 --> 02:05:29,010
be a rebranded smartphone, whatever it is.

3493
02:05:29,010 --> 02:05:34,080
But in a particular price segment, they launched
the smartphone with a good processor and also

3494
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,080
with good cameras.

3495
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:39,350
So in my video, most of the people who are
asking about the budget segment smartphone,

3496
02:05:39,350 --> 02:05:40,350
I recommend that one.

3497
02:05:40,350 --> 02:05:41,350
And to a far extent, the software is not refined
before.

3498
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:45,290
But iQOO 12, they changed it, maybe not 100%,
but at least by 40% or 30%.

3499
02:05:45,290 --> 02:05:46,290
They improved a bit.

3500
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:47,780
So that's what I personally feel.

3501
02:05:47,780 --> 02:05:48,780
What about?

3502
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:49,780
We have to name one, huh?

3503
02:05:49,780 --> 02:05:50,780
Yeah, that's when the fun starts.

3504
02:05:50,780 --> 02:05:53,409
You can also say none, so that's fine.

3505
02:05:53,409 --> 02:05:54,719
If you don't know.

3506
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:56,349
It's not like there's no one.

3507
02:05:56,349 --> 02:05:58,780
But one thing, like,
He's making fun of us.

3508
02:05:58,780 --> 02:06:05,150
Now, the thing I'm notifying,
I read a lot of stats, and I come to realize

3509
02:06:05,150 --> 02:06:09,829
that, like
inflation, like we were talking about, in

3510
02:06:09,829 --> 02:06:11,489
smartphones, so usually the inflation number
that the government shares with us, which

3511
02:06:11,489 --> 02:06:13,420
is 6-7%, but in smartphones, in India, it
was 12%.

3512
02:06:13,420 --> 02:06:16,659
So I'm not expecting the smartphone prices
to go down in the coming year.

3513
02:06:16,659 --> 02:06:17,659
I'm only expecting them to go high.

3514
02:06:17,659 --> 02:06:21,210
But at the same time, I'm also feeling that
the smartphones that will come, they will

3515
02:06:21,210 --> 02:06:22,909
be a little lean.

3516
02:06:22,909 --> 02:06:24,489
They will not be launching every other month.

3517
02:06:24,489 --> 02:06:25,489
Their product...

3518
02:06:25,489 --> 02:06:26,489
They will reduce the portfolio.

3519
02:06:26,489 --> 02:06:28,380
I feel that way.

3520
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:29,380
The question was different, by the way.

3521
02:06:29,380 --> 02:06:30,380
Yeah, yeah.

3522
02:06:30,380 --> 02:06:31,380
You made me go crazy.

3523
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:32,380
Say yes, man.

3524
02:06:32,380 --> 02:06:34,750
I am calculating the percentage right now.

3525
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:37,180
I was about to ask him what was the answer.

3526
02:06:37,180 --> 02:06:38,460
So, I am coming to that.

3527
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:39,460
One word answer.

3528
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:40,460
One word answer.

3529
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:41,460
It should be a one word answer.

3530
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:42,460
Explanation later.

3531
02:06:42,460 --> 02:06:44,650
So, for me, I think OnePlus Open is a standout
device for me.

3532
02:06:44,650 --> 02:06:46,660
And with that regard, it's OnePlus for me.

3533
02:06:46,660 --> 02:06:47,660
Yeah.

3534
02:06:47,660 --> 02:06:48,660
Same here.

3535
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:49,660
OnePlus.

3536
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:50,660
Why?

3537
02:06:50,660 --> 02:06:51,660
Because one thing is that they have this green
line issue.

3538
02:06:51,660 --> 02:06:53,719
The software issue which has been rapidly
happening with a lot of customers.

3539
02:06:53,719 --> 02:06:59,179
They rectified it and they gave a proper explanation
on why.

3540
02:06:59,179 --> 02:07:03,590
And again, with their product range, OnePlus
11 and the Open looks very nice.

3541
02:07:03,590 --> 02:07:05,369
Even the pad is also good.

3542
02:07:05,369 --> 02:07:06,369
OnePlus.

3543
02:07:06,369 --> 02:07:07,369
OnePlus.

3544
02:07:07,369 --> 02:07:08,369
So, the one brand that stood out for you is
OnePlus?

3545
02:07:08,369 --> 02:07:09,369
I cannot stop using the OnePlus Open.

3546
02:07:09,369 --> 02:07:10,369
It's that good.

3547
02:07:10,369 --> 02:07:12,310
Also, I mean, a lot of the...

3548
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:14,260
Sometimes a single product can define a whole
year.

3549
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:15,260
Yeah, yeah.

3550
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:16,260
Define a whole year.

3551
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:17,860
Because we were all waiting for it as well,
right?

3552
02:07:17,860 --> 02:07:18,860
For OnePlus' first foldable.

3553
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:19,860
Did it sell?

3554
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:20,860
Did it sell?

3555
02:07:20,860 --> 02:07:21,860
Yes.

3556
02:07:21,860 --> 02:07:22,860
I'm not sure about that.

3557
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:23,860
I'm not sure about the numbers.

3558
02:07:23,860 --> 02:07:24,860
From a techie's perspective.

3559
02:07:24,860 --> 02:07:25,860
So, I'm not sure about the numbers, but okay.

3560
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:27,130
So, two things I liked about the OnePlus Open.

3561
02:07:27,130 --> 02:07:28,730
The approach of OnePlus towards the Open.

3562
02:07:28,730 --> 02:07:32,290
One, they didn't make it like they launched
a foldable for Rs. 80,000.

3563
02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:33,290
It's premium.

3564
02:07:33,290 --> 02:07:36,010
They launched it at a premium price in India.

3565
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:39,040
We know that Samsung will launch it for Rs.

3566
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:40,040
1.5 Lakhs.

3567
02:07:40,040 --> 02:07:43,090
So, they also have one for Rs. 40,000, number
one.

3568
02:07:43,090 --> 02:07:44,889
They didn't play on the price bit.

3569
02:07:44,889 --> 02:07:47,809
They know that they need to establish that
as a premium product.

3570
02:07:47,809 --> 02:07:50,210
Second thing, they went all out with marketing.

3571
02:07:50,210 --> 02:07:53,820
Go to airports, go to premium places, you'll
see Open all around.

3572
02:07:53,820 --> 02:07:57,130
So, okay, you can't expect results straight
from the first year.

3573
02:07:57,130 --> 02:08:00,079
But it clearly shows the trajectory ahead.

3574
02:08:00,079 --> 02:08:03,760
That in the coming years, they will be there.

3575
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:08,620
And I think it looks good from this point
that they will have a certain solid line-up

3576
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:09,620
in the foldables.

3577
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:10,620
Yeah, exactly.

3578
02:08:10,620 --> 02:08:12,760
I mean, I wasn't finishing my answer.

3579
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:16,199
It's that OnePlus also not just the Open across.

3580
02:08:16,199 --> 02:08:20,790
Like, they refined their line-up or they,
you know, made it better this year with the

3581
02:08:20,790 --> 02:08:22,070
Nord CE 3 and the Nord 3.

3582
02:08:22,070 --> 02:08:23,070
11R, I think.

3583
02:08:23,070 --> 02:08:24,070
11R was a fantastic device.

3584
02:08:24,070 --> 02:08:26,059
So, you know that at every segment, there's
a OnePlus phone to cater to every audience.

3585
02:08:26,059 --> 02:08:29,880
So, even if you don't like the phone or not,
as a reviewer, people are buying it.

3586
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:34,070
I saw so many OnePlus Nord CE 3s, it's not
even funny.

3587
02:08:34,070 --> 02:08:37,260
Even at airports and the Nord Buds 2R.

3588
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:38,260
So popular.

3589
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:39,949
So, OnePlus is actually getting the audience
to acknowledge their devices and buy it.

3590
02:08:39,949 --> 02:08:41,110
So, they've done a good job.

3591
02:08:41,110 --> 02:08:46,449
And I think they will continue to do a good
job if they continue to keep it this way.

3592
02:08:46,449 --> 02:08:47,540
And if they could just kind of do a segregation
between Open.

3593
02:08:47,540 --> 02:08:48,540
Just answer my question.

3594
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:49,599
Who has improved the most?

3595
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:51,219
Which smartphone brand impressed you in 2023?

3596
02:08:51,219 --> 02:08:52,219
Simple.

3597
02:08:52,219 --> 02:08:53,219
OnePlus.

3598
02:08:53,219 --> 02:08:54,219
OnePlus, for sure.

3599
02:08:54,219 --> 02:08:55,219
Alright.

3600
02:08:55,219 --> 02:08:56,219
For me too, I found one thing very interesting
in OnePlus this year.

3601
02:08:56,219 --> 02:08:57,219
Like, I tried OnePlus 12.

3602
02:08:57,219 --> 02:08:58,219
It is all an experiment.

3603
02:08:58,219 --> 02:09:00,810
I mean, all the things, like, the alert slider,
they removed it first.

3604
02:09:00,810 --> 02:09:03,199
Then they put it back on the right side.

3605
02:09:03,199 --> 02:09:05,840
Now they put it on the left side.

3606
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:08,530
And in its software, they sometimes put the
aperture slider up.

3607
02:09:08,530 --> 02:09:10,490
So, every phone is like full of experiments.

3608
02:09:10,490 --> 02:09:13,100
And there were a lot of issues with it, like
the green line issue.

3609
02:09:13,100 --> 02:09:14,280
But some experiments have been done.

3610
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:16,429
Like, OnePlus Open was, in my opinion, a very
risky product.

3611
02:09:16,429 --> 02:09:17,429
Yeah.

3612
02:09:17,429 --> 02:09:18,429
Because it would cost Rs. 1 lakh.

3613
02:09:18,429 --> 02:09:19,429
And to launch it at that price.

3614
02:09:19,429 --> 02:09:20,900
So, in my opinion,
OnePlus showed the guts to experiment, and

3615
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:22,290
I would give it to them.

3616
02:09:22,290 --> 02:09:26,179
Because OnePlus Open is genuinely a good smartphone,
but it is not there yet.

3617
02:09:26,179 --> 02:09:28,409
There is no actual proof of concept yet.

3618
02:09:28,409 --> 02:09:29,520
Which brand is it?

3619
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:30,520
OnePlus.

3620
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:31,520
It's the same.

3621
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:32,520
It's not there yet.

3622
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:33,960
I had two, but I have to pick only one.

3623
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:35,079
But I would say,
OnePlus and Motorola.

3624
02:09:35,079 --> 02:09:38,090
These were the two brands that, in my opinion,
they did very, very well.

3625
02:09:38,090 --> 02:09:40,220
But, OnePlus is the winner because of that
OnePlus Open.

3626
02:09:40,220 --> 02:09:44,140
When OnePlus 11, 11R, all these came, and
if you see the 10, I mean, the ones before

3627
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:46,929
2022, those two years, OnePlus launched shit
phones.

3628
02:09:46,929 --> 02:09:50,760
But this year, 2023, whether, all the series
you look at

3629
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:53,829
it, whether it is Nord or Nord C, or their
11, 11R,

3630
02:09:53,829 --> 02:09:55,489
excellent phones, but, best thing,
OnePlus Open.

3631
02:09:55,489 --> 02:09:56,489
Wow.

3632
02:09:56,489 --> 02:09:57,489
And that's why,
OnePlus is my brand.

3633
02:09:57,489 --> 02:10:00,469
I can copy the video of Babar Azam from Pakistan.

3634
02:10:00,469 --> 02:10:03,210
There's a video that has gone viral, where
Rohit Sharma says a long answer in English.

3635
02:10:03,210 --> 02:10:04,449
And Babar says, yes, my answer is also same.

3636
02:10:04,449 --> 02:10:05,449
Yes, same, same.

3637
02:10:05,449 --> 02:10:07,909
So, OnePlus, the reason for that is, again,
was OnePlus 7

3638
02:10:07,909 --> 02:10:09,750
Pro or 7T Pro?

3639
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:13,159
It had a pop-up camera and a curved screen.

3640
02:10:13,159 --> 02:10:14,409
Both 7 and 7 Pro.

3641
02:10:14,409 --> 02:10:15,409
That was the last amazing OnePlus.

3642
02:10:15,409 --> 02:10:19,179
We saw the deviation in 8, 9, 10.

3643
02:10:19,179 --> 02:10:21,170
But this year, and it clearly showed, that
was the

3644
02:10:21,170 --> 02:10:22,860
beginning, 11, 11R, everything is going well.

3645
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:25,389
Nord C, I'll give you an example.

3646
02:10:25,389 --> 02:10:28,440
I was in BITS Pilani, Hyderabad campus.

3647
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:32,690
I must have taken at least 500-700 selfies
there.

3648
02:10:32,690 --> 02:10:37,449
And 80% was using that, lime color, what color
is it?

3649
02:10:37,449 --> 02:10:38,449
Lime color.

3650
02:10:38,449 --> 02:10:39,449
Lime color, CE3 light.

3651
02:10:39,449 --> 02:10:42,530
I mean, I'm seeing that every other student
has CE3 light.

3652
02:10:42,530 --> 02:10:46,460
CE2 light was the highest setting.

3653
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:49,920
I said CE3 light is also going to be the highest.

3654
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:52,139
For that matter, even Nord 3T light.

3655
02:10:52,139 --> 02:10:53,730
3T, amazing performance, good package.

3656
02:10:53,730 --> 02:10:55,310
Open, they have nailed it.

3657
02:10:55,310 --> 02:10:58,999
So, I think, acknowledging the faults, what
went wrong over the years, and coming up with

3658
02:10:58,999 --> 02:11:00,980
a solid lineup,
I think OnePlus.

3659
02:11:00,980 --> 02:11:07,610
And I remember speaking to OnePlus guys in
2022, and they had told me that, you look

3660
02:11:07,610 --> 02:11:12,139
at 2023, the lineup we have, you will change
the thought process about OnePlus.

3661
02:11:12,139 --> 02:11:13,599
So, they have done it.

3662
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:14,599
Yes, sir.

3663
02:11:14,599 --> 02:11:15,599
Tell me.

3664
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:18,860
So, I think everybody has already said quite
a few interesting things.

3665
02:11:18,860 --> 02:11:21,570
You know, OnePlus seems to beâ€¦
Wait a minute.

3666
02:11:21,570 --> 02:11:22,570
Let's score them.

3667
02:11:22,570 --> 02:11:23,570
IQ got one.

3668
02:11:23,570 --> 02:11:24,659
OnePlus, OnePlus, OnePlus, OnePlus, OnePlus,
OnePlus, OnePlus, OnePlus.

3669
02:11:24,659 --> 02:11:26,770
Why is OnePlus written on the bottle?

3670
02:11:26,770 --> 02:11:28,179
But my answer is not OnePlus.

3671
02:11:28,179 --> 02:11:29,530
So, edges are different then.

3672
02:11:29,530 --> 02:11:30,610
The middle, the middle.

3673
02:11:30,610 --> 02:11:31,610
So, acknowledged OnePlus.

3674
02:11:31,610 --> 02:11:32,610
Motorola, you said, was fantastic.

3675
02:11:32,610 --> 02:11:35,360
I think Vivo is another company that is doing
some great work.

3676
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:36,360
Don't be diplomatic.

3677
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:38,730
You only said, don't say two, and now he said
three.

3678
02:11:38,730 --> 02:11:39,940
You've already done all this.

3679
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:41,040
You've already done all this.

3680
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:42,040
It's done.

3681
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:43,550
But I'll give a very, very contradictory answer.

3682
02:11:43,550 --> 02:11:48,540
Another company that has really impressed
me this year is another company that is pushing

3683
02:11:48,540 --> 02:11:50,929
innovation at price points that are not possible.

3684
02:11:50,929 --> 02:11:52,030
They are opening up markets.

3685
02:11:52,030 --> 02:11:53,719
It's making people imagine, and that is techno.

3686
02:11:53,719 --> 02:11:54,989
I was about to say that.

3687
02:11:54,989 --> 02:12:01,369
It's a very unusual thing for a company to
have the guts to be able to take so many risks.

3688
02:12:01,369 --> 02:12:06,880
Whether you look at folding phones or flip
phones, they want to be premium also.

3689
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:09,369
They want to bring in things in very different
ways.

3690
02:12:09,369 --> 02:12:12,199
I like the guts of that company, and I'd love
to see what they do in 2024.

3691
02:12:12,199 --> 02:12:17,780
Because the people who never thought of buying
a folding phone, at least they still may not

3692
02:12:17,780 --> 02:12:18,820
be buying it.

3693
02:12:18,820 --> 02:12:21,219
I don't know what they are selling.

3694
02:12:21,219 --> 02:12:27,449
The people who have never bought a folding
phone, I don't think they'll buy a techno

3695
02:12:27,449 --> 02:12:28,449
phone.

3696
02:12:28,449 --> 02:12:29,449
I bought that.

3697
02:12:29,449 --> 02:12:30,449
You bought it?

3698
02:12:30,449 --> 02:12:31,449
Bro, look at its hinge.

3699
02:12:31,449 --> 02:12:32,449
But I had a poster.

3700
02:12:32,449 --> 02:12:34,860
It's been a while, the hinge is moving.

3701
02:12:34,860 --> 02:12:35,860
I had a poster.

3702
02:12:35,860 --> 02:12:37,370
Sales of the folding techno phone.

3703
02:12:37,370 --> 02:12:38,719
With that techno folding.

3704
02:12:38,719 --> 02:12:41,750
I saw your video and bought that techno folding.

3705
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:44,110
And he was very happy with it.

3706
02:12:44,110 --> 02:12:45,460
So I'm actually surprised.

3707
02:12:45,460 --> 02:12:47,750
I work with a lot of analysts who only track
this.

3708
02:12:47,750 --> 02:12:50,060
And they track it through various sources,
including from mobile networks, which phone

3709
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:51,060
is latching on.

3710
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:52,440
So they have all these numbers, instead of
just fake numbers from brands.

3711
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:53,510
They've actually sold very well.

3712
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:55,849
And the fold has sold more than their flip.

3713
02:12:55,849 --> 02:12:57,239
Yeah, even I like the Camo series.

3714
02:12:57,239 --> 02:12:58,239
Yeah, that was nice.

3715
02:12:58,239 --> 02:12:59,239
Okay, I think...

3716
02:12:59,239 --> 02:13:02,150
The last question, and I want to close off
with...

3717
02:13:02,150 --> 02:13:03,280
Something very interesting.

3718
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:06,329
I mean, we all review phones, so we get phones
to use.

3719
02:13:06,329 --> 02:13:10,139
But I'm pretty sure that we're also buying
gadgets of our own, right?

3720
02:13:10,139 --> 02:13:11,309
I'm not so sure.

3721
02:13:11,309 --> 02:13:13,780
I just want to double check that now.

3722
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:19,489
Starting from Rajiv, what's the best and the
worst gadget purchase of 2023 for you?

3723
02:13:19,489 --> 02:13:21,159
Best and worst, huh?

3724
02:13:21,159 --> 02:13:22,510
Best and worst, one-one each.

3725
02:13:22,510 --> 02:13:24,929
So I'll tell you, I'll give you a guess.

3726
02:13:24,929 --> 02:13:27,969
I think everybody has enough time to think
about it.

3727
02:13:27,969 --> 02:13:29,570
So I think I bought...

3728
02:13:29,570 --> 02:13:32,040
One of my best purchases has been an LG OLED
TV.

3729
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:34,010
I'm very surprised at just how good they are
getting this technology and at prices that

3730
02:13:34,010 --> 02:13:35,510
I could not even imagine, right?

3731
02:13:35,510 --> 02:13:36,510
Absolutely fantastic.

3732
02:13:36,510 --> 02:13:40,969
And because I was in a very big hurry, and
I was very excited by it because I've been

3733
02:13:40,969 --> 02:13:44,079
using it for years, my disappointment one
was the new Sony XM5.

3734
02:13:44,079 --> 02:13:45,079
Oh.

3735
02:13:45,079 --> 02:13:46,079
It's still a great product.

3736
02:13:46,079 --> 02:13:47,659
It's just that I still feel that the previous
generation is better.

3737
02:13:47,659 --> 02:13:48,659
The overhead ones?

3738
02:13:48,659 --> 02:13:49,659
No, no, no.

3739
02:13:49,659 --> 02:13:50,809
You should have kept it to smartphone.

3740
02:13:50,809 --> 02:13:53,240
Did you buy it and which one was the worst?

3741
02:13:53,240 --> 02:13:55,200
Both have been bought.

3742
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:59,099
I said I was in a big hurry, so I actually
bought it from abroad.

3743
02:13:59,099 --> 02:14:00,099
My worst...

3744
02:14:00,099 --> 02:14:01,750
To be honest, I can't remember it and I can't
highlight it.

3745
02:14:01,750 --> 02:14:03,430
But the best I know is the DJI Osmo Pocket
3.

3746
02:14:03,430 --> 02:14:04,430
Yeah.

3747
02:14:04,430 --> 02:14:05,430
Amazing, cute little camera.

3748
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:06,430
Handheld, inbuilt gimbal, it's a one-inch
sensor.

3749
02:14:06,430 --> 02:14:07,430
Comes with a mic that's automatically paired
with the camera.

3750
02:14:07,430 --> 02:14:08,430
It's a good thing.

3751
02:14:08,430 --> 02:14:12,380
Are you using it regularly for content creation?

3752
02:14:12,380 --> 02:14:17,719
No, so I haven't used it much till now.

3753
02:14:17,719 --> 02:14:21,030
But I think if I have to carry just one camera,
sometimes you can't carry a big DSLR for vlogging

3754
02:14:21,030 --> 02:14:22,030
and stuff.

3755
02:14:22,030 --> 02:14:23,030
Right.

3756
02:14:23,030 --> 02:14:27,360
And if you use an iPhone, you have to use
a rear camera, use a wide angle, low light

3757
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:28,360
is not that good sometimes.

3758
02:14:28,360 --> 02:14:29,360
You know, it has its own complications.

3759
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:33,820
So this small gimbal which you can attach
a small tripod, it will stay in one place,

3760
02:14:33,820 --> 02:14:37,050
you know, self-tracking and all those things.

3761
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:39,150
So I think it's a good camera.

3762
02:14:39,150 --> 02:14:45,980
And, yeah, the best has happened, but the
worst is not coming to my mind at this time.

3763
02:14:45,980 --> 02:14:46,980
Yeah.

3764
02:14:46,980 --> 02:14:48,040
I have not bought too many things.

3765
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:52,260
Honestly, only the one I remember and which
I think was excellent was the MetaQuest 3

3766
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:53,260
which I got from the UK.

3767
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:54,260
We forced you to get it.

3768
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:55,260
Yeah, yeah.

3769
02:14:55,260 --> 02:14:56,260
Perfect, correct.

3770
02:14:56,260 --> 02:14:57,260
Yeah, so that's all.

3771
02:14:57,260 --> 02:14:58,260
I don't have...

3772
02:14:58,260 --> 02:14:59,260
I haven't even purchased the rest yet.

3773
02:14:59,260 --> 02:15:00,510
I have bought a bedsheet for around 2-2.5
lakhs.

3774
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:02,271
And what happens in that, it is 8-sleeve.

3775
02:15:02,271 --> 02:15:04,300
And the world's top...

3776
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:05,860
Nowadays, he has gone into bio-hacking.

3777
02:15:05,860 --> 02:15:06,860
Health, fitness.

3778
02:15:06,860 --> 02:15:07,949
We haven't talked about that yet.

3779
02:15:07,949 --> 02:15:09,130
Health, fitness of creators.

3780
02:15:09,130 --> 02:15:14,010
It is a bedsheet that changes the temperature
of your body so that your sleep improves.

3781
02:15:14,010 --> 02:15:15,010
Elon Musk.

3782
02:15:15,010 --> 02:15:16,010
Top athletes.

3783
02:15:16,010 --> 02:15:17,010
A lot of billionaires.

3784
02:15:17,010 --> 02:15:19,090
They all use it.

3785
02:15:19,090 --> 02:15:24,120
And when you hear it, you'll think, what is
he sleeping on?

3786
02:15:24,120 --> 02:15:25,280
But that has improved my sleep a lot.

3787
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:28,469
And I think sleep is something that has a
huge impact on life.

3788
02:15:28,469 --> 02:15:33,389
So my best purchase so far is the same as
of this year.

3789
02:15:33,389 --> 02:15:34,540
Send me the link.

3790
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:35,540
Yes, 100%.

3791
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:36,610
I have a question.

3792
02:15:36,610 --> 02:15:37,699
It's not sponsored.

3793
02:15:37,699 --> 02:15:38,800
No, no, no.

3794
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:41,360
Does he have an app or not?

3795
02:15:41,360 --> 02:15:42,659
I haven't used his app much.

3796
02:15:42,659 --> 02:15:43,659
He has an app.

3797
02:15:43,659 --> 02:15:44,659
Okay.

3798
02:15:44,659 --> 02:15:45,659
So do you do any preset?

3799
02:15:45,659 --> 02:15:46,659
Or you don't have to do anything?

3800
02:15:46,659 --> 02:15:48,550
I just set it like that.

3801
02:15:48,550 --> 02:15:52,020
I'm asking the question because
I have a lot of trouble getting up.

3802
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:53,020
Okay.

3803
02:15:53,020 --> 02:15:54,020
I can't get up.

3804
02:15:54,020 --> 02:15:55,020
I mean, I enjoy sleeping.

3805
02:15:55,020 --> 02:15:56,020
And my deep sleep becomes very deep.

3806
02:15:56,020 --> 02:16:00,840
So I thought if he has an app where you can
set an alarm kind of thing that at 8 in the

3807
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:02,360
morning, you can make it completely cold.

3808
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:03,360
I'll answer.

3809
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:04,360
Then the eyes will open or something.

3810
02:16:04,360 --> 02:16:05,360
What does it actually do?

3811
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:06,360
No, no, no.

3812
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:07,360
I'll answer.

3813
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:08,360
Absolutely.

3814
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:09,360
So you can actually, it's called a silent
alarm on this.

3815
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:10,360
Okay.

3816
02:16:10,360 --> 02:16:11,360
It vibrates.

3817
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:12,360
Vibration is a new term.

3818
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:13,360
No, no, no.

3819
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:14,360
No, no, no.

3820
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:15,360
It does it with temperature.

3821
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,360
It does it with temperature.

3822
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:17,360
It increases the temperature.

3823
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:18,360
It's very slowly.

3824
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:19,360
Changes the temperature enough.

3825
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:20,360
It's a good thing if there is something like
that.

3826
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:22,409
If I have 150 alarms on my phone,
I can't open my eyes.

3827
02:16:22,409 --> 02:16:23,409
Worst?

3828
02:16:23,409 --> 02:16:24,409
Worst?

3829
02:16:24,409 --> 02:16:25,409
Worst?

3830
02:16:25,409 --> 02:16:26,409
I don't purchase worst things.

3831
02:16:26,409 --> 02:16:27,409
Say worst ever.

3832
02:16:27,409 --> 02:16:28,409
If you want to say, even if you buy it in
2022.

3833
02:16:28,409 --> 02:16:29,610
It was worst for us that I bought a RED camera.

3834
02:16:29,610 --> 02:16:32,160
And I think the whole set-up cost me 10-15
lakhs.

3835
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:36,010
But it's so tough to use that we used it in
5-6 videos.

3836
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:41,179
So it's worst for us but it can be good for
someone.

3837
02:16:41,179 --> 02:16:42,179
Not fitting in your routine.

3838
02:16:42,179 --> 02:16:43,179
Not fitting in your routine.

3839
02:16:43,179 --> 02:16:44,179
The workflow.

3840
02:16:44,179 --> 02:16:45,179
Got it, got it.

3841
02:16:45,179 --> 02:16:46,179
Okay, okay.

3842
02:16:46,179 --> 02:16:47,179
Next, I'll tell you.

3843
02:16:47,179 --> 02:16:48,860
Best, I felt,
I enjoy audio products a lot.

3844
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:50,719
I spend the most money on audio products.

3845
02:16:50,719 --> 02:16:51,719
Like what?

3846
02:16:51,719 --> 02:16:52,770
So there is a Sony soundbar.

3847
02:16:52,770 --> 02:16:53,770
Sony HT-A7000, I think.

3848
02:16:53,770 --> 02:16:54,770
I bought that.

3849
02:16:54,770 --> 02:16:56,620
And the surround sound experience that I get
from that soundbar.

3850
02:16:56,620 --> 02:16:57,620
I went crazy.

3851
02:16:57,620 --> 02:16:58,620
I have it at home.

3852
02:16:58,620 --> 02:16:59,620
I do it a lot.

3853
02:16:59,620 --> 02:17:01,000
I enjoy it a lot.

3854
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,000
With the rear speakers and...

3855
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Exactly.

3856
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
3.1?

3857
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
No, no.

3858
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
7.1.

3859
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,000
7.1.

3860
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,000
It's wireless.

3861
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,000
It's wireless.

3862
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
The one you picked up for the...

3863
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
The same one you picked up.

3864
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Same one.

3865
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
So I also have the same one.

3866
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Same one, same one.

3867
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
HT-A7000.

3868
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,000
How much is it for?

3869
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,000
I think 1-2 lakhs.

3870
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,000
2.5 lakhs for the whole setup.

3871
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Rear speakers and the woofer.

3872
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Okay, it has rear speakers too.

3873
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,000
I can add everything.

3874
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,000
I can add as many speakers as I want.

3875
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Crazy experience.

3876
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:24,000
White, white.

3877
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I mean, I'm satisfied.

3878
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
But he's talking about soundbar.

3879
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
If I don't buy the soundbar...

3880
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,000
No, no, you can get a soundbar plus those...

3881
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Yes.

3882
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,000
I thought it only comes as a package with
the two speakers.

3883
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,130
No, four speakers and soundbar.

3884
02:17:31,130 --> 02:17:32,760
You can fit it anywhere.

3885
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:34,710
You just have to give power.

3886
02:17:34,710 --> 02:17:35,710
Sony's naming convention.

3887
02:17:35,710 --> 02:17:36,729
Coming back to this thing.

3888
02:17:36,729 --> 02:17:39,649
I think the A9s were the ones with the four
speakers setup.

3889
02:17:39,649 --> 02:17:42,090
And there was the A7000 with the soundbar.

3890
02:17:42,090 --> 02:17:43,090
Soundbar and...

3891
02:17:43,090 --> 02:17:44,219
Subwoofer comes with it, right?

3892
02:17:44,219 --> 02:17:45,439
Subwoofer comes with it.

3893
02:17:45,439 --> 02:17:47,569
When they said XM5, headphones or earphones...

3894
02:17:47,569 --> 02:17:48,569
Subwoofer package.

3895
02:17:48,569 --> 02:17:50,889
But if you're asking about a particular product,
then...

3896
02:17:50,889 --> 02:17:51,950
It comes in a bundle.

3897
02:17:51,950 --> 02:17:54,120
You have to say something.

3898
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:57,160
I mean, it comes in a bundle.

3899
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:59,510
I bought the whole bundle.

3900
02:17:59,510 --> 02:18:01,179
And I'm very happy.

3901
02:18:01,179 --> 02:18:03,460
Should I talk about the worst?

3902
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:05,219
It's the exact same setup and...

3903
02:18:05,219 --> 02:18:06,519
How much did it cost?

3904
02:18:06,519 --> 02:18:07,519
2.5 Lakh.

3905
02:18:07,519 --> 02:18:11,170
The second worst I can recall because as such,
I'm telling you all the time.

3906
02:18:11,170 --> 02:18:12,330
I just bought it.

3907
02:18:12,330 --> 02:18:15,939
Recently, to make a video,
I bought a Blackberry passport.

3908
02:18:15,939 --> 02:18:16,939
Oh God!

3909
02:18:16,939 --> 02:18:18,139
Why did you make it?

3910
02:18:18,139 --> 02:18:19,139
Don't say that.

3911
02:18:19,139 --> 02:18:20,660
I used to use it.

3912
02:18:20,660 --> 02:18:22,679
And it was a very strong phone.

3913
02:18:22,679 --> 02:18:23,860
Today, it's experience is bad.

3914
02:18:23,860 --> 02:18:24,860
Because today...

3915
02:18:24,860 --> 02:18:26,059
It was from the time of iPhone 6.

3916
02:18:26,059 --> 02:18:28,000
And I was comparing it side by side.

3917
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I thought...

3918
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,179
There was so much wrong in it.

3919
02:18:30,179 --> 02:18:31,179
I was using it at that time.

3920
02:18:31,179 --> 02:18:32,660
See, I used to text.

3921
02:18:32,660 --> 02:18:34,809
And in that, the keypad is all touch sensitive.

3922
02:18:34,809 --> 02:18:35,809
You're typing.

3923
02:18:35,809 --> 02:18:38,420
It used to give you three options in predictive
text.

3924
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:40,219
One here, one here, one here.

3925
02:18:40,219 --> 02:18:42,880
The area where you swipe on the keypad, that
word will come.

3926
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:44,750
And I used it like crazy.

3927
02:18:44,750 --> 02:18:45,750
Its screen...

3928
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:46,750
It's I think...

3929
02:18:46,750 --> 02:18:47,750
1440 by 1440.

3930
02:18:47,750 --> 02:18:48,750
1440 by 1440.

3931
02:18:48,750 --> 02:18:49,750
Like a square.

3932
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:50,750
Square.

3933
02:18:50,750 --> 02:18:51,750
So, today...

3934
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:52,750
I...

3935
02:18:52,750 --> 02:18:53,750
I...

3936
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:54,750
It's my phone.

3937
02:18:54,750 --> 02:18:55,750
That's what I said.

3938
02:18:55,750 --> 02:18:56,750
Of all time, which I bought in 2023, what
problem did I face in the keyboard?

3939
02:18:56,750 --> 02:18:57,750
That literally, they removed the letters and
put a space bar in between.

3940
02:18:57,750 --> 02:18:59,080
That means,
I have to bring a learning curve.

3941
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:08,179
If I have to start using the keyboard, then
I have to get used to that my space bar will

3942
02:19:08,179 --> 02:19:09,179
be in between the letters.

3943
02:19:09,179 --> 02:19:10,429
Where there should be a B, there is a space
bar.

3944
02:19:10,429 --> 02:19:11,429
No problem.

3945
02:19:11,429 --> 02:19:13,950
And when I saw other things, that phone only
asks for learning curves.

3946
02:19:13,950 --> 02:19:16,889
It says, first learn how to use it.

3947
02:19:16,889 --> 02:19:17,889
But...

3948
02:19:17,889 --> 02:19:22,080
In that,
BBOS, which has a passport, in that, if you

3949
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:26,870
swipe to the side, at the same place, there
are WhatsApp threads, chatting threads,

3950
02:19:26,870 --> 02:19:28,520
Facebook threads, and email, and text.

3951
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:29,900
Everything is on one side.

3952
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:31,429
But I heard that...

3953
02:19:31,429 --> 02:19:33,450
It was such an amazing thing.

3954
02:19:33,450 --> 02:19:35,809
But I heard that
APK didn't work.

3955
02:19:35,809 --> 02:19:37,660
It used to work at that time.

3956
02:19:37,660 --> 02:19:39,120
It used to work in the beginning.

3957
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:42,860
When the transition happened, there was a
solution by

3958
02:19:42,860 --> 02:19:44,780
adding Amazon's app store.

3959
02:19:44,780 --> 02:19:46,940
But only to a certain time.

3960
02:19:46,940 --> 02:19:49,460
You know what happened to my passport?

3961
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:51,620
I'll tell you my incident story.

3962
02:19:51,620 --> 02:19:52,690
My passport was...

3963
02:19:52,690 --> 02:19:53,790
It's a square device.

3964
02:19:53,790 --> 02:19:56,350
From the bottom, it has a sharp edge device.

3965
02:19:56,350 --> 02:19:58,320
I kept it on the table like this.

3966
02:19:58,320 --> 02:20:00,120
And it fell like this.

3967
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:02,641
This was the distance that it fell.

3968
02:20:02,641 --> 02:20:03,890
And the screen was...

3969
02:20:03,890 --> 02:20:05,240
It was worst product.

3970
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:06,580
Otherwise, it was good.

3971
02:20:06,580 --> 02:20:09,939
So, obviously,
I also don't buy a lot of tech.

3972
02:20:09,939 --> 02:20:11,350
I don't have lakhs.

3973
02:20:11,350 --> 02:20:14,319
But, what I picked up recently was a backbone
one.

3974
02:20:14,319 --> 02:20:16,630
It's a controller that you attach to your
phone.

3975
02:20:16,630 --> 02:20:17,630
I mean...

3976
02:20:17,630 --> 02:20:18,630
I'm very interested in gaming.

3977
02:20:18,630 --> 02:20:20,530
So, I don't get time to play the PS5.

3978
02:20:20,530 --> 02:20:23,280
So, even in iPhone 15, you can play all the
games.

3979
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:25,180
I mean, Resident Evil is already out there.

3980
02:20:25,180 --> 02:20:26,910
So, I wanted to play that.

3981
02:20:26,910 --> 02:20:29,420
And a lot of Indies that I wanted to play.

3982
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:30,420
So, best purchase ever.

3983
02:20:30,420 --> 02:20:31,729
Because I got a good 50% off.

3984
02:20:31,729 --> 02:20:32,729
I got it for 5000.

3985
02:20:32,729 --> 02:20:33,729
I was damn happy.

3986
02:20:33,729 --> 02:20:34,729
Worst purchase was an audio product.

3987
02:20:34,729 --> 02:20:35,729
I'm an audiophile.

3988
02:20:35,729 --> 02:20:36,729
So, I spend money on audio products.

3989
02:20:36,729 --> 02:20:37,729
So, there was a
Fiio FH5.

3990
02:20:37,729 --> 02:20:38,729
So, it was such an impulsive purchase.

3991
02:20:38,729 --> 02:20:39,729
It was so bass heavy.

3992
02:20:39,729 --> 02:20:42,490
I didn't like it at all.

3993
02:20:42,490 --> 02:20:43,840
I don't know what to do.

3994
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:44,840
Which one?

3995
02:20:44,840 --> 02:20:45,840
Fiio FH5.

3996
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:46,840
It's an audiophile.

3997
02:20:46,840 --> 02:20:47,840
How much is it?

3998
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:48,840
I got it for about 19-20 thousand.

3999
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:49,840
And this backbone controller?

4000
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:50,840
Is it Bluetooth or you have to connect it?

4001
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:53,569
No, it's a it's like a type C one.

4002
02:20:53,569 --> 02:20:54,569
Right?

4003
02:20:54,569 --> 02:20:56,340
So, it gets it attaches to your thing.

4004
02:20:56,340 --> 02:20:57,340
Your phone.

4005
02:20:57,340 --> 02:20:58,340
Any phone.

4006
02:20:58,340 --> 02:20:59,340
But he keeps playing that.

4007
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:00,340
So, yeah.

4008
02:21:00,340 --> 02:21:01,340
I love it.

4009
02:21:01,340 --> 02:21:02,340
Okay.

4010
02:21:02,340 --> 02:21:03,340
I have two best.

4011
02:21:03,340 --> 02:21:04,340
One is just like he said, the pocket the pocket
3 DJI.

4012
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:05,340
And another one is

4013
02:21:05,340 --> 02:21:06,340
TWS which is called
Moondrop Space Travel.

4014
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:07,340
It costs around like 25 dollars.

4015
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:11,040
I think you can import here also 3000 rupees
or something.

4016
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:14,920
Very good stuff for that price.

4017
02:21:14,920 --> 02:21:16,790
Worst will be
Sony Xperia 1 Mark 5.

4018
02:21:16,790 --> 02:21:17,790
That phone.

4019
02:21:17,790 --> 02:21:18,790
Okay.

4020
02:21:18,790 --> 02:21:19,790
You bought it?

4021
02:21:19,790 --> 02:21:20,790
The problem
He buys a lot of it.

4022
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:24,500
The problem with Sony in my experience the
last Xperia 1 Mark 1 2, 3, 4, 5 is that they

4023
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:25,640
are having good hardware.

4024
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:27,420
But Sony didn't learn computational photography.

4025
02:21:27,420 --> 02:21:28,420
Yeah.

4026
02:21:28,420 --> 02:21:29,420
So camera sensor is good.

4027
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:30,420
Everything is good.

4028
02:21:30,420 --> 02:21:32,340
But when you click photos there was no night
mode.

4029
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:33,370
Now there is night mode.

4030
02:21:33,370 --> 02:21:37,310
So what Google,
Samsung, Apple have been doing over the years

4031
02:21:37,310 --> 02:21:39,561
Sony didn't latch on to the computational
photography.

4032
02:21:39,561 --> 02:21:42,880
And that's why the photos and videos are very
bad.

4033
02:21:42,880 --> 02:21:43,880
Alright.

4034
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:44,880
B-Bomb.

4035
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:47,630
The best purchase is actually
we bought a speaker for one of our videos.

4036
02:21:47,630 --> 02:21:48,630
It was lyric speaker.

4037
02:21:48,630 --> 02:21:49,890
Whatever you play
Hindi, English, Punjabi anything.

4038
02:21:49,890 --> 02:21:53,240
It will start the lyrics and lyrics will come
in the style

4039
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:55,010
of the mood of the song.

4040
02:21:55,010 --> 02:21:56,640
And it's a really nice thing.

4041
02:21:56,640 --> 02:21:59,939
And I kept it in my home and I enjoy it.

4042
02:21:59,939 --> 02:22:01,439
It's a nice motivational starter.

4043
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:04,140
Worst actually there will be a lot of worst.

4044
02:22:04,140 --> 02:22:05,851
Team actually purchases a lot of stuff.

4045
02:22:05,851 --> 02:22:07,200
They don't tell me the worst.

4046
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:08,200
That is for sure.

4047
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:09,819
So I am not sure about the worst but that
was the best.

4048
02:22:09,819 --> 02:22:10,819
The storeroom is full of worst products.

4049
02:22:10,819 --> 02:22:11,819
Yes, it is.

4050
02:22:11,819 --> 02:22:12,819
Alright, Tavel.

4051
02:22:12,819 --> 02:22:13,819
So my best tip would be two things.

4052
02:22:13,819 --> 02:22:14,819
One is hardware side.

4053
02:22:14,819 --> 02:22:15,819
I bought a new
Insta360 for 360.

4054
02:22:15,819 --> 02:22:19,380
Just take it in your hand and you can cover
everything.

4055
02:22:19,380 --> 02:22:25,680
You don't have to like for vlogging every
time take out the phone or the camera and

4056
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:26,680
talk.

4057
02:22:26,680 --> 02:22:29,160
You can give the voice over suggestions.

4058
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:30,470
Enjoy the moment.

4059
02:22:30,470 --> 02:22:31,470
That one.

4060
02:22:31,470 --> 02:22:32,870
And the second thing is software.

4061
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:37,569
After paying a lot of amount for
Sony Resolve for one time that was the best

4062
02:22:37,569 --> 02:22:38,569
decision and

4063
02:22:38,569 --> 02:22:39,569
the best software for editing.

4064
02:22:39,569 --> 02:22:40,569
Worst?

4065
02:22:40,569 --> 02:22:41,569
Worst is a smart ring.

4066
02:22:41,569 --> 02:22:45,480
I bought it for 10k and it is not worth it.

4067
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:46,480
Which?

4068
02:22:46,480 --> 02:22:47,480
Which?

4069
02:22:47,480 --> 02:22:48,480
Which?

4070
02:22:48,480 --> 02:22:49,480
Vodka.

4071
02:22:49,480 --> 02:22:50,480
Vodka.

4072
02:22:50,480 --> 02:22:51,480
I thought something from abroad.

4073
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:52,480
Sleep tracking was not on to the point.

4074
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:53,480
Because we used to wear it.

4075
02:22:53,480 --> 02:22:54,480
The least thing
No, this was my engagement ring.

4076
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:55,480
The least thing
That was the best one.

4077
02:22:55,480 --> 02:22:57,300
Sorry guys,
I am going to interrupt.

4078
02:22:57,300 --> 02:23:04,061
Should we do a do a thumbnail
I will have to leave.

4079
02:23:04,061 --> 02:23:06,250
Thank you so much
Thank you for coming.

4080
02:23:06,250 --> 02:23:07,570
This was fantastic.

4081
02:23:07,570 --> 02:23:08,570
Thank you.

4082
02:23:08,570 --> 02:23:09,570
Great, great.

4083
02:23:09,570 --> 02:23:10,570
Great initiative.

4084
02:23:10,570 --> 02:23:11,570
See you.

4085
02:23:11,570 --> 02:23:12,570
Bye Shlok.

4086
02:23:12,570 --> 02:23:13,570
Bye bye.

4087
02:23:13,570 --> 02:23:14,570
Take care.

4088
02:23:14,570 --> 02:23:15,570
Good to see you.

4089
02:23:15,570 --> 02:23:17,740
Good to see you.

4090
02:23:17,740 --> 02:23:19,359
We will sit and chat for sure.

4091
02:23:19,359 --> 02:23:20,359
Okay.

4092
02:23:20,359 --> 02:23:21,359
Thanks.

4093
02:23:21,359 --> 02:23:22,359
Great initiative.

4094
02:23:22,359 --> 02:23:23,359
Lots of hard work.

4095
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:24,359
Good to meet you.

4096
02:23:24,359 --> 02:23:25,359
Thank you.

4097
02:23:25,359 --> 02:23:26,359
Nice to meet you.

4098
02:23:26,359 --> 02:23:27,359
We'll catch up again.

4099
02:23:27,359 --> 02:23:28,359
Nice to see you.

4100
02:23:28,359 --> 02:23:29,359
We'll also sit and chat at some point.

4101
02:23:29,359 --> 02:23:30,359
Definitely, sir.

4102
02:23:30,359 --> 02:23:31,359
Good meeting up.

4103
02:23:31,359 --> 02:23:32,359
Best of luck.

4104
02:23:32,359 --> 02:23:33,359
I wanted to ask this question.

4105
02:23:33,359 --> 02:23:34,359
How do you guys take care of your health?

4106
02:23:34,359 --> 02:23:35,359
So, I really want to know.

4107
02:23:35,359 --> 02:23:37,580
Because, 2023, for me, I have focused on health
like crazy.

4108
02:23:37,580 --> 02:23:40,771
Because, till last year, I was just going
mad literally, working, working.

4109
02:23:40,771 --> 02:23:45,149
But, since I started focusing on health, it
helped me in my work as well.

4110
02:23:45,149 --> 02:23:48,760
I find myself getting even more free time
now.

4111
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:50,740
I don't know how.

4112
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:52,720
My productivity has increased.

4113
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:54,090
What has happened?

4114
02:23:54,090 --> 02:23:55,890
My mind is in a better space.

4115
02:23:55,890 --> 02:23:57,229
But, what about your health?

4116
02:23:57,229 --> 02:23:58,229
What is your...

4117
02:23:58,229 --> 02:24:01,779
In my opinion, because I have been part of
this biohacking community and all.

4118
02:24:01,779 --> 02:24:05,850
Till now, we used to think that we have to
live for 60-70 years.

4119
02:24:05,850 --> 02:24:07,479
It's like, okay, let's live.

4120
02:24:07,479 --> 02:24:08,479
We'll grow old.

4121
02:24:08,479 --> 02:24:15,920
All the people I have met, who are part of
this community, who are working on top tier

4122
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:16,920
technologies, age reversal.

4123
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:21,240
A few years from now, or the technologies
that are still there, you can live for 100-150

4124
02:24:21,240 --> 02:24:22,240
years.

4125
02:24:22,240 --> 02:24:23,620
I mean, you can live through them.

4126
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:26,070
And, it's not just that you'll be able to
live.

4127
02:24:26,070 --> 02:24:28,020
You can live like a 30-year-old healthy person.

4128
02:24:28,020 --> 02:24:29,020
80-90 years.

4129
02:24:29,020 --> 02:24:30,020
And, I think...

4130
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:31,020
You can have an active lifestyle.

4131
02:24:31,020 --> 02:24:32,020
Hiking.

4132
02:24:32,020 --> 02:24:33,020
Cycling.

4133
02:24:33,020 --> 02:24:34,020
And, So, what you're doing?

4134
02:24:34,020 --> 02:24:35,020
You're doing something like that?

4135
02:24:35,020 --> 02:24:36,020
Yes, 100%.

4136
02:24:36,020 --> 02:24:38,720
There are a lot of machines.

4137
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:41,430
There are a lot of things.

4138
02:24:41,430 --> 02:24:42,970
Like, it is diet.

4139
02:24:42,970 --> 02:24:44,320
There are machines.

4140
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:45,320
There are technologies.

4141
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:50,140
Like, for example, right now, it happens that
most people are deficient in something.

4142
02:24:50,140 --> 02:24:54,779
And, as I'm doing scientist research,
I'm finding out that everything is because

4143
02:24:54,779 --> 02:24:55,910
of a deficiency.

4144
02:24:55,910 --> 02:25:01,280
If you're not eating properly, your pancreas
doesn't function properly, and you develop

4145
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:02,280
diabetes.

4146
02:25:02,280 --> 02:25:04,890
If you're not eating properly, eventually,
you develop cancer.

4147
02:25:04,890 --> 02:25:10,120
And, research has been done, clinically proven,
that if you keep eating certain things throughout

4148
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:15,100
your life, you won't develop diabetes, you
won't develop cancer, and you won't get sick.

4149
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:16,630
And, there are supplements.

4150
02:25:16,630 --> 02:25:18,550
There are supplements for everything.

4151
02:25:18,550 --> 02:25:20,470
There are supplements for treatment.

4152
02:25:20,470 --> 02:25:22,760
I was just looking at it.

4153
02:25:22,760 --> 02:25:24,970
You were eating so many...

4154
02:25:24,970 --> 02:25:27,620
How many tablets do you eat?

4155
02:25:27,620 --> 02:25:28,620
Supplements.

4156
02:25:28,620 --> 02:25:29,620
I...

4157
02:25:29,620 --> 02:25:30,620
Tablets are like...

4158
02:25:30,620 --> 02:25:35,069
It might sound a little weird that I eat 20-22
tablets a

4159
02:25:35,069 --> 02:25:36,069
day.

4160
02:25:36,069 --> 02:25:38,100
But, those tablets are like, turmeric powder,
neem powder, Okay.

4161
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:39,200
There's some fish oil.

4162
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:41,130
So, it's a very basic supplement type.

4163
02:25:41,130 --> 02:25:42,130
They're not medicines.

4164
02:25:42,130 --> 02:25:43,130
But, they are.

4165
02:25:43,130 --> 02:25:44,130
They're supplements.

4166
02:25:44,130 --> 02:25:46,840
And, they've developed a lot now.

4167
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:52,590
They've refined a lot.

4168
02:25:52,590 --> 02:26:02,490
And, the second thing is that there are such
technologies that you can use in your body

4169
02:26:02,490 --> 02:26:03,729
while exercising naturally.

4170
02:26:03,729 --> 02:26:06,220
For example, there's a body suit.

4171
02:26:06,220 --> 02:26:11,649
If you wear that and work out for half an
hour, it is like working out for 4 hours.

4172
02:26:11,649 --> 02:26:15,470
So, if you wear that and do normal work, you'll
basically have a workout session.

4173
02:26:15,470 --> 02:26:17,430
And, there's a machine, it's called a sculptor.

4174
02:26:17,430 --> 02:26:19,420
In that, there are electrical simulations
in the body.

4175
02:26:19,420 --> 02:26:23,220
So, if you put it on your stomach, within
half an hour, you can do around 20,000 push-ups.

4176
02:26:23,220 --> 02:26:24,220
And, the body basically does this.

4177
02:26:24,220 --> 02:26:25,380
The body has electrical signals.

4178
02:26:25,380 --> 02:26:27,480
So, the muscles contract, and contract, and
contract.

4179
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:28,480
It happens very quickly.

4180
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:29,480
And, it hurts.

4181
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:30,480
But, all these things work.

4182
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:31,680
Because, I did 7 sessions of the sculptor.

4183
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:32,680
And, my abs got a little better.

4184
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:33,680
And, Only in 7 sessions?

4185
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:34,680
Yes, 7 sessions.

4186
02:26:34,680 --> 02:26:35,680
But, it is painful.

4187
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:36,680
We all want to see your abs.

4188
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:37,680
It's not there yet.

4189
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:38,680
No, no, no.

4190
02:26:38,680 --> 02:26:41,070
But, as soon as it comes,
As soon as it comes, first of all, for you.

4191
02:26:41,070 --> 02:26:42,720
But, I'm getting that moment from the Nayak
movie.

4192
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:44,210
I'm like, he's trapped.

4193
02:26:44,210 --> 02:26:46,439
But, it is like an experiment.

4194
02:26:46,439 --> 02:26:48,660
It might work, it might not.

4195
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:51,000
So, you're doing a lot of biohacking.

4196
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:52,000
And, health.

4197
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,000
So, you're focusing on that.

4198
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:54,620
Yes, there are some other people with whom
I'm connected.

4199
02:26:54,620 --> 02:26:55,950
And, they're on the same path.

4200
02:26:55,950 --> 02:27:01,050
Now, I think, as far as I'm concerned,
I have a lot of faith in science and this

4201
02:27:01,050 --> 02:27:02,050
community.

4202
02:27:02,050 --> 02:27:03,050
And, the output I've seen for my body, it's
very positive.

4203
02:27:03,050 --> 02:27:04,050
So, I'll do it and see.

4204
02:27:04,050 --> 02:27:05,050
And, we'll know.

4205
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:06,050
We'll know.

4206
02:27:06,050 --> 02:27:07,050
And, videos are coming.

4207
02:27:07,050 --> 02:27:08,050
Yes, videos are coming.

4208
02:27:08,050 --> 02:27:09,050
I did something in between.

4209
02:27:09,050 --> 02:27:10,050
I saw the thumbnail,
I didn't see the video.

4210
02:27:10,050 --> 02:27:11,050
That's testing.

4211
02:27:11,050 --> 02:27:12,050
Testing.

4212
02:27:12,050 --> 02:27:13,050
Basically, I think, it's a very simple philosophy.

4213
02:27:13,050 --> 02:27:17,610
To improve health, even in an uneven business,
the thing you can measure, you can improve

4214
02:27:17,610 --> 02:27:18,610
that.

4215
02:27:18,610 --> 02:27:24,771
So, if you take a blood test, you can measure
vitamin D, A, B, C, whatever comes, you can

4216
02:27:24,771 --> 02:27:25,771
measure everything.

4217
02:27:25,771 --> 02:27:29,770
Similarly, if you measure your lungs, your
stomach, your pancreas, you can measure everything

4218
02:27:29,770 --> 02:27:32,550
and you'll know that these things in your
body are bad.

4219
02:27:32,550 --> 02:27:34,770
And, if you track that and keep improving
it, so,

4220
02:27:34,770 --> 02:27:36,229
basically, your body will also improve.

4221
02:27:36,229 --> 02:27:41,189
And, as it improves, you have a biological
age, which is called the rate of aging.

4222
02:27:41,189 --> 02:27:43,460
If you live for a year, then most people,
if they're eating

4223
02:27:43,460 --> 02:27:45,520
bad food, if they're not exercising, they
reduce their age.

4224
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:48,080
So, after living for a year, they're dragging
their lives

4225
02:27:48,080 --> 02:27:49,080
for two years.

4226
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:52,689
So, if you reduce that, 0.5, 0.3, so, basically,
your rate

4227
02:27:52,689 --> 02:27:57,840
of aging, if you live for a year, so, basically,
in that year, you only spent three months.

4228
02:27:57,840 --> 02:28:02,290
So, if you live for a year, then your one
year will end.

4229
02:28:02,290 --> 02:28:04,680
So, you can live for 150 years.

4230
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:07,069
A lot of biohacking going on here.

4231
02:28:07,069 --> 02:28:10,830
And, I'll add one more thing to this, that,
sitting in

4232
02:28:10,830 --> 02:28:14,700
India, we think that all these things are
not common.

4233
02:28:14,700 --> 02:28:20,030
That, in 70 years, who is tracking and whose
abs are there?

4234
02:28:20,030 --> 02:28:25,190
But, there is a country like this in the world,
there is a country in Okinawa, Japan.

4235
02:28:25,190 --> 02:28:28,130
There, it is common that 80-90 years old people
have blue zones.

4236
02:28:28,130 --> 02:28:29,130
Blue zones.

4237
02:28:29,130 --> 02:28:30,590
And, tracking and living a very healthy lifestyle.

4238
02:28:30,590 --> 02:28:32,300
So, this is possible from the beginning.

4239
02:28:32,300 --> 02:28:34,020
But, by breaking it down, scientifically,
yes,

4240
02:28:34,020 --> 02:28:35,870
scientifically, it is being given.

4241
02:28:35,870 --> 02:28:38,220
And, I think, this is the future.

4242
02:28:38,220 --> 02:28:39,220
And, people will live for 150 years.

4243
02:28:39,220 --> 02:28:40,220
But, it takes a lot of money now.

4244
02:28:40,220 --> 02:28:41,220
Okay, I have a question for this.

4245
02:28:41,220 --> 02:28:43,920
So, you told me your diet is the main thing,
right?

4246
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:48,790
So, do you prefer foods that are only like
raw fruits and veggies, that thing?

4247
02:28:48,790 --> 02:28:52,890
Or, what are the impurities that we usually
have in our daily, day-to-day foods?

4248
02:28:52,890 --> 02:28:56,729
Like, in flour, even in that,
what do you do with that?

4249
02:28:56,729 --> 02:29:02,350
So, I have a lot,
I mean, we can't do anything about it.

4250
02:29:02,350 --> 02:29:04,100
We do what we can.

4251
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:05,530
That's why I am asking.

4252
02:29:05,530 --> 02:29:08,160
Because, you went to Chennai and did all the
testings and everything.

4253
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:10,859
They can tell you that you eat half a kg of
this, of

4254
02:29:10,859 --> 02:29:12,641
fruits, or 100 grams of this.

4255
02:29:12,641 --> 02:29:14,550
Those things you can.

4256
02:29:14,550 --> 02:29:17,569
But, the impurities in your food, which we
can't see directly.

4257
02:29:17,569 --> 02:29:20,109
But, it is like, do you have any solutions?

4258
02:29:20,109 --> 02:29:24,330
Of course, in living in this society, sitting
here, we

4259
02:29:24,330 --> 02:29:27,601
might have smoked 5 cigarettes.

4260
02:29:27,601 --> 02:29:29,170
Because, this is Delhi.

4261
02:29:29,170 --> 02:29:31,440
So, we can't do anything about that.

4262
02:29:31,440 --> 02:29:33,061
For that, you can shift.

4263
02:29:33,061 --> 02:29:34,580
Maybe, you can shift to Kerala.

4264
02:29:34,580 --> 02:29:38,540
There, the impurities will be less.

4265
02:29:38,540 --> 02:29:40,970
So, that is what
I will also do.

4266
02:29:40,970 --> 02:29:42,960
You are planning to do.

4267
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:46,130
He is planning to shift to your city.

4268
02:29:46,130 --> 02:29:47,320
I am planning.

4269
02:29:47,320 --> 02:29:49,930
I think, to what extent you can go to, that
depends.

4270
02:29:49,930 --> 02:29:52,000
For example, there is a guy named Brian Johnson.

4271
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,529
He doesn't leave his house.

4272
02:29:53,529 --> 02:29:55,069
He cooks his own food.

4273
02:29:55,069 --> 02:29:56,300
He does everything himself.

4274
02:29:56,300 --> 02:29:59,069
So, what is the use of cooking at home?

4275
02:29:59,069 --> 02:30:01,900
But, he experiments on himself and does it
for us.

4276
02:30:01,900 --> 02:30:04,300
No, I just wanted to know.

4277
02:30:04,300 --> 02:30:06,740
Because, he is the king of biohacking.

4278
02:30:06,740 --> 02:30:08,939
He understood the whole technology.

4279
02:30:08,939 --> 02:30:12,100
You come up in farms.

4280
02:30:12,100 --> 02:30:16,370
You stay where there are a lot of farms.

4281
02:30:16,370 --> 02:30:18,681
So, you must be getting pure.

4282
02:30:18,681 --> 02:30:19,979
No, no, no.

4283
02:30:19,979 --> 02:30:21,550
Impurities is all the way.

4284
02:30:21,550 --> 02:30:26,970
Because, even while seeding itself, they use
the pesticides and everything.

4285
02:30:26,970 --> 02:30:27,970
They grow the fruits.

4286
02:30:27,970 --> 02:30:29,200
Do you do any exercises?

4287
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:30,200
Nothing.

4288
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:31,200
Nothing?

4289
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:32,200
And, you stay fit like this.

4290
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:33,200
No, I was not fit.

4291
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:37,510
Like, when we met 4 or 5 months ago, you told
me about it.

4292
02:30:37,510 --> 02:30:39,420
Before, when we met in China.

4293
02:30:39,420 --> 02:30:42,149
After that, when I came to Pune.

4294
02:30:42,149 --> 02:30:44,390
Because, that's what
I was about to speak actually.

4295
02:30:44,390 --> 02:30:45,430
Physical health and mental health.

4296
02:30:45,430 --> 02:30:47,000
Both are big things for creators.

4297
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,859
So, I keep on running in the morning and day.

4298
02:30:49,859 --> 02:30:50,859
In and out.

4299
02:30:50,859 --> 02:30:52,000
Because, I have to oversee everything.

4300
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,940
Until you have a good team, you have to do
everything.

4301
02:30:54,940 --> 02:30:57,439
Which we usually do for the past 8 years.

4302
02:30:57,439 --> 02:30:59,640
Then, mental health with all the negativities
happening around you and a lot of things that

4303
02:30:59,640 --> 02:31:01,029
is going around you personally and professionally.

4304
02:31:01,029 --> 02:31:03,819
So, managing these things was my priority
this particular year.

4305
02:31:03,819 --> 02:31:04,819
Going forward, it will change.

4306
02:31:04,819 --> 02:31:06,900
Because, after having a lot of discussion
and a lot of

4307
02:31:06,900 --> 02:31:08,560
I got to take a lot of things in my mind.

4308
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:09,560
Awesome.

4309
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:10,560
Kanchit bhai.

4310
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:11,560
So, I have a lot of perspective about health.

4311
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:12,560
Especially, creators.

4312
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:13,560
What are you doing?

4313
02:31:13,560 --> 02:31:14,560
I will tell you what I am doing.

4314
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:15,560
I will give context behind it.

4315
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:16,560
Shlok told the tech side.

4316
02:31:16,560 --> 02:31:17,560
I will tell the emotional side.

4317
02:31:17,560 --> 02:31:24,130
I have this problem that I have to take a
lot of stress in the initial days.

4318
02:31:24,130 --> 02:31:28,950
So, stress level increases and stress is also
mental obviously.

4319
02:31:28,950 --> 02:31:30,400
We don't know.

4320
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:35,230
We seriously don't know what stress is, what
anxiety is,

4321
02:31:35,230 --> 02:31:36,680
what depression is.

4322
02:31:36,680 --> 02:31:38,890
All three things are different.

4323
02:31:38,890 --> 02:31:40,680
But, we think these are words.

4324
02:31:40,680 --> 02:31:42,380
But, it is not exactly like that.

4325
02:31:42,380 --> 02:31:44,529
There is a different story behind everything.

4326
02:31:44,529 --> 02:31:48,340
So, I was in stress and I was taking a lot
of milk.

4327
02:31:48,340 --> 02:31:50,130
Obviously, it is expensive.

4328
02:31:50,130 --> 02:31:54,660
After that, suddenly, I was not able to digest
protein.

4329
02:31:54,660 --> 02:31:57,279
Then, there were a lot of proteins like lentils,
chicken.

4330
02:31:57,279 --> 02:31:58,910
So, I was taking a lot of protein.

4331
02:31:58,910 --> 02:32:01,340
Then, I was taking a lot of milk.

4332
02:32:01,340 --> 02:32:04,990
Then, I was taking a lot of protein.

4333
02:32:04,990 --> 02:32:07,160
Then, I was taking a lot of milk.

4334
02:32:07,160 --> 02:32:09,340
Whatever it is, I'm not
able to do it.

4335
02:32:09,340 --> 02:32:11,520
All this has happened to me within 3 years.

4336
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:12,730
But what was my focus?

4337
02:32:12,730 --> 02:32:13,730
YouTube, YouTube, YouTube.

4338
02:32:13,730 --> 02:32:15,150
I'm busy with YouTube all the time.

4339
02:32:15,150 --> 02:32:16,150
So that was it.

4340
02:32:16,150 --> 02:32:17,150
I didn't
understand what was happening

4341
02:32:17,150 --> 02:32:18,150
to me.

4342
02:32:18,150 --> 02:32:20,279
I thought a bad phase of life is going on.

4343
02:32:20,279 --> 02:32:21,460
It will
be fine.

4344
02:32:21,460 --> 02:32:25,220
But then, there was a talk going on on the
podcast

4345
02:32:25,220 --> 02:32:26,220
of BRBicep.

4346
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:27,220
I keep listening to the podcast.

4347
02:32:27,220 --> 02:32:29,490
Manish Pandey, probably a lot of people know
him.

4348
02:32:29,490 --> 02:32:32,190
He does a lot for creators.

4349
02:32:32,190 --> 02:32:33,990
He's your friend, right?

4350
02:32:33,990 --> 02:32:34,990
Hmm.

4351
02:32:34,990 --> 02:32:41,100
So he once said in a conversation to someone,
I think Ranveer Alabadia must have said it,

4352
02:32:41,100 --> 02:32:42,940
that creators
don't know what the side effect of YouTube

4353
02:32:42,940 --> 02:32:43,940
is.

4354
02:32:43,940 --> 02:32:44,940
We have no idea because everything is so new.

4355
02:32:44,940 --> 02:32:46,030
Some people get hit, some don't.

4356
02:32:46,030 --> 02:32:47,390
I was unlucky that I got hit.

4357
02:32:47,390 --> 02:32:48,390
Everything.

4358
02:32:48,390 --> 02:32:49,920
So recently I was watching a podcast of Ranveer.

4359
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:51,569
Ranveer himself said that he suddenly stopped
digesting cheese.

4360
02:32:51,569 --> 02:32:52,670
I have become lactose intolerant.

4361
02:32:52,670 --> 02:32:54,880
Maybe Shlok had also said that he stopped
digesting milk.

4362
02:32:54,880 --> 02:32:56,460
I think stress is hitting creators.

4363
02:32:56,460 --> 02:32:57,790
But we don't realize it.

4364
02:32:57,790 --> 02:32:59,120
It's hitting in different ways.

4365
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:00,120
I think so.

4366
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:02,381
But I realized that I have a problem with
stress.

4367
02:33:02,381 --> 02:33:03,689
By the way, everything is fine after marriage.

4368
02:33:03,689 --> 02:33:04,689
Hahaha.

4369
02:33:04,689 --> 02:33:06,000
So, I mean,
Shlok is happy.

4370
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,000
I'm kidding.

4371
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Anyway, stress management is something.

4372
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,000
I just found out.

4373
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,870
Maybe it will work in someone's life.

4374
02:33:11,870 --> 02:33:12,950
The thing I told you.

4375
02:33:12,950 --> 02:33:17,020
But yes, stress management is a process that
should be taken in life if you have stress.

4376
02:33:17,020 --> 02:33:18,020
I learned this.

4377
02:33:18,020 --> 02:33:19,020
I'm doing it.

4378
02:33:19,020 --> 02:33:20,020
Tell me, Gaurav.

4379
02:33:20,020 --> 02:33:21,670
Your muscles are very real in the middle.

4380
02:33:21,670 --> 02:33:22,710
I can still see it.

4381
02:33:22,710 --> 02:33:23,710
No, no.

4382
02:33:23,710 --> 02:33:24,710
I have taken a little break now.

4383
02:33:24,710 --> 02:33:27,160
But I think if we just follow the basics.

4384
02:33:27,160 --> 02:33:28,160
Basics means.

4385
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:29,160
Do workout.

4386
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:30,160
Half an hour, one hour.

4387
02:33:30,160 --> 02:33:31,160
Whatever.

4388
02:33:31,160 --> 02:33:32,160
You just walk or go for a jog.

4389
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:33,220
Or lift weights or whatever.

4390
02:33:33,220 --> 02:33:34,750
Basically, there has to be a balance.

4391
02:33:34,750 --> 02:33:35,750
Between your diet.

4392
02:33:35,750 --> 02:33:36,750
Between your sleep.

4393
02:33:36,750 --> 02:33:37,750
And your workouts.

4394
02:33:37,750 --> 02:33:39,010
As long as you have those basics set right.

4395
02:33:39,010 --> 02:33:40,570
You are going to the gym.

4396
02:33:40,570 --> 02:33:41,570
You are sweating.

4397
02:33:41,570 --> 02:33:42,570
You are jogging.

4398
02:33:42,570 --> 02:33:43,570
And you are sweating.

4399
02:33:43,570 --> 02:33:44,570
I think it drains all the negative energy.

4400
02:33:44,570 --> 02:33:45,570
It freshens you up.

4401
02:33:45,570 --> 02:33:48,330
If you wake up in the morning and do workout.

4402
02:33:48,330 --> 02:33:51,380
For the rest of the day, you are completely
charged.

4403
02:33:51,380 --> 02:33:52,590
You will be charged.

4404
02:33:52,590 --> 02:33:54,120
Good thoughts will come.

4405
02:33:54,120 --> 02:33:55,840
You will do the work well.

4406
02:33:55,840 --> 02:33:56,840
It's a loop.

4407
02:33:56,840 --> 02:33:57,840
It's a positive loop that you go into.

4408
02:33:57,840 --> 02:33:59,650
As long as you are maintaining a balance.

4409
02:33:59,650 --> 02:34:00,650
I mean.

4410
02:34:00,650 --> 02:34:03,029
You are partying for a day in a week.

4411
02:34:03,029 --> 02:34:05,020
But do you know that the next day.

4412
02:34:05,020 --> 02:34:06,240
I will have to balance what I ate last night.

4413
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:08,960
I am taking out the waste here for two hours.

4414
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:10,189
So as long as you have a balance.

4415
02:34:10,189 --> 02:34:11,189
It should be fine.

4416
02:34:11,189 --> 02:34:14,149
I am not the person who will be like that
in any case.

4417
02:34:14,149 --> 02:34:17,600
I will lock myself in the house like a normal
person.

4418
02:34:17,600 --> 02:34:19,021
I am not like that.

4419
02:34:19,021 --> 02:34:21,521
Or for example, Shlok did his research.

4420
02:34:21,521 --> 02:34:22,521
I won't go that extreme.

4421
02:34:22,521 --> 02:34:25,040
I think as long as I am able to do the basics.

4422
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:27,020
It's a good enough thing.

4423
02:34:27,020 --> 02:34:29,870
And at least to start with.

4424
02:34:29,870 --> 02:34:31,430
You have to do that.

4425
02:34:31,430 --> 02:34:33,070
The rest is on top of it.

4426
02:34:33,070 --> 02:34:35,540
By the way, I will share a few things.

4427
02:34:35,540 --> 02:34:36,670
Because we were talking about this.

4428
02:34:36,670 --> 02:34:37,770
So I had the same problem.

4429
02:34:37,770 --> 02:34:39,390
With a lack of some vitamins.

4430
02:34:39,390 --> 02:34:40,390
You get depressed.

4431
02:34:40,390 --> 02:34:41,550
I mean if you are deficient in some vitamins.

4432
02:34:41,550 --> 02:34:42,800
I think there are some vitamins of B.
For a period of two to three years.

4433
02:34:42,800 --> 02:34:43,800
You will get depressed.

4434
02:34:43,800 --> 02:34:44,800
You will get anxiety attacks.

4435
02:34:44,800 --> 02:34:45,800
And with vitamin D, you lose sleep.

4436
02:34:45,800 --> 02:34:46,800
For example, I didn't have any protein left.

4437
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:47,800
With the supplementation of B1 and B12.

4438
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:48,990
I am able to digest protein well now.

4439
02:34:48,990 --> 02:34:49,990
So I think.

4440
02:34:49,990 --> 02:34:52,569
I mean if we look at food a little consciously.

4441
02:34:52,569 --> 02:34:54,050
I mean it's not necessary.

4442
02:34:54,050 --> 02:34:56,029
You have to take a tablet.

4443
02:34:56,029 --> 02:34:57,050
It's in nutritional yeast.

4444
02:34:57,050 --> 02:34:58,319
It's in egg or something.

4445
02:34:58,319 --> 02:34:59,340
By supplementing all that.

4446
02:34:59,340 --> 02:35:00,620
If you are eating properly.

4447
02:35:00,620 --> 02:35:01,640
You can stop depression.

4448
02:35:01,640 --> 02:35:02,910
It's possible that anxiety attacks.

4449
02:35:02,910 --> 02:35:03,910
Stress.

4450
02:35:03,910 --> 02:35:04,950
If you can stop all these things.

4451
02:35:04,950 --> 02:35:06,399
I am saying what happens is.

4452
02:35:06,399 --> 02:35:07,399
Basically, in this creator space.

4453
02:35:07,399 --> 02:35:09,069
Because of the priorities set towards that.

4454
02:35:09,069 --> 02:35:10,290
Everything else takes a toll.

4455
02:35:10,290 --> 02:35:11,399
You won't be able to sleep on time.

4456
02:35:11,399 --> 02:35:12,529
Eating and drinking will be random.

4457
02:35:12,529 --> 02:35:13,529
You travel a lot.

4458
02:35:13,529 --> 02:35:15,320
Because of that, the routine is not set.

4459
02:35:15,320 --> 02:35:16,320
So it gets affected.

4460
02:35:16,320 --> 02:35:19,420
Whether you see it in a year.

4461
02:35:19,420 --> 02:35:21,520
Or in two years.

4462
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:22,750
Or in five years.

4463
02:35:22,750 --> 02:35:24,880
Depending on how long your body can tolerate
that thing.

4464
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:26,180
Sometimes you will get the result.

4465
02:35:26,180 --> 02:35:28,800
So I think because of the kind of burnouts.

4466
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:29,800
You are facing.

4467
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:31,410
Or you are too much engrossed into just your.

4468
02:35:31,410 --> 02:35:32,410
Like creating thing.

4469
02:35:32,410 --> 02:35:34,350
So I think a balance is necessary for that
thing.

4470
02:35:34,350 --> 02:35:35,620
As long as it's balanced.

4471
02:35:35,620 --> 02:35:36,620
To start with.

4472
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:37,689
That should happen.

4473
02:35:37,689 --> 02:35:39,210
If that doesn't happen.

4474
02:35:39,210 --> 02:35:41,470
Then its negative will definitely happen.

4475
02:35:41,470 --> 02:35:42,470
Irshad.

4476
02:35:42,470 --> 02:35:43,470
Tell me.

4477
02:35:43,470 --> 02:35:44,470
I am seeing the journey.

4478
02:35:44,470 --> 02:35:45,470
Right in front of you.

4479
02:35:45,470 --> 02:35:46,470
He has lost something like 15 kgs.

4480
02:35:46,470 --> 02:35:47,729
Now he is on his way.

4481
02:35:47,729 --> 02:35:48,990
Yeah, so bad eating habits.

4482
02:35:48,990 --> 02:35:49,990
I mean because.

4483
02:35:49,990 --> 02:35:51,000
Eating happens due to stress.

4484
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:52,000
You know.

4485
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Eat anything.

4486
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:54,240
And never cared about health.

4487
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,470
I obviously play a lot of cricket.

4488
02:35:55,470 --> 02:35:56,470
And like you know.

4489
02:35:56,470 --> 02:35:57,470
We started playing cricket in office.

4490
02:35:57,470 --> 02:35:58,470
Okay.

4491
02:35:58,470 --> 02:35:59,470
Yeah, so I have also ensured.

4492
02:35:59,470 --> 02:36:00,550
That the whole team on Saturday.

4493
02:36:00,550 --> 02:36:01,680
Every Saturday we play cricket.

4494
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:02,680
So.

4495
02:36:02,680 --> 02:36:03,680
Very proper.

4496
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:04,680
I couldn't run.

4497
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:05,680
And I am like.

4498
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:06,680
This is not me.

4499
02:36:06,680 --> 02:36:07,680
Like this is not me.

4500
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:08,680
Like you know earlier.

4501
02:36:08,680 --> 02:36:09,680
So I had to like.

4502
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:10,680
Take some changes.

4503
02:36:10,680 --> 02:36:11,680
Make some changes.

4504
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:12,680
I didn't start with exercise.

4505
02:36:12,680 --> 02:36:13,680
Obviously.

4506
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:14,680
I used to only play cricket.

4507
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:15,680
But I started intermittent fasting properly.

4508
02:36:15,680 --> 02:36:17,060
And then I cut sugar from my life.

4509
02:36:17,060 --> 02:36:18,060
I don't.

4510
02:36:18,060 --> 02:36:19,390
I don't generally prefer sugar either.

4511
02:36:19,390 --> 02:36:21,430
But sugar is not required for your body.

4512
02:36:21,430 --> 02:36:22,430
Very good advice.

4513
02:36:22,430 --> 02:36:23,430
Yeah.

4514
02:36:23,430 --> 02:36:24,430
So it's not.

4515
02:36:24,430 --> 02:36:25,430
Sugar.

4516
02:36:25,430 --> 02:36:26,430
That's the best.

4517
02:36:26,430 --> 02:36:27,430
Both of us don't eat sugar.

4518
02:36:27,430 --> 02:36:28,430
Yeah.

4519
02:36:28,430 --> 02:36:29,430
I mean additional sugars.

4520
02:36:29,430 --> 02:36:30,430
But total I mean.

4521
02:36:30,430 --> 02:36:31,430
And then also like.

4522
02:36:31,430 --> 02:36:32,430
Protein intake and everything.

4523
02:36:32,430 --> 02:36:33,430
That's not been a problem.

4524
02:36:33,430 --> 02:36:34,430
But cutting carbs.

4525
02:36:34,430 --> 02:36:35,430
All those basic things.

4526
02:36:35,430 --> 02:36:36,430
Doing those basic things.

4527
02:36:36,430 --> 02:36:37,430
It's making a difference.

4528
02:36:37,430 --> 02:36:38,430
And now I have started.

4529
02:36:38,430 --> 02:36:39,430
Proper exercising as well.

4530
02:36:39,430 --> 02:36:40,430
Which is basically walking and running.

4531
02:36:40,430 --> 02:36:41,430
So it's helping.

4532
02:36:41,430 --> 02:36:42,430
So I was 110.

4533
02:36:42,430 --> 02:36:43,430
Now I am like.

4534
02:36:43,430 --> 02:36:44,430
What?

4535
02:36:44,430 --> 02:36:45,430
Yeah.

4536
02:36:45,430 --> 02:36:46,430
Now I am like 98.

4537
02:36:46,430 --> 02:36:47,430
Yeah.

4538
02:36:47,430 --> 02:36:48,430
I was 110 at one point of time.

4539
02:36:48,430 --> 02:36:49,430
I was like literally.

4540
02:36:49,430 --> 02:36:50,430
Into YouTube space.

4541
02:36:50,430 --> 02:36:51,430
I was like.

4542
02:36:51,430 --> 02:36:52,680
I was in a very bad mental state.

4543
02:36:52,680 --> 02:36:53,680
This is common.

4544
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:54,680
Bad mental space.

4545
02:36:54,680 --> 02:36:55,680
Every YouTuber.

4546
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:56,779
It reflects into your routine.

4547
02:36:56,779 --> 02:36:57,779
That's the problem.

4548
02:36:57,779 --> 02:36:59,290
You are not in your right mind.

4549
02:36:59,290 --> 02:37:00,600
You won't be able to sleep.

4550
02:37:00,600 --> 02:37:01,660
You won't be able to sleep.

4551
02:37:01,660 --> 02:37:05,529
You won't be able to wake up the next day.

4552
02:37:05,529 --> 02:37:06,529
On time.

4553
02:37:06,529 --> 02:37:07,529
Your day.

4554
02:37:07,529 --> 02:37:08,529
So it's a loop.

4555
02:37:08,529 --> 02:37:10,601
Sir this YT creator studio app.

4556
02:37:10,601 --> 02:37:13,310
Which is showing you in real time.

4557
02:37:13,310 --> 02:37:15,970
Now 10 views have increased.

4558
02:37:15,970 --> 02:37:17,540
Now 20 have increased.

4559
02:37:17,540 --> 02:37:18,540
See.

4560
02:37:18,540 --> 02:37:19,540
Depends.

4561
02:37:19,540 --> 02:37:20,540
That's what I am saying.

4562
02:37:20,540 --> 02:37:21,899
Depends on how much you are using.

4563
02:37:21,899 --> 02:37:23,130
Then it is showing comments.

4564
02:37:23,130 --> 02:37:24,130
Then you know.

4565
02:37:24,130 --> 02:37:25,460
You are getting feedback in real time.

4566
02:37:25,460 --> 02:37:26,630
The audience is feeling bad.

4567
02:37:26,630 --> 02:37:27,630
Feeling good.

4568
02:37:27,630 --> 02:37:29,210
This is a very stressful thing.

4569
02:37:29,210 --> 02:37:32,080
Which can happen to anyone.

4570
02:37:32,080 --> 02:37:34,170
So I did.

4571
02:37:34,170 --> 02:37:42,030
Went for like a therapy session.

4572
02:37:42,030 --> 02:37:44,270
With a proper psychologist.

4573
02:37:44,270 --> 02:37:45,310
That kind of.

4574
02:37:45,310 --> 02:37:48,260
That was the initial thing.

4575
02:37:48,260 --> 02:37:49,720
Then after that I.
Does it help?

4576
02:37:49,720 --> 02:37:50,790
Yeah it does.

4577
02:37:50,790 --> 02:37:51,850
It does help.

4578
02:37:51,850 --> 02:37:52,920
It does help.

4579
02:37:52,920 --> 02:37:53,990
Yeah it does.

4580
02:37:53,990 --> 02:37:55,760
How many sessions you had?

4581
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:57,540
I had like a proper.

4582
02:37:57,540 --> 02:37:58,610
Help for you?

4583
02:37:58,610 --> 02:37:59,680
But I didn't.

4584
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:00,680
I don't believe.

4585
02:38:00,680 --> 02:38:01,680
For me it works.

4586
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:02,680
So it's fine.

4587
02:38:02,680 --> 02:38:03,680
So.

4588
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:04,680
No it's about how we perceive it.

4589
02:38:04,680 --> 02:38:05,680
They will give their input.

4590
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:06,680
Based on our.

4591
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:07,680
Whatever saying we have.

4592
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:09,080
But we need to act accordingly.

4593
02:38:09,080 --> 02:38:10,830
So it might differ person to person.

4594
02:38:10,830 --> 02:38:12,390
Yeah that is there.

4595
02:38:12,390 --> 02:38:13,520
So for me it worked.

4596
02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:14,650
And after that I decided.

4597
02:38:14,650 --> 02:38:15,650
I have to reduce my weight.

4598
02:38:15,650 --> 02:38:16,650
So.

4599
02:38:16,650 --> 02:38:17,650
No I heard a dietician.

4600
02:38:17,650 --> 02:38:18,650
I have a back issue.

4601
02:38:18,650 --> 02:38:21,300
I have a spine issue.

4602
02:38:21,300 --> 02:38:22,300
I have a slipped disc.

4603
02:38:22,300 --> 02:38:23,300
Okay.

4604
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:24,300
So I can't work out.

4605
02:38:24,300 --> 02:38:25,300
Or lift heavy stuff.

4606
02:38:25,300 --> 02:38:26,840
Or run for a very long time.

4607
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:28,270
So I have a dietician.

4608
02:38:28,270 --> 02:38:30,350
I'm still following a proper diet.

4609
02:38:30,350 --> 02:38:32,060
So that's how I reduced it to 98.

4610
02:38:32,060 --> 02:38:33,060
Still.

4611
02:38:33,060 --> 02:38:34,060
You are you are slim and trim.

4612
02:38:34,060 --> 02:38:35,540
So you do something for it.

4613
02:38:35,540 --> 02:38:36,779
Or it is all natural.

4614
02:38:36,779 --> 02:38:37,779
Multiple things.

4615
02:38:37,779 --> 02:38:39,029
I'm going to tell you that only.

4616
02:38:39,029 --> 02:38:40,029
YouTube studio.

4617
02:38:40,029 --> 02:38:41,029
Or YouTube.

4618
02:38:41,029 --> 02:38:43,370
The more stats we see on the phone.

4619
02:38:43,370 --> 02:38:44,370
The more anxiety there is.

4620
02:38:44,370 --> 02:38:45,370
And sometimes.

4621
02:38:45,370 --> 02:38:46,990
The game of views is going up and down.

4622
02:38:46,990 --> 02:38:48,319
So you don't like it.

4623
02:38:48,319 --> 02:38:49,680
So just before the shoot.

4624
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:51,870
You were showing me a video.

4625
02:38:51,870 --> 02:38:53,330
And I told him.

4626
02:38:53,330 --> 02:38:54,330
I don't have YouTube.

4627
02:38:54,330 --> 02:38:55,330
I'm watching it on Safari.

4628
02:38:55,330 --> 02:38:56,330
Because I'm detoxing.

4629
02:38:56,330 --> 02:38:57,330
So the idea is simple.

4630
02:38:57,330 --> 02:38:59,279
I don't keep all these apps on my phone.

4631
02:38:59,279 --> 02:39:00,920
Because I'm so engrossed in the office.

4632
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:01,920
YouTube.

4633
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:02,920
Instagram.

4634
02:39:02,920 --> 02:39:03,920
Facebook.

4635
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:04,920
Twitter.

4636
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:05,920
None of the apps are on my phone.

4637
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:07,670
So that is one thing that I don't do.

4638
02:39:07,670 --> 02:39:10,280
Like don't keep it in my phone.

4639
02:39:10,280 --> 02:39:11,280
I install it.

4640
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:12,280
For fitness.

4641
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:13,280
So there are various basic things.

4642
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:14,770
On which we collectively work throughout the
office.

4643
02:39:14,770 --> 02:39:15,770
Like.

4644
02:39:15,770 --> 02:39:17,910
From this data I've got from internet only.

4645
02:39:17,910 --> 02:39:19,590
That if you walk 10,000 steps in a day.

4646
02:39:19,590 --> 02:39:24,479
So you can stay away from a lot of diseases.

4647
02:39:24,479 --> 02:39:25,479
So we have.

4648
02:39:25,479 --> 02:39:26,960
We are doing a step up challenge in our office.

4649
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:29,240
So we are 35 people.

4650
02:39:29,240 --> 02:39:32,440
So 35 people are challenging each other.

4651
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:35,050
And everyone has to complete 10,000 steps.

4652
02:39:35,050 --> 02:39:36,280
Every single day.

4653
02:39:36,280 --> 02:39:38,330
It's tracked on an app.

4654
02:39:38,330 --> 02:39:43,380
I mean a step up app.

4655
02:39:43,380 --> 02:39:44,860
It will be tracked on that.

4656
02:39:44,860 --> 02:39:48,010
And the winners will get exciting prizes.

4657
02:39:48,010 --> 02:39:50,800
So this is how we are promoting fitness.

4658
02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:51,800
In our office.

4659
02:39:51,800 --> 02:39:54,890
We should implement something like this at
our office.

4660
02:39:54,890 --> 02:39:55,890
This app.

4661
02:39:55,890 --> 02:39:59,790
Because I want.

4662
02:39:59,790 --> 02:40:07,930
It tracks through just the smartphone.

4663
02:40:07,930 --> 02:40:11,780
Or it can pair with an Apple watch.

4664
02:40:11,780 --> 02:40:13,200
Or a fitness band.

4665
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:14,200
Or whatever.

4666
02:40:14,200 --> 02:40:15,200
Yeah, yeah.

4667
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:18,820
It can be paired with a fitness band also.

4668
02:40:18,820 --> 02:40:27,319
Or it can be paired with your phone as well.

4669
02:40:27,319 --> 02:40:39,870
Because the steps on the phone will be a little
inaccurate.

4670
02:40:39,870 --> 02:40:45,620
Because you either have to keep the phone
in the gym.

4671
02:40:45,620 --> 02:40:52,460
Now there's a catch in that as well.

4672
02:40:52,460 --> 02:40:56,899
If you do it like this.

4673
02:40:56,899 --> 02:41:04,790
Then also the step count will be there.

4674
02:41:04,790 --> 02:41:10,860
But we will give that benefit of doubt.

4675
02:41:10,860 --> 02:41:11,860
Obviously.

4676
02:41:11,860 --> 02:41:12,860
It's up to you.

4677
02:41:12,860 --> 02:41:16,010
At least if someone is doing it like this
with dedication.

4678
02:41:16,010 --> 02:41:19,410
Then it will be a little more impressive.

4679
02:41:19,410 --> 02:41:20,410
But yeah.

4680
02:41:20,410 --> 02:41:21,430
It's a good thing.

4681
02:41:21,430 --> 02:41:22,430
And people.

4682
02:41:22,430 --> 02:41:23,430
I mean all the team members.

4683
02:41:23,430 --> 02:41:24,500
They are taking it very positively.

4684
02:41:24,500 --> 02:41:26,260
And this is one thing we are doing.

4685
02:41:26,260 --> 02:41:27,370
But slowly and gradually.

4686
02:41:27,370 --> 02:41:28,760
We will amplify it more.

4687
02:41:28,760 --> 02:41:30,430
We have just started with walking.

4688
02:41:30,430 --> 02:41:32,640
Walking is the best exercise.

4689
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:33,760
By the way.

4690
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:35,939
You had also told in a podcast.

4691
02:41:35,939 --> 02:41:37,689
I used to walk 30,000 steps.

4692
02:41:37,689 --> 02:41:38,689
Yeah, exactly.

4693
02:41:38,689 --> 02:41:39,689
4 months straight I did that.

4694
02:41:39,689 --> 02:41:40,689
And I lost 30 kilos in 4 months.

4695
02:41:40,689 --> 02:41:41,689
Wow!

4696
02:41:41,689 --> 02:41:42,689
From 105 to 75.

4697
02:41:42,689 --> 02:41:47,960
You told me this in your podcast.

4698
02:41:47,960 --> 02:41:54,090
If I open my health app and go to the gym
for that duration the rings go around 10 times.

4699
02:41:54,090 --> 02:41:55,090
2000 calories burn.

4700
02:41:55,090 --> 02:41:56,890
2500 calories burn just from walking.

4701
02:41:56,890 --> 02:41:59,069
3 hours, 3.5 hours, 4 hours walk.

4702
02:41:59,069 --> 02:42:02,500
Walking is the best exercise.

4703
02:42:02,500 --> 02:42:09,090
You are always extreme.

4704
02:42:09,090 --> 02:42:11,340
You are always extreme.

4705
02:42:11,340 --> 02:42:14,570
This is in nature.

4706
02:42:14,570 --> 02:42:20,950
For me, it's either best or nothing.

4707
02:42:20,950 --> 02:42:35,380
As long as I am not doing it or if nothing
is involved then it's fine.

4708
02:42:35,380 --> 02:43:02,660
But the day I come in, I want to make sure
that I take the lead.

4709
02:43:02,660 --> 02:43:10,930
What a word of thanks.

4710
02:43:10,930 --> 02:43:21,410
I hope everyone enjoyed the conversation.

4711
02:43:21,410 --> 02:43:30,870
I am presuming.

4712
02:43:30,870 --> 02:43:46,340
There 

4713
02:43:46,340 --> 02:43:48,819
will be takeaways for everyone.

4714
02:43:48,819 --> 02:44:08,160
And hopefully we can 
do 

4715
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:36,740
this next year as well.

4716
02:44:36,740 --> 02:44:44,351
That's the idea.

4717
02:44:44,351 --> 02:44:50,500
This is just the beginning.

4718
02:44:50,500 --> 02:44:58,220
How much duration did you do?

4719
02:44:58,220 --> 02:45:00,430
3.5 hours.

4720
02:45:00,430 --> 02:45:26,250
3.5 to 4 hours.

4721
02:45:26,250 --> 02:45:55,310
I am getting a lot of blessings from my heart
for some editor.

4722
02:45:55,310 --> 02:46:14,410
2,000 to 4,000 GB data.

4723
02:46:14,410 --> 02:46:32,560
The editor is watching the video.

4724
02:46:32,560 --> 02:46:45,290
Minimum 3,000 to 4,000 GB data.

4725
02:46:45,290 --> 02:47:01,529
If there 

4726
02:47:01,529 --> 02:47:32,620
are 8 cameras and 3 roles.

4727
02:47:32,620 --> 02:47:57,990
And RAW.
3 to 4 TB data.

4728
02:47:57,990 --> 02:48:10,439
That's 

4729
02:48:10,439 --> 02:48:22,470
what I am saying.

4730
02:48:22,470 --> 02:48:23,470
All done.

4731
02:48:23,470 --> 02:49:22,140
Thank you 

4732
02:49:22,140 --> 02:50:47,110
so much.

4733
02:50:47,110 --> 02:53:29,891
It was fantastic.

4734
02:53:29,891 --> 03:01:25,930
Thank you, crew.
