1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,535
- That helicopter is
carrying a military squad,

2
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,904
and it's gonna land right over there.

3
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:06,506
(explosion booms)
If that squad successfully

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,907
hunts me down before the end of the day,

5
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:08,808
they get this hundred grand.

6
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:09,642
Run, run, run.

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,012
Get in, get in.
- Go, go, go.

8
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:12,979
- Oh, they're running after us.

9
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:13,880
They are right on our tail,

10
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,714
we gotta get outta here.

11
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,616
I purposely put their car further away

12
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:17,550
so I can get a head start.

13
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,885
- [Sean] Get in the vehicle, let's go!

14
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:19,853
Come on.

15
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,988
(intense instrumental music)

16
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,323
- Right now he's not too far away.

17
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,325
He's right on the other side
of these trees it looks like.

18
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,726
- All right, we gotta be quick.

19
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,595
Okay, we're crossing the bridge.

20
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,729
Hey Chandler?

21
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:30,897
- Yeah?
- You know what to do.

22
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,399
- I got you.
(engine rumbling)

23
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,266
I've been waiting for this.

24
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,401
- So I've done this in the past

25
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,603
where I ran away from a
bounty hunter, and the FBI,

26
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,272
but I've never ran away
from three different people.

27
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,841
(intense instrumental music)

28
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,811
(explosion booming)

29
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,313
- I think Jimmy can get away now.

30
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,349
- We're like a mile down
the road and I heard that.

31
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,185
- Ooh.
- Oh.

32
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,521
- Yeah, you might have to go another way.

33
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,890
- The quickest way out of
that field is this bridge

34
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,924
that we just blew up.
(explosion booming)

35
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,793
So now they have to take the long way out,

36
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,028
and that should give me like a
five to 10 minute head start.

37
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:05,031
I rented an entire museum,
have dozens of cars,

38
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:08,001
giant military equipment,
and so much other cool stuff.

39
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,335
This is just the beginning.

40
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,338
- He's heading up, back up like northwest.

41
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,540
- This is where things get fun.

42
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,542
As you see the Squid Game mask over there,

43
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,643
we're in the right place.
- What?

44
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,577
Who is this guy?

45
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,712
- Now we are in a warehouse full of jeeps.

46
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,147
Let's just say when they pull up,

47
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,649
they're gonna be very confused.

48
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:23,483
Do you know what to do when they get here?

49
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,317
- No.
- No.

50
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,685
- [Jimmy] Just drive
in a random direction.

51
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:26,986
- Right now?
- No, when they get here.

52
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,521
- Oh.
- And now we patiently wait

53
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,056
and monitor the security cam.

54
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:32,092
- Looks like he's stopped at a building.

55
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,893
- [Cameraman 2] What's the
strategy? Wait, is that a knife?

56
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,296
- Yeah.
- Is this the spot boys?

57
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,466
- Yeah, this is the spot.
(intense instrumental music)

58
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,135
- We've spotted the military
squad on the security cameras.

59
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,770
All the doors on this building are locked.

60
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,472
Let's see if they break
into the warehouse.

61
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,506
- I'm gonna stay out front,

62
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,308
just in case somebody decides
to run out the front door.

63
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,976
- We're gonna check out the backside,

64
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,444
see if there's a vehicle back here.

65
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,246
- So one of them is
waiting at the front door,

66
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,714
and two of them are in the back.

67
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,015
We're just gonna patiently wait.

68
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,884
- The tracker is still in the building.

69
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,052
- [Zach] We got some glass doors

70
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,220
we can break up front here.

71
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,054
- All right, sounds good.

72
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,856
I'm gonna grab this to
go break some windows.

73
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,824
- There are fresh tire
tracks leading in as well.

74
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:05,859
- Jim's going to get the vehicle,

75
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,060
I'm gonna go ahead and break in.

76
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,962
- [Sean] All right, go

77
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,830
(glass shattering)

78
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,232
- [Voice On Radio] Military
has breached the building.

79
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,466
It's time to go.

80
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,270
- I should probably recline,
so its harder to see me.

81
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,505
I'm gonna hide under this blanket,

82
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,039
so they can't see me in this car.

83
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,441
Lock your doors.
- Go, go, go, now!

84
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,010
- Zach, let's roll back to the Hummer.

85
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,645
(intense instrumental music)

86
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,115
(engine noise drown out speaker)

87
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,550
- [Jim] Which one? Which one?

88
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,518
- [Cameraman] That should
be them, right there.

89
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,886
- [Jimmy] Do they notice me?

90
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,820
- [Cameraman] We drove
right past each other.

91
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,922
(intense instrumental music)

92
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,757
- We made it out with all the other teams.

93
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,591
Oh my gosh!

94
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,493
Dude, they didn't even know how to react.

95
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,461
- He's on the move again.

96
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,363
He's straight ahead due south.

97
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,698
- This is the tracker that
is telling the military squad

98
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:46,966
where I am at all times.

99
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,602
And if I put the tracker
inside of this special bag,

100
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:50,470
it jams it.

101
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,072
And now they don't know where I am.

102
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,941
- It looks like the
vehicle may have stopped.

103
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:55,775
- I don't see Jimmy.

104
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:56,709
I think he's messing with us.

105
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,378
- All right, so hold on. It just updated.

106
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,646
He's straight north again.

107
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,513
(Sean cheering)

108
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,650
(upbeat instrumental music)

109
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,884
- And now we're in the middle of nowhere.

110
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,286
There's literally nothing out here,

111
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,022
except this old barn
that I had constructed.

112
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,290
- Whoa.
- Mind if I set

113
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,257
my hundred grand right here?

114
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,091
Bad news.

115
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,893
There's only two seats inside of here.

116
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,628
(Jimmy groans)

117
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,096
- I think I see them.
(duck quacks)

118
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,264
- Coming up on the tracker.

119
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,365
- Holy cow, here they come!

120
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,500
- Check the car, and take the top.

121
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,102
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
- Hey, hey, hey, look, look.

122
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,837
There he is. There he is.
- Brace yourself.

123
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,239
(wood splintering)

124
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,674
(intense instrumental music)

125
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,276
- [Jim] Get in, get in.

126
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,378
- [Sean] Let's go.

127
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,047
- Oh my god!

128
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:34,881
- Run away! Don't stop!

129
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,349
Go!
- Hey guys! Guys!

130
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,717
Hey, I'd like to join your guys team,

131
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,585
what do you think?

132
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,420
- Get in.
- You think?

133
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,789
(Karl laughs)

134
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,723
- [Cameraman 2] That's not funny.

135
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,857
- Saved Jimmy some time.

136
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:45,959
Hopefully that's enough.

137
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,427
- Go, go, go, go, go.

138
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,461
- All right boys, here we go.

139
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,295
Let's go.

140
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,230
- It's this as quick as she goes?

141
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,497
- Full speed.

142
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,832
- There he is. There he is.

143
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,267
We're coming for you Jimmy.

144
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,102
- Oh my God! They're catching up!

145
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,003
Go!

146
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,840
(intense instrumental music)

147
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,844
- [Cameraman] This is scary man!

148
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,246
- We're coming up on the rocks.

149
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,180
(squad laughs)

150
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,014
- We got you!

151
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,015
- According to our calculations,

152
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,251
their cars shouldn't be
able to go over these rocks.

153
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,518
All right.
- Here we go!

154
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,353
- Go, go, go, go.

155
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,687
Just go.

156
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:18,758
(truck engine rumbling)

157
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,028
(cameraman laughs)

158
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,696
- [Cameraman] Later nerds!

159
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,764
- Let's go, yeah we can go.

160
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,832
Just go.

161
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,268
(intense instrumental music)

162
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,304
- Oh no!
(cameraman yelling)

163
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,138
- Clear.

164
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,008
Boys let's go.
- Wait!

165
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,110
They weren't supposed to go over the rock!

166
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,811
- I don't think he thought
we were gonna do that.

167
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,014
- Oh no! I'm screwed!

168
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,049
The plan was to get in
those porta potties,

169
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,517
but then the rocks didn't work.

170
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,418
Just go!

171
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,788
(intense instrumental music)
- [Zach] And what's the plan?

172
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,856
Let's think of a plan.
- The plan is

173
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:50,957
we're gonna catch him.

174
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,659
(squad laughing)
- [Zach] That's it. That's it.

175
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,994
(intense instrumental music)

176
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,129
- Send the helicopter.

177
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,996
Go, go, go.

178
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,332
(intense instrumental music)

179
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,166
- [Cameraman 2] You heard Jimmy?

180
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,000
- Hurry up, he's in there.

181
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,068
He's in the truck.
- Get me out of this

182
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,269
and I'll give you ten grand.

183
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,771
- We're coming for you.

184
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,439
- That's a badass truck.
- Yeah it is! (Sean laughs)

185
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,440
They can't go very fast though.

186
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,643
(engine roaring)

187
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,545
- All right, we've got a proposition.

188
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,981
You double the money to 200K,

189
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,916
we'll give you 10 minutes from right now.

190
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,418
- What about 150?

191
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,619
- 150, deal?

192
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,887
Pull over Jim.
- Can we get

193
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,156
a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Blizzard?

194
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,123
- Do know who Mr. Beast is?

195
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,059
- Yeah, I do.
- We're actually chasing him

196
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,894
right now, so we're gonna
need these pretty quick.

197
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,630
We just gave Jimmy a 10 minute head start.

198
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,765
We already decided we're
gonna donate the money anyway.

199
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,734
We know we can help out
a lot of people with it.

200
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,636
- And while the military got ice cream,

201
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,639
we buried Nolan alive so that
they would think he was me.

202
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,773
(slow instrumental music)

203
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:41,908
Nolan?
- Yeah.

204
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,110
- Are you ready? I'm about
to drop my tracker down.

205
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,712
I dropped it. Did you get it?

206
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,246
- No.
- Good cause I didn't drop it,

207
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,247
but I just did.

208
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,016
(Nolan groans)
- [Nolan] Ow, it hit my face

209
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,551
- Act like your me, I'm gonna go hide.

210
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,952
Me and Chris are hiding in the woods,

211
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:53,786
let's see what happens.

212
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:54,921
Do you think they'll see us here?

213
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,190
I swear to god if we lose a 150
grand cause of your hiccups,

214
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,024
I'm gonna kill you.
(Chris hiccups)

215
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:58,991
- I can't help it, I can't get rid of-

216
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,626
- Can you just go walk down
and see if you find them?

217
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:01,461
- Yeah, sure.

218
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,995
It's very dark and spooky out here.

219
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,697
Couple of, oh...

220
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,666
You guys aren't very good
at being military people.

221
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,368
Oh god! Don't tackle me.

222
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,369
(Chris screams)

223
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,336
- I just heard Chris screaming.

224
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,170
I'm gonna call him.

225
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,106
- [Chris] Jimmy they got me.
- Did you see that video

226
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,140
where I buried myself alive?

227
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,442
- We've done a lot of
reconnaissance on you my friend.

228
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,276
- I can tell.

229
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,245
This whole video you've been
screwing up all my plans.

230
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,079
It's annoying.

231
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,347
I'm currently buried alive.

232
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,181
Good luck.
(phone beeps)

233
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,015
I hung up on them.

234
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,484
That was a complete lie,
let's see if they fall for it.

235
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,619
- So right now he's still
supposed to be buried in here,

236
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:27,553
so we'll see.

237
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,388
(phone rings)
- [Karl] Hello?

238
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,822
- Karl, they're almost here.

239
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,391
You go investigate, report back.

240
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,458
- Okay.
- Hurry.

241
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,960
(phone beeps)
These guys are good.

242
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,495
I'm terrified.

243
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,562
- Hello?

244
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,397
- [Jimmy] Who was it?

245
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,865
- Are these my Marine friends

246
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,433
that are right in front of my car?

247
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,267
- Is it a Hummer?

248
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,201
Wait Karl who is it?
- That are right

249
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,169
in front of my car.

250
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,470
(engine rumbling)
- Karl, is it them?

251
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,139
- Hey, what's up?
- Karl, is it them?

252
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,540
Karl, is it them?

253
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,208
Karl! Karl!
- Wait before you go,

254
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,943
wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh,
you're driving away right now,

255
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,712
and he is driving through
the path right now.

256
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:53,813
- They blocked off our exit route.

257
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,081
I have no idea what they are,

258
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,182
I'm just laying in the woods.

259
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,116
- Jimmy?
- Yeah?

260
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,552
- Earlier today, before we
jumped on the helicopter,

261
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,386
who'd you talk to?

262
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,021
- I don't remember, that
was a long time ago.

263
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,656
- Was it FaceTime or phone call?

264
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,757
- FaceTime.

265
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,691
(Sean grunting)
- Not him.

266
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,093
- You couldn't have been
like, "I don't remember,

267
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,394
I'm Jimmy, I'm famous."

268
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,862
- I have the tracker.

269
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,864
You can't find Jimmy without me.

270
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:12,698
- Fair enough.

271
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,400
- You literally have to dig me up.

272
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,336
- You guys have to dig
up Nolan of all people.

273
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,171
- Hello?

274
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,539
- Let me know if he comes down this path.

275
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,840
- He's passing my car right now,

276
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,575
you gotta go somewhere.

277
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,576
- [Jimmy] Yo, yo, yo.

278
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,878
He literally just walked
right past me, oh my gosh!

279
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,880
- [Karl] Just move it that way.

280
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,016
- I can't believe he
literally walked past me.

281
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,418
I've been laying down
on the side of the path.

282
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,854
(intense instrumental music)

283
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,722
- If you come to me right now, we're fine.

284
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,891
I moved their Humvee, so
it's not blocking us anymore.

285
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:39,959
- So the coast is clear Karl?

286
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,027
- Yes.
- Okay, I'm coming.

287
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,062
I'm trusting you.
- Okay.

288
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,730
I don't actually know if it is.

289
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,334
(intense instrumental music)

290
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,336
Close the door, oh my God!
- Just get us outta here.

291
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,170
Go, go, go.

292
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,738
Oh my God, I can't believe we got away!

293
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,941
We're currently driving
to the final location.

294
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,343
I literally rented an entire museum.

295
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:01,481
Two hours until midnight,
$150,000 on the line,

296
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,517
let's do this.
(Karl cheers)

297
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,685
- Hey Nolan, just letting you know

298
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,687
they're contemplating breaking the glass.

299
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,521
- [Nolan] Oh don't...

300
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,455
No seriously, I'll die.

301
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,057
- If you tell me the information

302
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,692
that we need to know to keep moving,

303
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,693
I'll get the Bobcat,

304
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,328
and we'll dig you out
a hundred times faster

305
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,163
than Jim and I can dig
you out with shovels.

306
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,397
Deal?
- Deal.

307
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:21,434
The North Carolina Museum
of Natural Sciences.

308
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,902
- I'm just letting you know,

309
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,037
they're not getting the
backhoe, they're leaving.

310
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:25,872
- No.
- All right,

311
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:26,939
we'll see you later Nolan, bye

312
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:27,874
- Are they lying?

313
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,008
Chris!

314
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,110
- And now we are finally at the museum.

315
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,278
- Let's spend a night here.

316
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,113
- There's literally
multiple different floors

317
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:34,947
to this museum,

318
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,282
and I could hide anywhere I want.

319
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,017
Now I'm gonna sit in
this corner right here,

320
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,520
and I'm gonna cover up
my back with this jacket.

321
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,922
(Karl grunting)

322
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,924
Now I'm hidden below this makeshift rock.

323
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,726
Cut the lights.

324
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,560
- Oh.

325
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,494
I'm gonna go meet with them,

326
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,563
and try to get them to
go other directions.

327
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,664
- [Jimmy] Okay, have fun.

328
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,498
(Humvee door slams)
- All right.

329
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,867
- Exactly an hour left to find Mr. Beast.

330
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,435
- The military guys are calling me.

331
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,937
Hello?
- Hello?

332
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,373
- I promise you I will
not leave this museum.

333
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,507
I am in here somewhere.

334
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,441
Goodbye.
(phone beeps)

335
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,510
Why is it so much fun
to hang up on people?

336
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,511
- Hi guys.
- Hey.

337
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,679
- What are you guys looking for?

338
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,047
- [Jim] Ignore him, he's the enemy.

339
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,350
- I'd check the theater.
- I'd check the theater.

340
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,618
- No.
- Yeah, he's not allowed

341
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,452
in there.

342
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,420
(all laughing)

343
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,755
Yes, he's probably this way.

344
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,390
- Ah, nope. That means no.

345
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,225
Jimmy come out.

346
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,128
Do you know where Jimmy is?
- Yes I do,

347
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,329
and of course I'll tell you.

348
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,765
- Okay, where is he?
(Sean groans)

349
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,599
Jimmy.

350
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,934
All right, nothing.

351
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,201
- Hello?
- Did you by chance

352
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,970
go across any bridges?

353
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,104
- Lots of bridges,

354
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,707
especially the bridge I
blew up at start the video.

355
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,342
(Jimmy cheers)
- Oh!

356
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,410
(Karl laughs)

357
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,878
We got 45 minutes.

358
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:39,712
- Jimmy.

359
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,147
We know you're here.

360
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,216
(suspenseful music)

361
00:09:58,564 --> 00:09:59,799
- Oh no.

362
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,866
What gave it away?

363
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,201
- Your shoes.
- Wait, really?

364
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,235
He's taking a picture
(camera snapping)

365
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,070
for his son.

366
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,572
All right, get this
stupid rock off my head.

367
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,107
You guys just won a 150 grand.

368
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:08,941
(squad cheering)
What are you

369
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:09,775
gonna spend it on?

370
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,211
- We're gonna donate it to
the HunterSeven Foundation.

371
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,180
The HunterSeven Foundation does research

372
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,450
on toxic exposures for veterans
from the last couple wars.

373
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,518
- By the way, your friend
Nolan, he's still in the ground.

374
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:23,856
♪ Mr. Beast oh ♪
(explosion booming)

375
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,827
- Dig me out. Dig me out!
