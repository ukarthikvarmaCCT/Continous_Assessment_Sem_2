00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,740
how did he think of all these variables

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,960
or you got to be a gymnast and a sniper

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,299

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,360

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,440

53
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,020
timing I could

54
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,420
I could level 30 cup pyramid trick shots

55
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,000

a lot of tries we've done a lot of

71
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,080
things with boats and boats are

72
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,360
notorious for having the skedaddle very

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,060

and he sinks it up

142
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,840
the thing about a lot of these the

143
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,460
coolest part about them is how they came

144
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,560
up with the trick themselves who would

145
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,759
have thought of that someone with a

146
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,500
helicopter someone with a helicopter

147
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,800

oh and he makes it uh I gotta say

152
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,860
helicopter's cooler I agree the

153
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,320
difficulty of the last one was harder I

154
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,940
feel like I could do that the helicopter

155
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,400
one I could not level 55. I'm going to
