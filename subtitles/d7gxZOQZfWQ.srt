00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,016
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,016 --> 00:00:02,680
28th June 1914.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,414
A 19-year-old student at a school,

4
00:00:05,604 --> 00:00:10,240
assassinates the Austro-Hungarian Prince.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,223
And this one incident,

6
00:00:12,223 --> 00:00:13,335
triggered the war.

7
00:00:13,684 --> 00:00:15,770
A war that lasted four years.

8
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,661
In which more than 20 million people lost their lives.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,485
A war, in which, several ancient empires came to an end.

10
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:26,898
A war that was fought across multiple countries and continents.

11
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:30,822
Today, we know of this war as the
World War I.

12
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:33,314
Doesn't it sound very sensational?

13
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:35,353
Because of this one single event,

14
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:36,970
World War I broke across the world.

15
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,387
If we could go back to the past in a time machine,

16
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:41,222
and if we could prevent this assassination,

17
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,394
would there be no World Wars in the world?

18
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:45,191
The reality isn't this simple, friends.

19
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:46,952
When there's a large scale war like this,

20
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:50,626
there is a long and complex chain of reasons driving it.

21
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:53,832
And then there's one such incident that causes a spark.

22
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:56,976
Imagine if there's a mountain of dynamites here.

23
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,355
And I use a small matchstick to blow up the entire mountain,

24
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:05,584
the following blast would not be because of my matchstick,

25
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:08,152
there was a mountain of dynamite there

26
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,259
that's why it happened.

27
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:10,736
Come, in today's video,

28
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:12,344
let's understand World War I.

29
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:14,209
"January 1916,

30
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:17,723
140,000 men were assembling for the attack."

31
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:30,316
In the year 1914,

32
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:32,071
Europe looked like this on a map.

33
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:35,044
There was an Austro Hungarian empire in the middle,

34
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:37,998
the empire was much bigger than the present size of the countries Austria and Hungary. 

35
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:42,081
Germany's empire was also much bigger than present-day Germany.

36
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:43,545
Poland wasn't a country.

37
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:45,591
There was the Russian Empire in Russia.

38
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:48,391
There was the Ottoman Empire in present-day Turkey.  

39
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:51,073
Apart from these, there was the United Kingdom and France.

40
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:53,061
It's interesting to know friends,

41
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:55,891
most of the European countries were monarchies at the time.

42
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:58,326
There were rulers in those places.

43
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,490
In fact, there were only 3 European countries

44
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,441
that were Democracies rather than monarchies.

45
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:05,463
France, Switzerland and San Marino.

46
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:06,873
There are some countries in Eastern Europe

47
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:09,300
such as Serbia, Bosnia, Romania, and Bulgaria,

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,085
collectively called the Balkan Countries.

49
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,666
Don't forget them, they're very important for our story.

50
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:17,192
We will begin our story from the year 1878.

51
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,534
There was a war between the Russian empire and the Ottoman empire.

52
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:23,367
Ottoman empire was on one side

53
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:24,911
and the Russian empire on the other

54
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:29,536
helping the Balkan countries separate from the Ottoman empire.

55
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:30,907
At the conclusion of the war,

56
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:33,710
the Treaty of Berlin was signed in 1878.

57
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,221
According to this treaty,

58
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,709
the Austro Hungarian empire was given the right

59
00:02:37,963 --> 00:02:43,149
to administer the region of Bosnia-Herzegovina 

60
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:44,285
temporarily.

61
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:47,137
But the area would officially be a part of the Ottoman empire.

62
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:49,296
But in October 1908,

63
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:53,754
the Austro Hungarian empire annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina.

64
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:54,977
Invaded there.

65
00:02:54,977 --> 00:02:58,080
This political caricature from then is very interesting.

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,552
The Ottoman Sultan, with his folded hands, is feeling helpless.

67
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:05,468
Because of the internal problems in the Ottoman empire.

68
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:07,381
There were internal revolutions.

69
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,943
During this time, Bulgaria successfully separated from the Ottoman empire

70
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:13,657
represented as the independent state in the middle.

71
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:17,327
On the left, you can see the Austrian emperor, Franz Josef,

72
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:20,242
is trying to steal Bosnia-Herzegovina.

73
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,876
He is ripping it out of the map to steal it.

74
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:24,335
The region of Bosnia-Herzegovina

75
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:27,176
was under the Ottoman empire for 400 years,

76
00:03:27,493 --> 00:03:29,146
but instead of getting independence,

77
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:31,944
another empire came in and captured them.

78
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:35,981
Obviously, the people of Bosnia were enraged at this.

79
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,341
They wanted freedom.

80
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,639
People in the neighbouring country Serbia were also infuriated at seeing this happen. 

81
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:46,134
The Serbians didn't only have a geographical connection with the Bosnians

82
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:47,998
they even had an ethnic connection.

83
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:50,578
Actually, all the Eastern European countries

84
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:52,892
have the ethnicity of Slavs.

85
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:56,193
Many people living in these countries feel this connection.

86
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,197
In fact, if you look at the bottom of the map,

87
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:01,191
the countries in dark blue,

88
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:04,789
the people in these countries call themselves South Slavs.

89
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,824
Many people in these countries

90
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:09,887
even demanded a South Slavic Nation.

91
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:11,851
Serbia complained that

92
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,905
the Austro Hungary empire

93
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:16,344
wasn't merely invading Bosnia,

94
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:18,684
rather, they were invading the South Slavs.

95
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:22,791
Before capturing the country, the foreign minister of Austria-Hungary,

96
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,478
had already spoken with the Russian foreign minister,

97
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:27,615
asking Russia to refrain from objecting to it

98
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:30,540
as they were giving them prior intimation of their capture.

99
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,323
And Russia agreed to them.

100
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:34,736
Because Russia wanted something in return.

101
00:04:34,736 --> 00:04:36,721
Look at this map, this is the Black Sea,

102
00:04:36,721 --> 00:04:38,297
and the Sea of Marmar is in the South.

103
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:40,950
the Strait of Bosphorus joins the two.

104
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,899
And dividing Istanbul into 2.

105
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,160
This part belonged to the Ottoman empire.

106
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,251
And Russia wanted to have this.

107
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:49,638
So Russia told the Austro-Hungarian empire

108
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:52,504
that Russia would annex the region.

109
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,140
And so they shouldn't oppose them.

110
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,827
And Russia wouldn't say anything either when they capture Bosnia.

111
00:04:56,827 --> 00:04:57,943
A good deal.

112
00:04:58,102 --> 00:04:59,275
But there was a problem.

113
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:01,938
The problem was that many Slavic people lived in Russia.

114
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,109
And many Russians started protesting the invasion of Bosnia.

115
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:10,153
How could they agree to the Austro-Hungarian empire

116
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:12,647
getting control of Slavic people?

117
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,917
The Russian empire was already weak.

118
00:05:15,203 --> 00:05:17,117
It had to abide by the wishes of the people.

119
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,113
So despite the secret agreement,

120
00:05:19,113 --> 00:05:21,285
the Russian foreign minister

121
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:23,125
started supporting Serbia.

122
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,621
It was 1909,

123
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:28,089
the Austro-Hungarian empire turned towards Germany and asks them

124
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,125
if they capture Serbia,

125
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,149
and Russia comes to interfere, 

126
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:34,781
would Germany help the Austro-Hungarian empire?

127
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:38,496
Germany agrees to help them as they were old friends.

128
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:39,971
They'd definitely help.

129
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:42,442
On the other hand, Russia asks France,

130
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,071
Austro-Hungarian empire had first invaded Bosnia,

131
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:48,666
and when Serbia objected to it,

132
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,021
the Austro-Hungarian empire and Germany,

133
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:53,976
had joined forces to attack Serbia.

134
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:57,583
Russia proposed that France should join its forces with Russia to fight against them.

135
00:05:58,154 --> 00:05:59,733
But France replies that

136
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,297
it has nothing to do with Bosnia.

137
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:05,078
regardless of what happened, they didn't want to interfere in the matter.

138
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:07,739
France's refusal silenced Russia.

139
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,218
And it had to accept the annexation of Bosnia.

140
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:12,865
With this,

141
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:14,671
the threat of a war

142
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:16,036
the threat of World War ensuing

143
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:17,077
passes.

144
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:20,975
But then comes the assassination of Ferdinand.

145
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:22,365
The thing was that,

146
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:24,527
the Bosnians that were annexed,

147
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:26,150
the Bosnians didn't accept that meekly.

148
00:06:26,563 --> 00:06:28,583
The Bosnians wanted freedom.

149
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:31,157
A new revolutionary movement had begun.

150
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,192
It is named the Young Bosnia.

151
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,167
It was a revolutionary group of students.

152
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:37,744
And the Serbians were helping them.

153
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,556
They aimed to build an independent country.

154
00:06:40,556 --> 00:06:44,835
In fact, not only did they aim to free Bosnia-Herzegovina, 

155
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:47,382
but also to unite with Serbia.

156
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,675
They wanted to build a United South Slavic nation.

157
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:53,248
Yugoslavia.

158
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:55,422
What a beautiful name, Yugoslavia.

159
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:57,251
Yugo means South.

160
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,612
An apt term for a South Slavic country.

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,450
Spoiler alert, it did become a reality later on.

162
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,361
Although, by now, the country has broken apart too.

163
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:08,752
But anyway, on 28th June 1914,

164
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:11,506
the prince of Austro-Hungary, Ferdinand,

165
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:17,034
with his wife, Sophie, went to visit the annexed territory in Bosnia.

166
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:19,815
They wanted to travel through the newly acquired territory, 

167
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,269
but soon that cause much suffering to them.

168
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,087
Six Bosnian revolutionaries planned to assassinate them.

169
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:27,477
Around 10 in the morning,

170
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:30,174
a revolutionary named Cabrinovic,

171
00:07:30,555 --> 00:07:33,140
threw a bomb near Ferdinand's car.

172
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,831
But the bomb bounced on the car and blew up in a side street. 

173
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,527
Injuring 20 people.

174
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:40,731
Ferdinand escaped this.

175
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:44,239
The meeting he was headed to was then cancelled because of the shock

176
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,764
and tells the Bosnian mayor that

177
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:54,283
They decided to cancel the program and go to the hospital.

178
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:56,682
To meet the injured people.

179
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:58,376
On the way to the hospital,

180
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:01,986
their car takes a wrong turn mistakenly.

181
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:05,100
When they tried to get back to the correct route,

182
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,112
they realised that actually,

183
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:11,017
they were a mere 5 feet away from a revolutionary.

184
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:13,123
A 19-year-old school student,

185
00:08:13,123 --> 00:08:14,779
Gavrilo Princip,

186
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:16,726
I talked about him at the beginning of the video.

187
00:08:16,726 --> 00:08:21,356
This was the person to shoot at Ferdinand and his wife Sophie.

188
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:24,968
And so assassinated the prince of the Austro-Hungarian empire.

189
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:27,809
Gavrilo Princip was arrested immediately

190
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:30,744
but he was 2 months short of 20 years

191
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,817
and so, according to the law, he couldn't be given the death sentence.

192
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:38,413
Gavrilo was sentenced to 20 years in jail for this assassination.

193
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:40,717
During the trial, he said that

194
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:42,799
he was a Yugoslav Nationalist.

195
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:46,270
That he aimed to unite the yugo slavs.

196
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:50,342
But it didn't matter to him which state would Yugoslav be a part of.

197
00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:52,294
But during the trials, he wanted that

198
00:08:52,294 --> 00:08:54,039
Bosnia should be free from Austria.

199
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:58,476
The emperor of the Austro-Hungarian empire is enraged at the assassination.

200
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:00,099
In his anger,

201
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:02,533
the declares war on Serbia.

202
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:06,508
Russia sees this as an attempt to annex Serbia.

203
00:09:06,508 --> 00:09:08,636
And so Russia went to save Serbia.

204
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:13,664
Germany saw that Russia was taking arms against the Austro-Hungarian empire.

205
00:09:13,664 --> 00:09:16,593
And so Germany went to save the Austro-Hungarian empire.

206
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:18,519
This time, France doesn't stay behind.

207
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:21,392
France reached there in support of Russia and Serbia.

208
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:23,918
This created an interesting chain

209
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:26,312
called the Chain of Friendship.

210
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:28,518
This is an interesting caricature

211
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:31,028
drawn to describe the situation.

212
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,808
Italy was in alliance with Austria-Hungary and Germany.

213
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:39,399
But Italy reneges on the agreement to support the two.

214
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,470
Because the agreement stated that in case of an attack on their country

215
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,163
the others would help them.

216
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:49,337
But it was Austria-Hungary and Germany that were invading Serbia.

217
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:50,777
They started the attacks.

218
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:52,260
So Italy claimed that they weren't bound to help.

219
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,358
But because the Ottoman empire had enmity with Russia,

220
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:59,606
the Ottoman empire reached in support of the Austro-Hungarian empire.

221
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:02,181
The United Kingdom gets involved in this too.

222
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:06,472
Because Russia, France, and Britain had an alliance treaty called the Triple Entente. 

223
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,619
This was how

224
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:10,469
the Great war ensued.

225
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:14,259
In which all these countries were at war with each other.

226
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:16,246
Later, countries like the USA and Japan

227
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:19,216
join this war in support of Britain and France.

228
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:22,515
And obviously, the countries that were under British rule,

229
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:23,537
like India,

230
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:25,200
gets involved in this war.

231
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,883
Because the British needed soldiers.

232
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:30,240
And the easiest option was to

233
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,187
use the people of the countries Britain had colonised as soldiers.

234
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:43,092
Many Indians went to participate in World War I on behalf of Britain.

235
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:46,024
Friends, this was how World War I began.

236
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:48,446
But a pertinent question arises here,

237
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:53,049
why were all these countries so eager to go on a war against each other?

238
00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:55,223
If something like this happens today,

239
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:57,809
so many countries wouldn't get into the war.

240
00:10:57,809 --> 00:10:59,461
What was so different then?

241
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:01,923
That these countries readily went to war.

242
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:03,760
Friends, it's said that there were four main reasons for it.

243
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:10,616
Friends, here Nationalism means

244
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:12,335
a nationalism without liberation.

245
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:14,151
A nationalism without independence. 

246
00:11:14,468 --> 00:11:17,016
A nationalism that was based on race.

247
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:20,255
On the belief that their country is the best in the world. 

248
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:24,059
And to have an aggressive attitude against the other countries.

249
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,322
Looking at other countries as inferiors.

250
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:30,442
Bismark had united Germany in 1871,

251
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:32,247
on the basis of nationalism.

252
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,931
But Germany was still a constitutional monarchy.

253
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:37,422
Under the Prussian monarchy.

254
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:42,486
The kings and emperors took advantage of this nationalism among people.

255
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:46,252
They convinced people to go on a war for their country.

256
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:50,010
And they declared war for Imperialism.

257
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,747
To capture and occupy the other countries. 

258
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,734
You might think that it is so difficult to manage one's own country,

259
00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:01,252
why would these people want to expand the borders of their countries?

260
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:03,584
Why did they want to invade other countries?

261
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:05,630
Causing them a greater administrative headache.

262
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:07,860
Friends, the simple answer to this is

263
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,143
Looting.

264
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:11,529
The kings and emperors annexed other countries

265
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:12,860
for their pride,

266
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,942
to gain power

267
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,916
by comparing the sizes of their empires

268
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:21,233
and to exploit the resources in those areas.

269
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:23,655
If gold was found somewhere, they'd loot it.

270
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:25,209
To keep it in their treasury.

271
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:26,821
By the 1900s,

272
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:28,607
this process of looting

273
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:31,378
was carried on by Capitalist countries too.

274
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:33,007
Like the East India Company.

275
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:36,396
It was the East India Company that had first captured areas in India

276
00:12:36,396 --> 00:12:38,783
and started draining India's wealth.

277
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:43,951
That's why many people call Imperialism the highest stage of capitalism.

278
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Capitalists capture other countries

279
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,906
exploit the raw material and cheap labour there

280
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:50,675
to earn more profit.

281
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:52,688
A famous capitalist of the time,

282
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,170
Henry Ford, the founder of the Ford company,

283
00:12:55,678 --> 00:13:00,039
gave a famous statement on war and capitalism.

284
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:11,750
There are numerous interesting things to know about World War I,

285
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,446
but if I start telling you all of them,

286
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:15,245
this video would be hours long.

287
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:17,046
If you want to know the details of the War,

288
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,334
I'd definitely ask you to

289
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:21,260
to listen to the World War I summary on KUKU FM.

290
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,654
This is a book summary over 2-hours long.

291
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:24,957
It is very interesting.

292
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:26,816
For those of you who do not know about KUKU FM,

293
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:28,790
it is a brilliant audio learning platform.

294
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,077
On it, you would get many such informative audiobooks and biographies.

295
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,573
The cost to access the entire platform

296
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:36,582
is normally ₹399 for the year.

297
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:38,973
But because KUKU FM has sponsored this video,

298
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:40,816
there's a special discount for you.

299
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:44,506
It would cost you only ₹199 per year

300

It means that you can access their entire library for a year at the cost of one movie ticket.

302
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:52,730
The link to it is in the description below.

303
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,053
Go check it out.

304
00:13:54,053 --> 00:13:55,203
Now, let's return to the topic.

305
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:57,002
Friends, this imperialism

306
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,202
wasn't possible without militarism.

307
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:03,343
The countries had to spend a lot of money on their military.

308
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,840
So that they could invade more countries

309
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,404
simply by brute force.

310
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:08,950
The Royal Navy of the British,

311
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,987
was the largest navy in the world then.

312
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:15,438
With its help, Britain could run their large imperialistic empire.

313
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,927
The six great powers of the time,

314
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:19,165
Britain, France, Germany,

315
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:21,074
Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Italy,

316
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:26,007
had combined military spending of around £94 million in 1870.

317
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:27,974
And by 1914,

318
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:29,722
it had increased to four times this.

319
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:32,578
All of these countries were spending a lot of money

320
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:33,779
on military.

321
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,487
These countries were greatly interested in imperialism. 

322
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:40,151
Of capturing as many countries as possible.

323
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:41,988
To extend their empire.

324
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:43,906
Friends, the most interesting thing was that

325
00:14:43,906 --> 00:14:46,047
when I talk about a country here,

326
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:49,254
by 'country' I mostly mean the monarch of the country.

327
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:51,249
The ruler of the empire.

328
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:52,797
Because there weren't democracies.

329
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:54,467
They paid no heed to the people's opinions.

330
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:58,044
The wishes of the one at the top ran the country.

331
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,744
And the monarchs were very ruthless.

332
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,007
Kaiser Wilhelm II was the ruler of Germany then.

333
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:04,925
He is believed to be a hot-tempered ruler.

334
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:09,916
He was always worried about an attack on Germany by France, Britain or Russia.

335
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,068
In Russia, Tsar Nicholas II was having trouble maintaining his position.

336
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:15,583
He was the last emperor of the Russian Empire.

337
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,504
And Britain's Head-of-State was King George V.

338
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:20,023
Wanna know an interesting fact?

339
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:23,616
These three rulers were first cousins of each other.

340
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,235
They literally belonged to the same family.

341
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:27,727
The rulers of 3 countries.

342
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,431
Can you imagine that?

343
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:32,932
World War I was literally a Game of Thrones.

344
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,972
You can think of this as a family feud.

345
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:39,453
It is said that Queen Victoria had tried to get them to stop the war,

346
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:41,219
but after her death,

347
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:43,130
it couldn't be possible.

348
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,632
The fourth reason cited here was the Alliances.

349
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:50,410
There were many political alliances in force among these countries.

350
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,653
The Triple Alliance was formed in 1882,

351
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:55,629
among Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Italy.

352
00:15:55,819 --> 00:15:59,259
These three countries had promised mutual support to each other

353
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:02,218
if any of the Great Powers were attacked.

354
00:16:02,472 --> 00:16:05,097
The second major alliance was formed in 1907,

355
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:07,005
called the Triple Entente.

356
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:09,172
Among Great Britain, France and Russia.

357
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,712
The original reason behind forming these alliances was Imperialism.

358
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:16,258
Since the countries were trying to capture the other countries

359
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:21,185
they'd later feel jealous when some other country captured more countries.

360
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:23,180
They were constantly worried that if such and such country captured any particular region,

361
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,798
they would need to capture more to protect themselves.

362
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:27,190
This was all they did.

363
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,495
In this case, how did the commoners fare?

364
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:34,647
Why would the commoners fight among themselves for their rulers?

365
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:36,981
Did the people want World War I?

366
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:39,935
Friends, the answer to this is mostly no.

367
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,765
But the commoners were still pushed into the war.

368
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,301
The first reason was that the job of the soldier then

369
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:47,896
was for the poor.

370
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:51,176
A common man would become a soldier, put his life at risk,

371
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,833
for the greed of a ruler.

372
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:54,308
Why would someone want to do this?

373
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,664
To earn money.

374
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:57,740
For the lack of employment.

375
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,286
The people that couldn't get employed anywhere else,

376
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:03,796
looked for jobs as soldiers in these countries.

377
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:07,156
It is a different matter to fight a war for to protect one's country

378
00:17:07,156 --> 00:17:10,387
but to capture another country,

379
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:11,990
to invade another country,

380
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:13,759
why would anyone want to fight in a war?

381
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,076
From where would they get the motivation?

382
00:17:15,806 --> 00:17:18,703
The answer to this is the propaganda that used to be spread then.

383
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:20,819
Lingoistic Nationalism.

384
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,185
The newspapers and media at the time,

385
00:17:23,185 --> 00:17:24,675
created an image

386
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,875
that to enlist oneself in the army

387
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,532
was a noble profession.

388
00:17:28,532 --> 00:17:30,532
Labelling it as a selfless service for the country.

389
00:17:30,754 --> 00:17:34,964
Soldiers were shown as gentlemen, disciplined heroes. 

390
00:17:34,964 --> 00:17:37,415
The media started glorifying War.

391
00:17:37,415 --> 00:17:41,492
For example, Britain had gone on the Crimean War against Russia once,

392
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:43,590
and because of a failed military action,

393
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,712
200 British soldiers were killed.

394
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:49,527
But the newspaper exaggerated it so much to highlight it

395
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,549
and the article that was printed in The Times, London,

396
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:04,241
Even though the top leadership made horrible decisions in the battle,

397
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:06,155
due to which soldiers had to lose their lives,

398
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:10,217
it was still shown as a heroic act.

399
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:11,925
The monarch of Britain,

400
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,905
appointed an official poet,

401
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:16,071
Alfred Tennyson.

402
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:19,214
He wrote the poem The Charge of The Light Brigade.

403
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:21,795
This was one of the first poems in the world,

404
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:24,408
that showed a soldier as a hero.

405
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:26,873
Another famous English poet, Rupert Brooke,

406
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:29,819
his poems The Soldier, The Dead,

407
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:33,029
portrayed war and death as glorious things.

408
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,270
He lost his life in World War I.

409
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,819
And Winston Churchill used his poem as a death note,

410
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,000
to recruit more people.

411
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,744
This was the type of was mongering propaganda that was spread then.

412
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:49,766
It was shown that going on a war for "your country" was a great act.

413
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:51,761
I'm putting quotes on 'country' here

414
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:54,504
because there wasn't a democratic country there.

415
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:57,503
The 'country' referred to the rule of the emperor.

416
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:00,330
And you were basically going on a war for the ruler.

417
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,246
But not everyone fell under the influence of the propaganda.

418
00:19:03,246 --> 00:19:06,965
There were many people in these countries who were completely against the war.

419
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:09,756
America's Socialist Party,
the Italian Socialist Party,

420
00:19:09,756 --> 00:19:12,069
British Labour Party,
Russia's Bolsheviks.

421
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:15,088
Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg in Germany.

422
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,032
Apart from them, there were many other groups of people.

423
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,966
Like the Anarchists and Syndicalists

424
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:21,161
who believed in Internationalism.

425
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:24,786
Some people opposed the war on the basis of religion and humanity.

426
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:28,238
Like Henry Ford and Valentine Bulgakov.

427
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:31,468
Additionally, there were poets and intellectuals like Rudyard Kipling as well

428
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:32,978
against the War.

429
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:35,539
You'd recognise him as the author of the Jungle Book.

430
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,921
Against the poem The Charge of The Light Brigade,

431
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:39,599
he wrote a counter poem,

432
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:41,253
The Last of The Light Brigade.

433
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:45,449
It highlights the inhumane conditions that a soldier has to go through

434
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:46,725
while fighting in a war.

435
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:48,882
Similarly, there were poems by Wilfred Owen,

436
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:50,618
that showed the bitter truth of the war.

437
00:19:50,618 --> 00:19:52,064
Poisonous fumes,

438
00:19:52,223 --> 00:19:53,907
wounded limbs,

439
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:55,394
coughing blood,

440
00:19:55,394 --> 00:20:00,979
if you can truly understand the conditions that a soldier has to go through in war,

441
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:04,773
then you would never look at war with enthusiasm.

442
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:09,205
Perhaps the most legendary anti-war poem was written by Thomas Hardy, in 1909.

443
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:10,679
The Man He Killed.

444
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,082
In this poem,

445
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:15,652
he focuses on a soldier that has killed another soldier

446
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:17,417
because both were unemployed

447
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:18,939
they had no work,

448
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:21,038
driven by the need to earn money for their family,

449
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:23,270
they enlisted as soldiers,

450
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,294
fought for their country,

451
00:20:25,294 --> 00:20:27,359
looked at each other and shot at one another.

452
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:33,551
But had the same two people met each other in a restaurant in one of their countries,

453
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:38,056
perhaps they would have merrily sang together and dined

454
00:20:38,056 --> 00:20:39,645
and revelled together.

455
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:41,183
These are the reasons friends that

456
00:20:41,183 --> 00:20:43,609
every soldier that fought in World War I,

457
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,646
did not come under the influence of the terrible war mongering, 

458
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:52,109
and we witnessed several cases of mutinies,

459
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:53,909
There was a case in France where

460
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:55,716
an entire battalion

461
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:57,887
gave up their arms because they didn't want to fight in the war.

462
00:20:57,887 --> 00:21:01,513
In Russia, the soldiers waged a war against their rulers.

463
00:21:01,513 --> 00:21:05,229
But the Christmas Truce of 1914 was the most interesting case.

464
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:08,012
While the war was going on in 1914,

465
00:21:08,012 --> 00:21:09,316
come Christmas,

466
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,459
the British and German soldiers came together

467
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:15,977
to celebrate Christmas on the battlefield.

468
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:43,067
They exchanged food,

469
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,643
sang together

470
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:46,150
and celebrated together.

471
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,253
Because these common folks literally had no reason to fight in this war.

472
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,193
But then their commanders ordered them to stop celebrating

473
00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:55,101
and to continue with the war.

474
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:57,042
They started punishing the soldiers,

475
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:58,578
if they refused to fight,

476
00:21:58,768 --> 00:22:01,912
they would be shot down by their own troops.

477
00:22:01,912 --> 00:22:04,183
If someone deserts from the battles,

478
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:06,466
they would be punished when caught.

479
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:09,172
The soldiers were given such punishments by the country they were fighting for.

480
00:22:09,172 --> 00:22:11,821
To force them to fight in the war.

481
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:14,057
Eventually, World War I happened,

482
00:22:14,057 --> 00:22:17,753
and what exactly happened then, let's talk about that in some future video.

483
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,441
In part 2 of this video, let's talk about

484
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:24,130
the countries that fought in World War II and the countries that won.

485
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,086
And India's involvement in this geopolitical game.

486
00:22:28,276 --> 00:22:30,276
I hope you found the video informative.

487
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:32,725
If you liked it, watch the video on Kargil War too.

488
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:36,773
And I have made several videos on such historical education,

489
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,841
you can watch all of them on this playlist here.

490
00:22:39,095 --> 00:22:41,006
Let's meet in the next video.

491
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:42,108
Thank you very much!
