1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:01,334
This school in Cameroon has

2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,004
extremely dilapidated
and hazardous classrooms.

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,089
No running
water or electricity

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,426
and only a single toilet
shared by over 3000 kids

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,385
and staff daily.

6
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,345
And what's even worse
is despite the school's

7
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,930
mission
to empower young girls

8
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,433
and provide them a safe
haven from domestic abuse

9
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,101
and other challenging
conditions,

10
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,728
many children cannot enroll

11
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:23,148
because of overcrowding and
deteriorating conditions.

12
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,649
So in this video,
we're going

13
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,652
to rebuild the school
from this to this,

14
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,778
this to this

15
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,863
and this to this

16
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,074
to give these kids a better
opportunity at life.

17
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,118
We started out by sending
Dan and Darren

18
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,328
there a few months ago
to see how we could help.

19
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,497
Upon their arrival,
they met with Francis,

20
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,125
an extraordinary man
who has dedicated his life

21
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,128
to combat inequality
and suffering in Cameroon.

22
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,047
He is the founder of CDVTA,

23
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,132
an organization
that helps build wells

24
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,885
facilities and solar power
installations and aids

25
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,429
The development of education
throughout Cameroon.

26
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,056
When we
first visited the school.

27
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,058
What we saw of those
children

28
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,976
were actually
on the conditions

29
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,728
of lack of sanitation.

30
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,063
Some of them were abused.

31
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,065
They had no right
to raise their voice.

32
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,524
They could not speak
for themselves.

33
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,860
These conditions
had no dignity.

34
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,112
These conditions would not
make your child believe that

35
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,823
the future is bright

36
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,159
The kids that are in the

37
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,994
school,
are sitting in classrooms

38
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,413
that are literally made
out of scrap wood.

39
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:20,955
I've been shooting

40
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,791
in one of these classrooms
for 5 minutes

41
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,418
and my face is literally
dripping with sweat.

42
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,503
I can't imagine what it must

43
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,825
be like to sit in here
for an hour long lesson and learn.

44
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,508
The environment
is, first of all dirty.

45
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,634
That is dust all over.

46
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,223
We don't have ceiling boards.

47
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:38,139
The state of these classrooms
is tragic for many reasons,

48
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,600
but mainly because this
school is on the border

49
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,644
of the English and French
parts of Cameroon,

50
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,312
making it a rare junction
point

51
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,023
between two populations
in ongoing conflict.

52
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,359
This school could help unite
these communities.

53
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,444
Many people have moved
from the English part

54
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,987
and is settled in this area.

55
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:56,658
This school became a safe
place for them to come and

56
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,909
get educated here.

57
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,536
But because of the poorly
built

58
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,622
infrastructure, rain leaks
through the roof in winter.

59
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,333
There is no electricity
and the school was beyond

60
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,876
maximum capacity.

61
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,462
Once we saw this, we knew
we had to do something.

62
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,965
- So almost immediately...
- The team quickly

63
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,341
got to work to completely

64
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,552
transform the school
and surprise the kids

65
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,006
before they got
back from their school break.

66
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,998
And before the kids returned
from their holidays,

67
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:29,315
Darren and Dan went to visit
their brand new classrooms.

68
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,233
Darren and I looked

69
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,652
at the new structures
which have airflow.

70
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,324
They have
lights of electricity.

71
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,589
Let there be light!

72
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,949
I can't wait to see
the look on the kids faces.

73
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,034
The teachers faces
when they get to see

74
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,537
the new classrooms,
also the new bathrooms.

75
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,454
The school

76
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,582
is going to transform
thousands

77
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,126
and thousands of lives
in the future.

78
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,086
The next day,
it was finally time

79
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,713
to surprise the kids.

80
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,132
There's a whole bunch of
people outside the school.

81
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,801
This is really exciting.

82
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,512
The school was the busiest
it had ever been, with kids

83
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,972
beyond excited
to get a glimpse

84
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,772
of the brand new classrooms.

85
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,851
I just got out of the car.

86
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,269
There's
a whole bunch of people

87
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,854
over here to welcome me.

88
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,851
This is a little bit crazy.

89
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,734
The headmaster, Dillon,

90
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,110
turned to the new classrooms

91
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,820
where he would
officially cut the ribbon

92
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,739
and declare
the new school open.

93
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,546
When the environment is
beautiful,

94
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,634
academics moves positively
just the happiness,

95
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,137
motivates them psychologically
to study and study well

96
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,723
When interacting
with these kids over here.

97
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,558
I realized that
these are children

98
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,143
that have a thirst to learn.

99
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,604
And providing them
the opportunity to realize

100
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,648
that is
probably the best legacy

101
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,775
that we'll leave behind
in this community.

102
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:58,112
I can't imagine the impact
this will have on the lives

103
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,865
of children in this school.
Thank you.

104
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:01,699
Thank you.

105
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,702
And thank you very much
indeed.

106
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,788
Before I show you
an unexpected surprise

107
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,081
the community
had for Darren,

108
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,041
I want to tell you
about the amazing sponsor

109
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:10,959
of this video,

110
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,460
Lectric E-Bikes

111
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,420
They're back on board
and supporting our mission

112
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,463
with their affordable,

113
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,757
eco friendly and fun to ride
bikes.

114
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,633
Time and time again,

115
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,842
they've
shown their dedication

116
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,344
to a global impact
by helping us

117
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,512
rebuild an orphanage,

118
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,013
donating thousands of shoes

119
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,974
to kids in South Africa
and distributing

120
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,892
millions of clothes
worldwide.

121
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,269
Additionally,
they helped us power

122
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,229
an island in Colombia,

123
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,815
a children's sanctuary
in Zambia, and give away

124
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,276
hundreds of electric bikes
all across the globe.

125
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,279
And now, for the eighth time
this year, they stepped up

126
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,989
and helped us build
this school in Cameroon.

127
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,031
So I just want to
give a heartfelt

128
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,032
thank you to Lectric E-Bikes

129
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,659
for their continuous
support.

130
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,119
Let's get back to the video.

131
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,539
Now it is
time for Darren's surprise.

132
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,166
So the village leaders
took him to a ceremonial hut

133
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,795
and dressed him up
in local attire.

134
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,214
He then took part
in a traditional Cameroonian

135
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,174
induction
as a village elder.

136
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:03,720
What?!

137
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:05,595
Forefathers.

138
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:10,263
Hold it now.

139
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:11,931
Hold it... 
Yeah!

140
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,069
I've just been honored
as a chief in the village.

141
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,280
Now that Darren
had finally become a chief,

142
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,907
it was time to say goodbye
to Cameroon and these kids.

143
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,035
We can't wait
to come back soon to visit.

144
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,745
By watching this video,
you helped us

145
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,705
generate some ad revenue
so we can continue

146
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,665
to do philanthropic projects
all around the world.

147
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,334
And you've told the YouTube
algorithm

148
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,293
you like the video,

149
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,878
so they'll recommend it
to more people.

150
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,588
And for that,
we are very grateful.

151
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,089
And if you want to continue
to support

152
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,758
Francis
and the many communities

153
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,051
he helps throughout
Cameroon,

154
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,886
you can donate directly
to his charity

155
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,929
using the donate button
or the link to description.

156
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,390
All the proceeds
will go to Francis and CDVTA

157
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,558
so they can continue to help
build

158
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,976
a better future
for these children.

159
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,603
Thank you so
much for watching. Subscribe
