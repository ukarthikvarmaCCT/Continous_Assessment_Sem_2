1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,034
The Israel-Palestine war began over a month ago,

3
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:07,578
over 10,000 lives have been lost already.

4
00:00:07,578 --> 00:00:11,664
Surprisingly, amidst this tragedy, 
certain entities are benefiting significantlyâ€”

5
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:14,706
American weapons manufacturers.

6
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:17,021
Since the war began, the stocks of these companies

7
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:19,912
have surged by $30 billion.

8
00:00:19,912 --> 00:00:22,237
The two major defense contractors in America

9
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:24,425
Raytheon and General Dynamics

10
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,882
have unabashedly informed investors

11
00:00:26,882 --> 00:00:29,971
that the war in Israel 
would be financially advantageous.

12
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:34,244
Other arms manufacturers like 
Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman

13
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:38,317
have experienced substantial 
stock gains over the past three years.

14
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:44,644
Lockheed Martin produces 
F-35 Lightning II fighter jets used by Israel,

15
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,964
as well as Black Hawk helicopters,

16
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:50,436
Northrop Grumman produces submarines and combat vehicles.

17
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:55,201
Israel signed a $3 billion deal in July

18
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:58,010
to buy these F-35 fighter jets.

19
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:02,762
One might wonder about the source 
of Israel's substantial military budget.

20
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,510
An obvious answer would be

21
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,900
that it is Israeli taxpayers fund.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,309
But look at this news article.

23
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:11,959
In September 2016, during President Obama's tenure,

24
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:16,202
the U.S. and Israel signed a $38 billion deal,

25
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:23,538
as per this deal, the US provides military equipment 
worth $3.8 billion to Israel annually.

26
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:28,716
Consequently, a staggering 92% of Israel's imported weapons now

27
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:31,063
originate from one country.

28
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:33,063
The United States of America.

29
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:38,971
But why does this matter?

30
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:43,282
A country buying weapons from an ally 
country would not seem suspicious. 

31
00:01:43,282 --> 00:01:45,067
But the peculiarity of this situation is that

32
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:48,806
the weapons industry doesn't care about any alliances. 

33
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:51,308
The weapons industry has only one objective

34
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:52,803
earning maximum profit.

35
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:55,770
This year, in January, the U.S. State Department announced

36
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,854
a record-breaking $205 billion in weapon sales

37
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:02,279
to various countries worldwide

38
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,995
in the latest fiscal year.

39
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:08,733
Weapons worth more than $200 Billion 
were sold in a year by only one country. 

40
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:13,169
Marking a 49% increase from the previous year.

41
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:16,831
These weapons went to 58 different countries,

42
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:18,373
including not only Israel but also

43
00:02:18,373 --> 00:02:20,688
several Arab nations such as Lebanon, Saudi Arabia,

44
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:23,399
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,

45
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,767
Bahrain, and Iraq.

46
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:27,945
Does selling these weapons make the world a safer place?

47
00:02:27,945 --> 00:02:28,895
Or unsafe?

48
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:30,688
The issue extends beyond the United States;

49
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:34,022
last year, Israel also set a record in weapon sales,

50
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:36,943
surpassing $12 billion.

51
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:40,827
This substantial figure includes sales of 
drones, missiles, rockets, and air defense systems.

52
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:45,419
Notably, $3 billion or the %12 billion
that is, 24% of this total export

53
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,162
was to Arab countries.

54
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:50,204
Israel ranks as the 10th largest arms exporter globally,

55
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:52,156
with the top four positions occupied by

56
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:54,499
the United States, Russia, France, and China.

57
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:56,676
The United Kingdom holds the 7th position.

58
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,756
What distinguishes these five countries is

59
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:04,009
their status as permanent members of 
the United Nations Security Council.

60
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,107
A striking fact is that combining their weapon sales

61
00:03:07,107 --> 00:03:12,214
constitutes over 75% of global arms exports.

62
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:13,978
After this fact comes to light,

63
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:15,842
how can one expect that

64
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:18,294
the United Nations would adopt a resolution

65
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:20,803
to curtail arms exports globally?

66
00:03:20,803 --> 00:03:23,776
In May of this year, Oxfam International's
Head of New York office highlighted that

67
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,175
four out of the five permanent 
members of the UN Security Council

68
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,451
are the world's leading arms sellers.

69
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:33,714
These weapons fuel conflicts worldwide.

70
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,258
This is truly hypocritical, complicit, and immoral.

71
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,382
Apart from them, Germany, Italy, and South Korea

72
00:03:39,382 --> 00:03:42,297
also feature among the top 10 arms exporters.

73
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:44,857
The weapons industry isn't bothered by

74
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:48,148
what's right and what's wrong,
who is an ally and who is not.

75
00:03:48,148 --> 00:03:49,957
This is evident in several examples.

76
00:03:49,957 --> 00:03:53,346
While many consider Russia a close friend to India,

77
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:57,263
it is also one of the top three arms exporters to Pakistan.

78
00:03:57,263 --> 00:03:59,574
Between 2017 and 2021

79
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:02,602
China was the #1 weapons supplier to Pakistan, 

80
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:03,859
followed by Sweden

81
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:05,110
and Russia.

82
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,824
Look at this report from 2021.

83
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:10,482
Russia pledged to provide more weapons to Pakistan,

84
00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:12,863
despite India's discomfort.

85
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:15,373
Turning to weapon imports,

86
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:18,024
the top countries importing weapons are

87
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,317
on this list of Top 10 Largest Arms Importers.

88
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:21,926
India is at number one,

89
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:24,428
followed by countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

90
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:26,228
However, what's interesting here is that

91
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:28,528
in positions 5th, 7th, and 10th

92
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:32,130
reveal an intriguing dynamic with 
China, South Korea, and America.

93
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,705
This suggests a complex game

94
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:39,442
of buying and selling weapons on the global stage,

95
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:44,027
Seemingly unaffected by a country's foreign policy.

96
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:45,621
In the realm of geopolitics,

97
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:48,399
the U.S. aligns with Israel,

98
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,836
while Russia and China form a separate bloc,

99
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:54,685
even in the current crisis, these two sides are evident.

100
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:58,135
Russian President Putin's opinion 
on the Israel-Palestine war is that

101
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:00,832
it should be seen as a failure of the U.S. policy,

102
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:03,406
Asserting that the US neglects the well-being of Palestinians.

103
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:06,803
China, too, condemns Israel's actions in Gaza,

104
00:05:06,803 --> 00:05:09,131
characterizing them as "beyond self-defense".

105
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:11,765
This might create the impression of a divide, 
with the U.S., Europe, and Israel on one side,

106
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:13,590
and China and Russia on the other.

107
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,405
However, when it comes to weapon exports,

108
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:18,818
these seemingly opposing nations 
find themselves on the same side.

109
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,539
These countries collectively export the most weapons globally.

110
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,827
By now you might be thinking that 
these countries are truly terrible.

111
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:31,871
That we should be protesting the countries exporting weapons worldwide.

112
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:34,767
But if you are thinking so, you are missing the point.

113
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,111
A nation is formed by its citizens.

114
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:38,685
Americans aren't bad.

115
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:41,561
Neither are Russians, Israelis, or Chinese citizens.

116
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:43,540
The citizens aren't actually consulted.

117
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,652
The major players in this deadly weapons mafia

118
00:05:45,652 --> 00:05:49,663
are not everyday Americans, 
Russians, Israelis, or Chinese citizens.

119
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:53,860
Ordinary people in these nations don't reap the benefits of arms sales;

120
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,237
instead, private weapons manufacturers are the ones raking in profits.

121
00:05:58,237 --> 00:05:59,254
That's right.

122
00:05:59,254 --> 00:06:04,364
Almost all of the weapons sold globally by these countries

123
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,456
aren't sold by the governments,
rather they're sold by private capitalists.

124
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:09,966
Look at this list.

125
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:12,021
The top 100 weapons companies.

126
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:13,353
Out of the top 100 companies,

127
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:15,497
only a handful are government-owned,

128
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:17,342
such as Israel Aerospace Industries or

129
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:20,035
Aviation Industry Corporation of China.

130
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:22,329
Disregarding these exceptions,

131
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:24,668
the majority are private entities.

132
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:28,176
Lockheed Martin, an American company, holds the top spot,

133
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:30,457
followed by Northrop Grumman in third place.

134
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:34,722
In fact, 51 of the companies on the list are American.

135
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:36,025
What does this mean?

136
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:39,343
The massive profits generated from the sale of weapons

137
00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:41,572
flow into the coffers of these private companies.

138
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:44,815
Ironically, the money used to purchase these weapons often comes from

139
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:51,670
taxpayers, as governments fund these acquisitions.

140
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,356
Many nations procure weapons either
from private companies in their country

141
00:06:56,356 --> 00:06:58,674
or, when dealing with other countries,

142
00:06:58,674 --> 00:07:01,676
they engage with private entities of that country.

143
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:04,168
Hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money,

144
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:07,699
are funnelled into these companies.

145
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:10,576
These funds are then utilized to purchase weapons,

146
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:16,706
which inevitably end up being used in 
conflicts that affect ordinary people.

147
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:20,675
A report by the Stockholm International 
Peace Research Institute in April this year

148
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:22,838
revealed that India's military spending

149
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:26,202
stands at $81.4 billion,

150
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:29,010
ranking it fourth globally in 2022.

151
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,006
At the forefront of military expenditures is America

152
00:07:32,006 --> 00:07:34,432
with $877 billion,

153
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:38,101
followed by China at $292 billion,

154
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:40,700
and Russia at $86.4 billion.

155
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,962
The top 10 list also features the UK and France,

156
00:07:44,962 --> 00:07:48,899
all five permanent members of 
the United Nations Security Council

157
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:50,267
are on this list too.

158
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:53,523
Why don't these 5 nations collectively decide

159
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:56,830
to cease the wasteful spending on weapons?

160
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,670
A united commitment to refrain from attacking one another

161
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,183
could be a transformative step to 
halt the financial drain on military budgets.

162
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:03,053
However, the irony lies in the fact that

163
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:06,214
the primary casualties of the weapons industry

164
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:08,140
are often the American citizens.

165
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,188
The frequency of mass shootings in America

166
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:13,154
is alarmingly higher than any other country.

167
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:17,045
This year alone, till mid-September, 
over 500 mass shootings occurred,

168
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:19,998
with a tragic impact on children,

169
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:23,246
making "School Shootings" a 
distressingly common phrase in America.

170
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:28,231
In 2021-2022, more than 327 school 
shootings took place in American schools.

171
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:32,688
This is a direct result of the lax regulation 
surrounding gun ownership in America.

172
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:35,001
Unlike in other countries where disputes

173
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:36,467
are settled with fists and kicks.

174
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,450
But in America, people do not hesitate to fire guns.

175
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,922
Only because of the fact that the American laws

176
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:42,562
favour gun ownership.

177
00:08:42,562 --> 00:08:44,618
If the sale of weapons were prohibited, 

178
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:46,803
no one would be allowed to sell weapons,

179
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:49,092
then these gun shootings would stop eventually. 

180
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:52,590
But how would the weapon manufacturers benefit then?

181
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,297
This is why dozens of children lose 
their lives in America every year,

182
00:08:56,297 --> 00:08:58,100
politicians are often seen shedding tears,

183
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,492
but the gun trade isn't affected.

184
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:02,396
Disturbingly, between 2005 and 2020,

185
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:04,719
gun sales in America tripled.

186
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:10,486
In the previous year alone, Americans 
purchased a staggering 16.6 million guns.

187
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:13,096
The government can easily 
change this if it wanted to.

188
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:17,116
Governments do not need to bow down to the weapons industry.

189
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:18,815
Take Australia for example,

190
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:22,395
once known for lax gun regulations, 

191
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:29,501
but in April 1996, when a 28-year-old man 
k!lled 35 people with a semi-automatic rifle,

192
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:31,373
"Gunman k!lls 25 people

193
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:33,285
in Australia's worst massacre."

194
00:09:33,285 --> 00:09:35,002
"The situation remains tense at the

195
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,332
Port Arthur side."

196
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:37,450
Following this mass shooting,

197
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,125
Australian Prime Minister John Howard took decisive action

198
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,812
to address the issue of firearms.

199
00:09:42,812 --> 00:09:45,595
The National Firearms Agreement 
was implemented a month later.

200
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:49,274
Between October 1996 and September 1997,

201
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:54,468
the government seized over 650,000 privately owned guns.

202
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,859
The gun owners were given monetary compensation

203
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:59,879
to surrender their firearms to the government.

204
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,570
People who had guns illegally weren't compensated,

205
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,986
but legal amnesty was provided to them,

206
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:09,331
they didn't face prosecution for 
voluntarily turning in their illegal weapons.

207
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:13,107
As a result, today, in Australia,

208
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:15,081
such mass shootings are rarely seen, if ever.

209
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,992
Something similar happened in Serbia earlier this year.

210
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,215
Following two shootings in May

211
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:22,415
resulting in 17 d3aths, including children,

212
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:25,253
the government declared a one-month amnesty period

213
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:28,698
for citizens to surrender their unregistered weapons.

214
00:10:28,698 --> 00:10:32,048
"Recent mass shootings which left 17 people d3ad

215
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,223
and 21 wounded,

216
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:34,873
have sparked public outrage.

217
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:36,698
Authorities have also declared

218
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:38,198
a one-month amnesty period

219
00:10:38,198 --> 00:10:41,216
for citizens to handover unregistered weapons,

220
00:10:41,216 --> 00:10:43,199
or face prison sentences."

221
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:47,415
Over 13,500 weapons were 
voluntarily surrendered within a week.

222
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:49,379
Later, this date was extended,

223
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:52,656
and within 2 months, more than 100,000 illegal weapons

224
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:54,475
were handed over to the government.

225
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:57,225
It shows that with political will, governments can

226
00:10:57,225 --> 00:11:00,912
effectively control the weapons and mitigate violence.

227
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:03,843
For those interested in delving deeper into American history,

228
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:06,462
there's an audiobook available on Kuku FM

229
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:08,453
about the American Civil War,

230
00:11:08,453 --> 00:11:10,500
Kuku FM is abrilliant audio-learning platform,

231
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,021

00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,840
on almost every topic.

233
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,721
In the history and geopolitics genre,

234
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:18,249
there are several audiobooks.

235
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,796
Such as on the creation of Israel,

236
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:23,690
or the Israel-Palestine war 
and the Russia-Ukraine war.

237
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,820
There are audiobooks on these topics.

238
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,977
Listeners can enjoy these audiobooks 
when they prefer to rest their eyes.

239
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:31,873
For those new to KUKU FM,

a special 50% discount coupon is available in the description,

241
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:39,631
along with links to the mentioned audiobooks.

242
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:41,877
And now let's get back to our topic.

243
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:47,028
In certain regions, the influence of the weapons 
mafia has expanded beyond arms sales.

244
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:50,793
Private companies are not only profiting from selling weapons

245
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,268
but have ventured into providing private armies,

246
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:57,350
commonly known as Mercenaries.

247
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,628
During the Russia-Ukraine war,

248
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:00,704
the Wagner group gained attention

249
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:03,425
for attempting to overthrow Putin from the government.

250
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:05,434
Considered by Putin as an anti-national force,

251
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,166
the group was subsequently disbanded.

252
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,817
But do you know how did this group form?

253
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:12,582
The Wagner group originated in Russia,

254
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:15,122
Putin had said that this group

255
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:17,271
received funding from the state budget,

256
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:19,360
a fact that was initially denied for years.

257
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,319
Putin eventually admitted to allocating 
$1 billion to the group in a year.

258
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:27,408
Dmitry Kiselyov, the head of the state-
controlled Russian media group,

259
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:33,826
stated that the Wagner group was provided 
a total of $9.8 billion by the Russian government.

260
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:38,270
Remarkably, taxpayer money was 
used to finance private armies.

261
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,673
The logical question arises:

262
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:42,563
Why didn't Russia use its army?

263
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:45,473
Why opt to hire private mercenary groups?

264
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:49,518
The primary motivation behind this decision 
is cost-effectiveness.

265
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,590
In a wartime scenario,

266
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,407
providing funds to a private company

267
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,999
allows the company's private army to 
fight the war on behalf of the country.

268
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:57,914
Deploying the national army is very bothersome.

269
00:12:57,914 --> 00:12:59,637
In the form of various financial obligations, 
such as pension payments,

270
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:03,822
army officers' salaries, health insurance,

271
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:07,601
and compensations for families of martyrs.

272
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:10,319
Choosing to hire contract fighters is better because

273
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:12,021
once the country makes a payment to the company,

274
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:13,462
the company bears all other responsibilities.

275
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:15,720
Even if a mercenary of the private army d!es fighting,

276
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,775
they aren't included in the official casualty counts.

277
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:22,471
While headlines may report the number of 
Russian or Ukrainian soldiers k!lled,

278
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:24,803
a third category exists,

279
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,890
private army soldiers fighting

280
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,230
who were neither Russian nor Ukrainian,

281
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,494
but were fighting on behalf of Russia.

282
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:34,596
Their d3aths may not garner 
significant attention or discussion.

283
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:39,461
You might be wondering who would want to fight 
as a part of a private company's armies.

284
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:42,500
Friends, mercenaries often hail from 
economically disadvantaged countries,

285
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,358
driven by financial constraints and limited job opportunities,

286
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:48,524
they often join the army of these private companies.

287
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:52,222
These private armies are not only 
contracted by governments

288
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:55,518
but also by private companies and warlords.

289
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:58,292
The Wagner Group, for instance, 
engaged in conflicts beyond Ukraine,

290
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:00,744
including countries like Syria, Sudan Mozambique,

291
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:05,755
Mali, Burkina Faso, and Libya.

292
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:08,859
In these impoverished nations, they are 
frequently employed in mining contracts.

293
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:14,641
The private mining companies that make money 
by selling the resources of these poor nations,

294
00:14:14,641 --> 00:14:17,266
hire these private armies so that

295
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:21,414
they could quell local protests,

296
00:14:21,414 --> 00:14:24,329
Companies by Yevgeny Prigozhin mined for gold,

297
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:27,650
uranium, and diamonds, particularly in

298
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,213
countries such as Sudan, Mali, Libya, 
and the Central African Republic.

299
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:35,355
These private armies k!lled hundreds of innocent civilians,

300
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:38,749
looting houses, harassing activists, 
and even k!lling journalists.

301
00:14:38,749 --> 00:14:41,641
The Wagner Group is not the only private military company.

302
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:44,976
Russia has also employed other private military companies.

303
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:48,741
Like POTOK, Don Brigade, Moran Security Group,

304
00:14:48,741 --> 00:14:52,775
and Slavonic Corps, ENOT Corp, to name a few.

305
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,675
Russia isn't the only one to do so.

306
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:58,005
For instance, Yair Klein, a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Israeli Army,

307
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:01,925
established Spearhead Limited, a mercenary group

308
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:05,831
that supplied weapons, trained d3ath squads,

309
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:09,132
in right-wing paramilitary groups in Colombia.

310
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:14,240
Additionally, organized militias for 
drug traffickers like Pablo Escobar. 

311
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,730
Despite the Colombian government seeking to arrest him,

312
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,659
Klein, just like other wealthy individuals, 
managed to evade legal consequences.

313
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:24,573
Israel is renowned for its cyber mercenaries

314
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:27,917
who engage in cybercrimes for money,

315
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:32,439
including hacking, forging blackmail material, disinformation spreading,

316
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:35,702
planting false intelligence, and surveillance.

317
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:39,264
Team George, an Israeli cyber mercenary group,

318
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:43,062
interfered in 33 presidential campaigns,

319
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:45,207
successfully influencing 27.

320
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:51,262
Facebook exposed and banned 7 cyber 
mercenary companies in December 2021,

321
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:54,681
These companies had targetted almost 50,000 people worldwide. 

322
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:57,823
Four of these were Israeli cyber-mercenaries,

323
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,189
like Black Cube and Cobwebs.

324
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,760
Apart from this, you would have heard of Pegasus,

325
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,251
an infamous spyware sold to governments worldwide,

326
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:09,516
this was being sold by an Israeli private company.

327
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:12,875
An Israeli private cyber mercenary group 
called the NSO Group.

328
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:13,973
Talking about America,

329
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,573
between 1994 and 2007,

330
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:21,054
approximately $300 billion was spent on 12 private militias.

331
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:24,407
One of these private military company is Blackwater, 

332
00:16:24,407 --> 00:16:27,859
founded by former US Navy officer Eric Prince.

333
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:30,320
Blackwater hires fighters from various countries,

334
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,159
including the Philippines, Bosnia, Israel, and Chile,

335
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,847
selling its private services for money.

336
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:36,461
In September 2007,

337
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:40,138
Blackwater gained notoriety when its mercenaries

338
00:16:40,138 --> 00:16:42,891
k!lled 17 innocent Iraqi civilians.

339
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:45,273
Although four individuals were initially being prosecuted,

340
00:16:45,273 --> 00:16:50,542
they were pardoned in 2020 
during Donald Trump's presidency.

341
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,991
Blackwater's involvement has contributed to 
the escalation of numerous wars worldwide.

342
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:57,316
In December 2021, a United Nations report

343
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,451
accused Eric Prince of

344
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,295
violating the weapons ban in Libya.

345
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:04,515
The ongoing conflict in Libya,

346
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:07,204
is now characterized as a private war.

347
00:17:07,204 --> 00:17:11,662
Look at this news article stating that 
Blackwater was hired by the Obama government 

348
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:14,819
to provide security in Afghanistan in 2010,

349
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,731
at a cost of $220 million,

350
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:21,366
public tax money was handed over 
to these private armies.

351
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:24,243
Fast forward to 2021 when the Taliban 
regained control of Afghanistan;

352
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,425
reports from the Wall Street Journal revealed that

353
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:30,655
Eric Prince was charging $6,500 per person

354
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:35,279
to facilitate safe evacuations from 
Afghanistan on charter flights.

355
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:37,286
During the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in America,

356
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:40,744
Blackwater secured a $73 million contract

357
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:45,403
to assist the FEMA staff during the 
Katrina-aftermath recovery operation,

358
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:55,469
Not only this, Eric Prince has also made 
significant political donations to Republican politicians.

359
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:59,146
This intertwining of financial contributions and business transactions

360
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:01,677
works quite well here.

361
00:18:01,677 --> 00:18:03,191
The only difference is that

362
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:06,132
not only are the super-rich businessmen corrupt,

363
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:08,620
but they're dealing in weapons transactions,

364
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,390
k!lling people all over the world.

365
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,367
Eric Prince handed donations to politicians

366
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:17,458
and the politicians handed his company,
Blackwater, contracts worth $800 million.

367
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,964
In Iraq, over 160,000 Blackwater employees

368
00:18:20,964 --> 00:18:24,674
served as guards for U.S. officials.

369
00:18:24,674 --> 00:18:27,463
An internal report from Blackwater disclosed that,

370
00:18:27,463 --> 00:18:31,011
among 195 shooting incidents in the last two years,

371
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:35,751
the company's employees shot the first bullet in 160 instances.

372
00:18:37,172 --> 00:18:38,670
It's also quite common

373
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,565
for politicians to invest in stocks 
of these private contractor companies,

374
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:44,421
thereby becoming direct shareholders.

375
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:48,051
This goes beyond a mere bribery situation. 

376
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:51,196
Any benefit made by the company
would directly benefit the politician.

377
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:55,253
George Bush was the US President during the Iraq invasion,

378
00:18:55,253 --> 00:18:58,701
his father was a Board member of the Carlyle Group.

379
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:01,454
This same group was awarded numerous defense contracts,

380
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:03,591
through companies like Vought and United Defense. 

381
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:06,111
Furthermore, the then U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney,

382
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,272
used to be the head of the company Halliburton,

383
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:13,230
which received a $7 billion defense contract 
without any competitive bidding.

384
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,509
The same company was awarded 
contracts to restore the oil sector in Iraq.

385
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:20,299
Now, many people allege

386
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,905
that the real reason behind the Iraq war was

387
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:24,070
Iraq's oil.

388
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,247
Oil companies like Halliburton, 
Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP, and Shell

389
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,571
established themselves in Iraq.

390
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,273
As of December 2021,

391
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:35,838
there are at least 15 influential politicians in America

392
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:38,651
actively shaping U.S. defense policy,

393
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:41,967
who have personal investments in these military contractors.

394
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:44,328
They are directing U.S. military policy

395
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:48,861
while profiting from these arms-selling 
companies by holding their stocks.

396
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:51,767
Can there be a more drastic conflict of interest?

397
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:53,977
By now, two key points should be clear:

398
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:56,408
First, in wars like the Israel-Palestine situation,

399
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:59,236
the weapons industry reaps significant benefits.

400
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:01,859
Second, politicians benefit off of it too

401
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:03,797
since they are personally invested in it.

402
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:07,805
especially those who have investments 
in these weapon manufacturing companies.

403
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:09,442
Adding to this, the third point emerges:

404
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,218
politicians often derive political benefits from wars.

405
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:14,859
As poet Rahat Indori noted,

406
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:16,797
 

407
00:20:16,797 --> 00:20:18,624
[Are tensions erupting on the borders?
Find out if its time for elections.]

408
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:22,790
When politicians have to answer for 
issues like corruption and unemployment,

409
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,807
they can use wars to divert public attention.

410
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,873
Especially for dictators,

411
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:30,340
war serves as an effective distraction.

412
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,698
George Orwell's novel "1984" emphasizes the idea that

413
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:36,217
war should perpetually go on,

414
00:20:36,217 --> 00:20:38,301
not necessarily to win,

415
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:41,292
but to continue fighting it

416
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:43,258
to maintain and consolidate power.

417
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:55,225
Think about it for yourself.

418
00:20:55,225 --> 00:20:58,024
India refrains from attacking other nations,

419
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,829
that's a matter of national pride.

420
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:06,094
In India, the military expenditures are 
primarily directed towards self-defense,

421
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:10,117
especially against neighbouring countries like Pakistan and China,

422
00:21:10,117 --> 00:21:11,975
However, when analyzing China's behavior,

423
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:15,035
questions arise: Why does China 
keep on encroaching on our borders?

424
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:18,981
Does a farmer in Shanghai benefit from the Chinese intrusion?

425
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:22,660
Or some school teacher in Beijing?

426
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,720
No.

427
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,441
This muscle-flexing and chest-thumping 
mainly serves leaders like Xi Jinping,

428
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:30,413
helping them consolidate and sustain power.

429
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:34,649
In foreign policy, such politicians are labelled "hawkish",

430
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:39,059
while those advocating for peace are termed "doves".

431
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:44,182
Hawkish politicians often use 
public tax money to fortify their positions,

432
00:21:44,182 --> 00:21:46,123
In reality, during wars, 

433
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:48,516
it's the common people who end up fighting each other,

434
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,492
not the politicians themselves.

435
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:52,009
An example from 2014 highlights this:

436
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:55,106
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's son

437
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,966
had started his mandatory three-year army service.

438
00:21:57,966 --> 00:21:59,938
However, this turned out to be fake news,

439
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:04,317
misleading the public into thinking his son 
was directly involved in the conflict.

440
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:06,554
Critics have rightfully condemned

441
00:22:06,554 --> 00:22:09,724
him for sending his son to 
enjoy life at some American beach,

442
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:12,122
while sending ordinary citizens to fight.

443
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:15,975
These issues should prompt the media to 
raise their voices and provide critical coverage. 

444
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:18,620
Unfortunately, in many countries, 
the media is often so corrupt

445
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,919
that it looks to benefit from wars,

446
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:24,640
eagerly chasing the prospect of increased 
TRP by talking about the latest conflict.

447
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,986
Especially those TV channels
aligned with government's interest,

448
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:29,900
they find it convenient

449
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:35,123
to neglect the day-to-day issues faced by the common people

450
00:22:35,123 --> 00:22:37,827
and focus solely on war-related news.

451
00:22:37,827 --> 00:22:40,459
This highlights a stark truth about 
the world's weapons industry:

452
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,900
an industry whose existence would be jeopardized 

453
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,140
if global wars were to cease. 

454
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,533
Perhaps this is why it is beneficial

455
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,934
to continue wars to ensure the continuous flow of money.

456
00:22:51,934 --> 00:22:53,495
