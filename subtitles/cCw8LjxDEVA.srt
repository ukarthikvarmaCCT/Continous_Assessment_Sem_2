1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,424
Did you hear the news?

3
00:00:02,424 --> 00:00:05,115
I'm going to make a wildcard entry in Bigg Boss!

4
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:07,651
So many media houses have published this news.

5
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:09,343
India TV, India Times,

6
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,915
ABP News, India Today,

7
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:13,506
Zoom TV, Pinkvilla, Economic Times.

8
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:14,645
I mean, look at this headline.

9
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:16,416
"Popular YouTuber Dhruv Rathee

10
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,329
set to make a wildcard entry

11
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:19,699
in Bigg Boss OTT 2."

12
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:21,882
One website has confirmed this.

13
00:00:21,882 --> 00:00:24,360
Dhruv Rathee Bigg Boss OTT Entry Confirmed!

14
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,766
So is this true?

15
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:26,751
No!

16
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:30,683
Till now no one has asked me to go on Bigg Boss this season

17
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:33,280
and neither have I told anyone that I want to go on Bigg Boss.

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,936
So first of all,

19
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:38,009
this tells you the standard of our Indian media.

20
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:40,175
They will publish anything without any hesitation.

21
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:43,045
Scroll down and see the article in Economic Times,

22
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:44,311
there is a disclaimer.

23
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,836
"This content is authored by a 3rd party.

24
00:00:46,836 --> 00:00:48,659

25
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:51,245
to ascertain that any information and content provided

26
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:52,989
is correct, updated, and verified."

27
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:55,565
They do not take responsibility for the materials they post.

28
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:59,370
They shift the responsibility on you to ascertain whether the news is true or not.

29
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,939
And the second thing here is that

30
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:03,064
some of you would be wondering,

31
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,155
if I am invited to Big Boss,

32
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:06,737
will I go on Big Boss?

33
00:01:06,737 --> 00:01:07,624
No!

34
00:01:08,422 --> 00:01:09,737
Let me say this clearly,

35
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,971
even if they offer to pay me to be on the show,

36
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:16,893
hundreds of thousands, millions, any amount of money,

37
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:19,905
I will never go to such a nonsense show in my life.

38
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:23,753
In my opinion, this is a very cheap way to earn money and fame

39
00:01:23,753 --> 00:01:25,585
which has a bad impact on society.

40
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,052
So in today's video, I would like to explain

41
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:30,749
what is problematic in the concept of this show?

42
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:32,198
Is this show scripted?

43
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:34,618
And why you should not watch such shows at all.

44
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:36,421
If you or any of your family members

45
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:38,534
waste their time watching Bigg Boss,

46
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:40,085
then this video is for you.

47
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:47,347
"Now, there's news of

48
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:49,229
famous YouTuber Dhruv Rathee's

49
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,545
possible wildcard entry in Big Boss."

50
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,941
Once, this guy Siddharth Yadav,

51
00:01:57,941 --> 00:01:59,581
made a YouTube video in which

52
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:02,100
he said that there are so many jobless people in our country

53
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,406
who watch Salman Khan's movies

54
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:05,966
that have neither heads nor tails.

55
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:07,601
"This gives you an idea

56
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:09,743
of how many jobless people we have in our country

57
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:11,328
who enjoy watching such movies

58
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,020
that make no sense.

59
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,208
But because it is Salman Khan's movie

60
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:15,406
even if the ticket costs thousand rupees,

61
00:02:15,406 --> 00:02:16,799
they need to watch Salman Khan's movies,

62
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:17,579
regardless of anything."

63
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:18,999
He was somewhat right.

64
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:20,868
We shouldn't consume any content

65
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:23,546
that doesn't have any intellectual or profound content,

66
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:24,827
that aren't productive.

67
00:02:24,827 --> 00:02:25,981
It's a different matter that

68
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:27,867
he is in Bigg Boss' house now.

69
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,477
But it's also true that

70
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:36,213
Bigg Boss is the most apt place for this type of person.

71
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:38,601
People like him deserve to go on Bigg Boss

72
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:39,645
and, in fact, to win it.

73
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:41,365
I'm sure he can win this show.

74
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:43,320
Because there are some specific qualities

75
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,734
that are required for this show's concept.

76
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:48,188
Based on which this show can run.

77
00:02:48,188 --> 00:02:49,855
I'll tell you about that later in the video

78
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:51,014
but first,

79
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:52,372
let's know the history of this show.

80
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,094
How did this show begin?

81
00:02:54,094 --> 00:02:56,823
In 1949, writer George Orwell

82
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:58,548
published a legendary novel

83
00:02:58,548 --> 00:03:00,523
called 1984.

84
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:04,324
This book talks about a dictator-dystopian government,

85
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:06,173
which is headed by

86
00:03:06,173 --> 00:03:08,039
an unknown Big Brother.

87
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,175
Posters are put up everywhere,

88
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:11,827
Big Brother is watching you.

89
00:03:11,827 --> 00:03:13,649
The dictatorial government

90
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:15,313
is always watching you.

91
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:16,741
In 1999,

92
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:18,837
some guys in the Netherlands

93
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:21,063
took a similar concept from this novel

94
00:03:21,063 --> 00:03:22,897
and turned it into a TV show,

95
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:25,892
which they named Big Brother.

96
00:03:25,892 --> 00:03:27,444
The concept of this show was that

97
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:29,052
some people would live in a house

98
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,645
under constant surveillance

99
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,705
and under the command of Big Brother.

100
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:35,046
To shape the format of this TV show,

101
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:37,767
they took inspiration from some older TV shows also.

102
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,693
Such as the MTV reality show

103
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:40,788
The Real World

104
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:43,166
and a 1997 Swedish TV show

105
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,675
Expedition Robinson.

106
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:46,854
After a while, this show became very popular

107
00:03:46,854 --> 00:03:48,874
and started spreading all over the world.

108
00:03:48,874 --> 00:03:50,371
Copying this concept,

109
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:51,775
America, Canada, Mexico,

110
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,191
Brazil, Argentina, Australia,

111
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,909
Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines,

112
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:56,162
China, and Russia,

113
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:58,615
made their Big Brothers.

114
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:00,067
And when it comes to copying,

115
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:02,741
the Indian entertainment industry can't lag behind.

116
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:06,316
Big Brother was made into Big Boss in India.

117
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:08,725
It was soon launched in different languages.

118
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:10,574
After Hindi, came Marathi, Tamil, Bengali,

119
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:12,137
Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam.

120
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:13,766
Then when OTT platforms came,

121
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:15,912
they made Big Boss OTT.

122
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:17,262
Big Boss

123
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:21,589
George Orwell mentioned Big Brother as a warning in his book.

124
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,721
He was criticizing governments like Stalin and Hitler

125
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:28,564
and the techniques used in these dictatorships

126
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:30,169
to fool people.

127
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,588
How propaganda for fascism is run on the telescreen.

128
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:35,208
And there is constant surveillance,

129
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,890
no one is safe from it.

130
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,762
History is rewritten.

131
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,700
The people display the bandwagon effect.

132
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,932
Facts are presented in a completely distorted manner.

133
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:48,680
And a cult personality is created around the Supreme Leader.

134
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,976
The political opponents who question this dictatorial government

135
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:55,809
have to deal with conspiracy theories against them.

136
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:58,032
They are declared anti-national.

137
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:00,517
Many famous slogans were given by this book

138
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,510
like "Ignorance is power,

139
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,017
Freedom is slavery,

140
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,226
War is peace."

141
00:05:06,226 --> 00:05:08,302
Even today this novel is very relevant

142
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:11,781
especially when the governments buy software like Pegasus

143
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:13,943
using tax money

144
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:16,809
to surveil people, to snoop.

145
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:18,843
So, this novel is a must-read.

146
00:05:18,843 --> 00:05:21,012
I would definitely recommend you read it.

147
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:22,648
If you don't have time to read the novel,

148
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:23,989
you can go to ChatGPT

149
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:26,741
and ask ChatGPT for a summary.

150
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:27,733
I'll simply need to write,

151
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:32,072
"Explain the novel 1984 by George Orwell 

152
00:05:32,072 --> 00:05:33,606
in ten bullet points,

153
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:35,095
using simple language."

154
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:36,349
And here you can see,

155
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:39,487
I have got a very good summary

156
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:41,871
of the story in this novel.

157
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:45,460
It is about a man named Winston Smith.

158
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,041
If you want to expand on any point,

159
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,111
"Elaborate on point 4

160
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,909
how were historical record changed?"

161
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:55,019
Ask how history was rewritten in the novel.

162
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:58,182
It is written here that if a wrong prediction is made by the party,

163
00:05:58,182 --> 00:06:00,085
people like Winston's were tasked with

164
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:02,954
changing the old news records

165
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:05,954
so that it looks like the party had made the right prediction.

166
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:08,088
With the help of AI tools like ChatGPT,

167
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:11,681
it has become so easy to understand complex ideas.

168
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:15,166
This is why I have made a 4.5-hour long course on this

169
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,389
so that you can master ChatGPT.

170
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:20,406
And you can get a deeper understanding of AI chatbots like this

171
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:21,978
how they work,

172
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:23,465
what are their limitations,

173
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:24,904
what is possible to do with them

174
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:26,851
and how you can use them

175
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:28,747
in your school or college life,

176
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:29,744
in your job,

177
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:31,139
in expanding your business

178
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:31,988

192
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,727
Coming back to the topic,

193
00:07:01,727 --> 00:07:04,294
what are shows like Big Brother and Big Boss doing?

194
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:05,959
Contrary to this novel,

195
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,709
they are providing you the cheapest form of entertainment

196
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:11,254
which has a heavy dose of two things.

197
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:13,583
Everyday sadism and voyeurism.

198
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,904
First, let's look at sadism.

199
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:17,348
The definition of this word is something like this

200
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:19,145
"The tendency to derive pleasure 

201
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:22,281
from inflicting pain, suffering, or humiliation on others."

202
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:26,332
Enjoying hurting others and insulting them.

203
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:28,654
You may find this shocking

204
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:31,219
but if you are a part of the audience watching Big Boss,

205
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:33,652
then you are taking part in this sadistic pleasure too.

206
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:36,902
Normally, a sadistic personality is associated

207
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:38,275
with murderers or psychopaths.

208
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:40,027
Only psychopath people

209
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:43,247
who kill others or hurt others

210
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:45,488
and enjoy it as they derive pleasure in doing so.

211
00:07:45,488 --> 00:07:47,319
But some psychological studies

212
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,002
have discovered a less extreme category of sadism

213
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,556
which is called Everyday Sadism.

214
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:54,582
Like this study from 2013

215
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:56,686
which was published in the reputed journal

216
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:57,745
Psychological Science.

217
00:07:57,745 --> 00:08:00,571
They conducted psychological experiments on Everyday Sadism.

218
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:02,060
Let me give you some examples.

219
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,255
You'd remember that in the ancient Roman Empire

220
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:05,551
as you must have read in your text books

221
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,261
that the Colosseum in Rome

222
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:09,279
was a stadium for public entertainment.

223
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,498
Here, gladiators would often fight each other.

224
00:08:12,498 --> 00:08:15,521
Many times when a gladiator would get badly injured

225
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:18,074
the audience in the stadium would be asked

226
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:21,067
whether to let him go or to kill him.

227
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,271
Many times the people would give a thumbs up

228
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:24,239
to kill him.

229
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,539
Often in this arena,

230
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,141
a hungry animal would be sent,

231
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:28,731
like a tiger or a lion,

232
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:30,370
to fight this gladiator.

233
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,586
This is a good example of Everyday Sadism

234
00:08:32,586 --> 00:08:34,405
because the people sitting in the stadium

235
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:37,745
were looking for entertainment in the suffering of a gladiator.

236
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:40,554
Moving forward thousands of years,

237
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:43,674
today, many people enjoy watching street fights.

238
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:46,032
When two people start fighting on the road,

239
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:46,832
whatever the reason,

240
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:48,259
often a crowd gathers.

241
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:51,133
Very few people try to stop the fight.

242
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:53,253
Most people just stand around

243
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:54,736
and enjoy the fight.

244
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:57,535
Another example of this are the bullies.

245
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:59,859
People who like to bully others

246
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:01,032
in school or college.

247
00:09:01,032 --> 00:09:05,357
People who enjoy humiliating others.

248
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:07,108
Or you would have seen people who

249
00:09:07,108 --> 00:09:13,444
will start kicking or throwing stones at dogs 
on the side of the road for no reason.

250
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:14,903
Just because they enjoy it.

251
00:09:14,903 --> 00:09:17,825
A moderate example of this in an office could be

252
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:21,573
a boss who is always criticising an employee for no reason.

253
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:23,329
Not because he wants to get some work done.

254
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,065
Just because he enjoys

255
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,348
inflicting mental pain on his employees.

256
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:30,592
These are the major examples of Everyday Sadism.

257
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:32,408
Mob lynching is another example.

258
00:09:32,408 --> 00:09:33,806
This year in May,

259
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,837
a Bihar migrant worker

260
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:38,189
was lynched in Kerala by a crowd

261
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:40,273
when accusations were raised that he was a thief.

262
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:42,382
Something similar happened in the Palghar incident

263
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,853
when two sadhus were lynched

264
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:47,537
because of a rumour that they were child kidnappers.

265
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:48,909
It's a different matter that later

266
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:50,201
some biased media anchors

267
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:52,083
put a Hindu-Muslim touch to this

268
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,320
to give it a communal angle.

269
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,362
You will see many examples of Everyday Sadism everywhere.

270
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:59,498
If someone on the street says that

271
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,381
they have caught a pickpocketer,

272
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:03,784
4 people would gather and start beating him.

273
00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:05,809
They justify their actions by saying that

274
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:08,481
they beat him because he was a pickpockter.

275
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,705
But in reality, the reason for such things is

276
00:10:10,705 --> 00:10:13,082
to derive sadistic pleasure

277
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:14,094
by beating someone.

278
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:18,021
You can see this Everyday Sadism in political binaries as well.

279
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:20,413
Like, when journalist Vinod Dua passed away.

280
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:23,352
There was a group of people who were celebrating this.

281
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:26,422
On the other hand, when news anchor Rohit Sardana passed away,

282
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:29,345
There were some people on the other side who were celebrating this.

283
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:32,035
Now, criticizing the work of these people is one thing,

284
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:35,411
but taking a sadistic pleasure in their passing away,

285
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:37,369
finding one's happiness in another's death,

286
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:39,358
is a good example of sadism.

287
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:41,522
People often have many justifications

288
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:43,060
in the name of Everyday Sadism.

289
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,060
Some say that this is the justice of nature,

290
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,397
and some say that this is karma.

291
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:48,105
But actually, all of this is sadism.

292
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,986
People derive sadistic pleasure

293
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:54,081
when they see someone getting insulted or trolled.

294
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:57,319
Entire YouTube channels are often made on this.

295
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:00,148
Where in each and every video, someone gets insulted,

296
00:11:00,148 --> 00:11:02,834
someone gets abused or someone gets bullied.

297
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:05,853
Now, I am not criticizing the roast format here

298
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:08,608
because making roast videos can be an art.

299
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:11,094
It can be done positively

300
00:11:11,094 --> 00:11:12,325
without sadism.

301
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:13,748
A good example of this would be

302
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:15,561
Slaypoint's YouTube channel

303
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,026
which makes roast videos.

304
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:19,186
They criticize stupid things

305
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:21,864
like being an irrational motivational guru

306
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:24,041
or some absurd food recipes.

307
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,882
But they poke fun on the stupidity.

308
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:30,039
They do not intend to abuse, bully, or insult someone.

309
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:33,507
A 2018 study by the University of Innsbruck showed

310
00:11:33,507 --> 00:11:35,629
how everyday sadists

311
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,585
like to play especially violent video games.

312
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:41,150
Because that's what uplifts their mood.

313
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,328
That's what gives them happiness.

314
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:45,622
Often films are made to exploit this sadism.

315
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,570
They are called Torture Films.

316
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,123
Like the Saw series

317
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:50,710
or Human Centipede.

318
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,426
Some people liked Joker's character in the film Dark Knight 

319
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:57,196
because perhaps their own sadistic personality

320
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:58,562
gets validated by that.

321
00:11:58,562 --> 00:12:00,522
But on the other hand, there are some films

322
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:02,134
that I would like to state as examples

323
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:04,969
which sensitively depict sadism.

324
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:07,054
For example, the film The Platform

325
00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:08,238
or Snowpiercer.

326
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:10,879
Criticizing the socio-economic system,

327
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,408
showing violence without glorifying it.

328
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:15,534
And finally, if we come to Bigg Boss,

329
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,445
TV shows like Big Brother and Bigg Boss

330
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,348
exploit this Everyday Sadism.

331
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:22,720
They try to appease this.

332
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,513
Their formula is that people like to watch this nonsense,

333
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:27,281
so they give them nonsense.

334
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,912
And to be honest, this Everyday Sadism in Bigg Boss

335
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:31,647
reaches the next level.

336
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:34,218
Contestants always fight with each other.

337
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:35,929
There are often physical fights.

338
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,862
People throw utensils at each other.

339
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:41,724
In one case, a contestant threw boiling water at another.

340
00:12:41,724 --> 00:12:43,027
There's physical violence.

341
00:12:43,027 --> 00:12:46,362
In one case, a contestant choke-slammed another contestant.

342
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,760
The contestants aren't the only ones to do this,

343
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,493
rather, the concept of the show encourages this.

344
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:05,047
For example, once the contestants were given a torture task

345
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:09,187
in which they had to throw chilli powder on the faces of other contestants.

346
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:20,381
The contestants are made to do such nonsensical 'tasks'

347
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:22,095
so that they can be humiliated.

348
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:24,731
People are asked to bathe in cow dung.

349
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:27,242
A man was asked to drink water from a dog bowl.

350
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:30,266
Often people leak each other's personal matters

351
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:31,822
which makes people cry.

352
00:13:31,822 --> 00:13:33,407
You get to see body shaming.

353
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:36,870
A female contestant tells another female contestant

354
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,801
that some people were not worthy of standing with her.

355
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:41,684
Criticising their physical appearance. 

356
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:45,447
"Backbiting" is a crucial component of this show.

357
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:48,530
You regularly see misogyny and homophobia.

358
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,406
Sometimes someone mixes soap in someone's water.

359
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:54,329
Sometimes a guy breaks the lock of the washroom

360
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:55,877
when a girl is taking a shower.

361
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,787
Often you see toxic relationships.

362
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:03,778
Some of these are fake relationships

363
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:07,044
which are shown just to increase the show's TRP.

364
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:09,495
Then comes the concept of Voyeurism.

365
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:11,236
This word means

366
00:14:11,236 --> 00:14:13,953
taking cheap pleasure in watching other people's lives.

367
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:18,221
Enjoying closely watching what happens in other people's private lives.

368
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:21,549
Once again, you will see many examples of this in your daily life.

369
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:23,625
Like, if there is an MMS leak.

370
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:27,099
You see people searching on Google to find it.

371
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,981
Another example of this could be

372
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:31,545
some people like to watch daily vlogs.

373
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:34,384
There are some YouTubers whose vlogs are aimed at

374
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:36,941
when they woke up, brushed their teeth,

375
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:39,848
played with their dog, rode their bicycle,

376
00:14:39,848 --> 00:14:41,282
and then they went shopping.

377
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:43,313
Why do people find these things entertaining?

378
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:44,595
Because of voyeurism.

379
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:47,571
People enjoy watching what's going on in their personal lives.

380
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:50,947
And it's a shame that some YouTubers even exploit this.

381
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:52,399
Like, their child may be crying,

382
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,664
but they think about getting the camera 
because it will be good content.

383
00:14:54,664 --> 00:14:56,211
Their child might be hurt,

384
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:57,986
but first they take the camera and film it.

385
00:14:57,986 --> 00:14:59,348
If there is a fight at home,

386
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:00,881
they want to be the ones to stream it.

387
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:02,679
So that they get some content.

388
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:06,599
Many people often make a dangerous one-sided parasocial relationship

389
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,925
with daily vloggers.

390
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:11,505
In my opinion, children should not be allowed

391
00:15:11,505 --> 00:15:13,208
to watch daily vlogs.

392
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,408
Since children's brains are not fully developed

393
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:18,964
so voyeurism can be very dangerous for them.

394
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:22,068
Another moderate example of this is CCTV footages.

395
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:24,051
People enjoy watching

396
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:27,128
CCTV footage of thieves being captured

397
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:31,688
or someone being murdered 
or a terrorist attack or road accidents.

398
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:35,159
Media houses also often play these footages on TV.

399
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,914
So Everyday Voyeurism

400
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:39,550
obviously increases in a surveillance state.

401
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,442
So, if we talk about Bigg Boss again,

402
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:45,501
then this Everyday Voyeurism is exploited badly by Bigg Boss.

403
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:49,786
In Bigg Boss 16, 98 cameras were installed inside the house.

404
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:53,290
And now, a different level of madness is taking place regarding voyeurism.

405
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,276
Contestants are often recorded 24x7 with multi-cameras

406
00:15:57,276 --> 00:16:01,564
and the audience is also allowed to watch them 24x7 on a live feed.

407
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:03,322
They can choose any of the three cameras

408
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:05,294
and choose what they want to watch.

409
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:08,213
And as you know, there is so much 
unemployment in the country that

410
00:16:08,213 --> 00:16:10,087
there are a lot of people who are free

411
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:11,601
who have no other work

412
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:13,022
so they start watching this.

413
00:16:13,022 --> 00:16:15,140
By watching the live feed of these cameras

414
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,140
one can take some voyeuristic pleasure.

415
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,138
People often share their personal secrets 
with their close friends and best friends.

416
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:24,262
But here, people are told

417
00:16:24,262 --> 00:16:27,396
to tell their personal secrets on national television.

418
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:29,294
To generate content and TRP.

419
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:30,806
And the amazing thing is that

420
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:34,362
nothing about this 'reality' TV show is real.

421
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:37,909
Contestants know that they are being recorded for 24 hours

422
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,201
with so many cameras.

423
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:40,587
So will any contestant

424
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:42,579
behave in their natural state here?

425
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:44,294
Will your behaviour be the same

426
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,291
as it is normally?

427
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,051
Not at all.

428
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:48,762
Everyone will be self-conscious to some extent.

429
00:16:48,762 --> 00:16:51,967
Secondly, an artificial competitive setup is created in this show

430
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,315
so that you will naturally have to insult others,

431
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,931
and backbite others,

432
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:58,115
if you want to rise above them.

433
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:00,423
In Bigg Boss' house, this is called 'performance.'

434
00:17:00,423 --> 00:17:02,483
These interactions between people,

435
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:04,176
are these natural interactions

436
00:17:04,176 --> 00:17:05,567
that would happen in real life?

437
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:06,936
In real life,

438
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:08,751
if so many people have to live in a house,

439
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:10,787
there will hardly be a fight between them.

440
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:13,141
Here, such setups are forced

441
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:15,040
to create arguments and fights between people.

442
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,494
The truth is, friends,

443
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,920
the world is not that stupid.

444
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,077
Although I have told you many examples of 
Everyday Sadism and Everyday Voyeurism.

445
00:17:22,077 --> 00:17:23,656
But most people are not like that.

446
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:25,915
There are many intellectual, well-behaved,

447
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:28,454
dignified, and compassionate people in the world.

448
00:17:28,454 --> 00:17:31,028
Take Dr Vikas Divyakirti, for example,

449
00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:34,153
He has made many educational videos on philosophical topics.

450
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,211
Or if we talk about actors and actresses,

451
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:37,894
take Konkana Sen, for example,

452
00:17:37,894 --> 00:17:40,455
She has given so many great performances in so many films.

453
00:17:40,455 --> 00:17:42,421
But in the 17 seasons of Bigg Boss,

454
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:47,313
you would not have seen a single person like
Dr Vikas Divyakirti or Konkana Sen.

455
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:51,757
Firstly, nice people will never go to such cheap shows.

456
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:53,137
But secondly,

457
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:55,084
even if a nice person goes to such shows

458
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:57,000
they are provoked

459
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,736
to be part of this sadism and voyeurism.

460
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:02,195
To create controversy and insult people

461
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:04,074
and if they don't, they will be thrown out.

462
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:06,194
There was a participant in Bigg Boss 8

463
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:07,244
Sushant Divgikar.

464
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:09,821
A model, singer, dancer, psychologist,

465
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:12,206
and winner of Mr Gay India 2014.

466
00:18:12,206 --> 00:18:15,153
He was thrown out of Bigg Boss very quickly.

467
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:16,975
Later, he said in an interview that

468
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:19,873
he has more than 500 books at home.

469
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:22,487
he reads a lot, and has an IQ of 147.

470
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:26,133
But he said that he was sad to say that the collective IQ of the Bigg Boss 8 contestants

471
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:27,750
was less than room temperature.

472
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,582
All the while Sushant lived in that house,

473
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:30,772
Sushant didn't fight with anyone

474
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:33,788
he just kept busy with his songs and dance routines.

475
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:35,168
But you don't get TRP like this.

476
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:36,622
You get TRP only when

477
00:18:36,622 --> 00:18:39,366
there's conflict or fights among contestants.

478
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:41,529
Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav

479
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:43,456
was a contestant in Bigg Boss 13.

480
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,104
He was also thrown out of the house very quickly.

481
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:47,490
And when he gave an interview to Times of India,

482
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,504
he said that the format of the show

483
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:50,595
doesn't suit him.

484
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:53,150
Humans become devils in this house.

485
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,737
And if you want to move ahead in this show,

486
00:18:54,737 --> 00:18:57,316
you can do so only by insulting and humiliating others.

487
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:58,408
This was what he said.

488
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:00,304
"I was amid devils there.

489
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:02,305
There, in the form of humans,

490
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:04,198
everyone was behaving like devils.

491
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:06,099
And no one is human in there.

492
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:07,185
What can anyone do?"

493
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:10,298
Bigg Boss Season 4 contestant Rahul Bhatt said in an interview,

494
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:11,895
"I can't provide entertainment

495
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:14,426
to viewers at the cost of making a fool of myself."

496
00:19:14,426 --> 00:19:16,538
Why would the channel want to keep someone on the show

497
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:19,397
if there is no controversy or romance involving them?

498
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,045
So on the face of it, it looks like

499
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:22,556
there is no public voting here.

500
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:25,272
Only the TRP decides who will be thrown out of the house.

501
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:28,509
Bigg Boss Season 9 contestant Aman Verma also said that

502
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:31,275
he had a pre-planned deal with the producers

503
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:33,502
that he will be in the house for only 6 weeks.

504
00:19:33,502 --> 00:19:37,603
A Sunday special episode of Bigg Boss 16 was hosted by Shekhar Suman.

505
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:39,899
He had criticized some of the contestants

506
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:42,972
but the viewers criticized him

507
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,658
for pointing out only some of the contestants.

508
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,403
So he replied by saying that

509
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:48,608
he had been given a script

510
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:50,034
written by the channel

511
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:51,414
that he had to follow.

512
00:19:51,414 --> 00:19:53,352
Bigg Boss 4 winner Shweta Tiwari,

513
00:19:53,352 --> 00:19:56,086
Bigg Boss 6 contestant Aashka Goradia

514
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:58,708
and Bigg Boss 11 runner-up Hina Khan said

515
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,049
that this show is heavily edited.

516
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:02,647
The long conversations

517
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:05,139
are shown as two lines only.

518
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:07,019
It is deliberately shown

519
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:09,443
as if there are misunderstandings between the show's contestants

520
00:20:09,443 --> 00:20:10,773
sheer misrepresentations.

521
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:15,425
Aashka said that she was rubbing a balm 
on another female contestant's hand

522
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:16,800
after she had an allergic reaction.

523
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,616
But the show's editors

524
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:20,192
used editing tricks

525
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:21,559
and showed only half of the things

526
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,015
and made it look like

527
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,840
she was a lesbian.

528
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,781
Bigg Boss 7's contestant Shilpa Saklani says that

529
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:29,346
the show is not scripted,

530
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:32,074
but that everyone knows what to do to win.

531
00:20:32,074 --> 00:20:33,845
There are prerequisites

532
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:35,286
to react and give content,

533
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:36,394
to fight with each other,

534
00:20:36,394 --> 00:20:37,691
to put across their point of view,

535
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:38,804
and to be assertive.

536
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,941
So even if we ignore these accusations

537
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:42,273
of the show being scripted,

538
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:44,052
even if we believe that the show is not scripted,

539
00:20:44,052 --> 00:20:45,572
some things are very clear in front of us.

540
00:20:45,572 --> 00:20:47,630
First, there are no auditions here.

541
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,821
Contestants are chosen by the makers of the show.

542
00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:51,729
Based on what?

543
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:54,035
Well, it seems like, based on intrigue. 

544
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:58,445
Second, 24-hour footage is edited to be a 50-minute episode.

545
00:20:58,445 --> 00:21:00,497
Which of those 50 minutes are shown?

546
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:02,295
Those that will attract the most viewers.

547
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:05,895
Third, the viewer's perception based on that edit,

548
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:07,604
influences the voting.

549
00:21:07,604 --> 00:21:09,354
Often the rules are also bent.

550
00:21:09,354 --> 00:21:12,013
Sometimes there are no eliminations on some weekends.

551
00:21:12,013 --> 00:21:14,575
Sometimes the contestants who have been eliminated

552
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:16,117
are called back into the house

553
00:21:16,117 --> 00:21:18,884
and sometimes, there is a wild-card entrant.

554
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:21,269
Everything is decided by the makers of the show

555
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:22,701
based on its saleability.

556
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:24,652
Fourth, the tasks given in the show

557
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:26,795
are also decided by the makers of the show

558
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:28,116
based on saleability.

559
00:21:28,116 --> 00:21:29,780
And what is saleable here?

560
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,727
No intellectual discussion.

561
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,906
No social issues, philosophy, history,

562
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:35,911
sociology, spirituality,

563
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:37,985
poetry, literature, cinema, or science.

564
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:39,383
None of it is being discussed here.

565
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:42,073
People just want to watch others fighting.

566
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:44,080
People want to see their personal lives.

567
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,556
People want to see people backbiting others.

568
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:47,587
People want to see other people insulting each other.

569
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:51,661
A cocktail of Everyday Sadism and Voyeurism.

570
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:53,418
Whose show is it? 
The show makers'.

571
00:21:53,418 --> 00:21:55,410
Who's money is invested? 
The show makers'.

572
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,488
Who's time is being wasted? 
Yours!

573
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:59,124
And whose mental state is being affected?

574
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:00,000
Yours!

575
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,071
When Honey Singh is asked about his misogynist songs,

576
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,669
he replies that it's just entertainment.

577
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:07,274
That it is what the public wants.

578
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:09,774
If you ask the showmakers of Bigg Boss

579
00:22:09,774 --> 00:22:11,194
about what they are showing to the public,

580
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:12,694
he will also reply similarly.

581
00:22:12,694 --> 00:22:14,208
The same excuse is used

582
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,413
that it's just entertainment.

583
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:17,521
The public wants this, 
that's why they show it.

584
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:21,023
"Entertainment. Entertainment. Entertainment."

585
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:25,005
Friends, the thing is, watching such things can affect you too.

586
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:27,757
Psychiatrist Dr Marcia Sirota claims that

587
00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:31,700
just like our teeth and health are affected by junk food,

588
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,086
bad reality TV shows

589
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,724
affects our brains

590
00:22:35,724 --> 00:22:37,863
and we become ruder.

591
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:40,226
When people see the reality TV shows

592
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:43,420
and how celebrities become rich and famous on it

593
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,883
by abusing people,

594
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:46,452
doing weird things,

595
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,789
and by becoming self-serving egoistics,

596
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:51,114
the audience is convinced by this perception.

597
00:22:51,114 --> 00:22:55,069
The audience starts believing that if they want to earn money and fame,

598
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:56,493
then this is the best way.

599
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:57,913
Doing such cheap things.

600
00:22:57,913 --> 00:23:00,634
Telecasting their personal life on national TV.

601
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:03,686
Insulting, bullying, and roasting other people.

602
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:07,299
Brian Gibson, a psychologist at Central Michigan University,

603
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:09,530
did a study and concluded that

604
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,437
watching such reality TV shows,

605
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:13,310
leads to an increase in aggression in the viewers.

606
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,768
Comparing to violent media and crime TV shows,

607
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:19,489
reality TV shows cause a higher increase than them.

608
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:22,372
An effect on the mental health of the contestants is also evident.

609
00:23:22,372 --> 00:23:24,409
Many contestants have said that

610
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:27,442
after the show, they had to deal with so many mental health issues.

611
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:30,742
Many contestants who were so determined to win

612
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,571
that they reveal their personal secrets

613
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:33,827
later regretted doing so.

614
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:37,369
Some contestants are made into villains in the public perception,

615
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:40,249
even though they are not that bad in real life.

616
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:43,566
Then the public criticism that people have to face after coming on the show,

617
00:23:43,566 --> 00:23:47,242
that causes a lot of anxiety among the contestants.

618
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:49,515
Shamita Shetty, Sana Khan, Kushal Tandon,

619
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:52,288
Nikki Tamboli, Kavita Kaushik, Shalin Bhanot,

620
00:23:52,288 --> 00:23:54,004
Rahul Vaidya, Himanshi Khurana,

621
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:56,330
Apurva Agnihotri, and Shilpa Shaklani,

622
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,971
are the examples of those people

623
00:23:57,971 --> 00:24:00,568
who faced mental health issues after going on the show

624
00:24:00,568 --> 00:24:03,133
and after the show, they had to take therapy.

625
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:04,951
So I request everyone

626
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:07,614
to not treat their brain like a dustbin.

627
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,176
Your brain is not a dustbin

628
00:24:09,176 --> 00:24:10,569
that you can keep throwing any rubbish into it.

629
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:12,480
The content you are consuming,

630
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,294
choose it wisely.

631
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:16,647
The type of entertainment you are consuming,

632
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:19,596
think about what effect it is having on you.

633
00:24:19,596 --> 00:24:23,621
Does it have a positive impact on your life or a negative impact?

634
00:24:23,621 --> 00:24:27,920
And I am not saying that you should always consume intellectual content.

635
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,814
Even if you want to consume non-intellectual entertainment,

636
00:24:30,814 --> 00:24:32,356
think about it first.

637
00:24:32,356 --> 00:24:34,407
Will it have a positive or negative impact on you?

638
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:37,051
And obviously, if you spend your time learning new things,

639
00:24:37,051 --> 00:24:39,139
it will have a very positive impact.

640
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:41,543
