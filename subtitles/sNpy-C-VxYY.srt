1
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,625
'Some characters
are written with blood.'

2
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:19,291
'Some characters are written
in tears.'

3
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:23,250
'This is the story that is
written in both blood and tears.'

4
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,916
'The story of blood and tears.'

5
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,291
- Sir.
- Good morning, Sir.

6
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,000
'I have been called to Delhi
for an emergency.'

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,250
Okay, sir.

8
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,208
- Can you hurry up, please?
- Sure, Sir.

9
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,750
- Thank you.
- Sir.

10
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,208
[phone ringing]

11
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,208
[phone ringing]

12
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,666
'Mr. Vikram, Code Red.'

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,250
'Get here immediately.'

14
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:03,875
Coming, sir.

15
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,666
Rajput sir called.

16
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,250
He says it's a Red Code.

17
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,583
It's freezing here in Delhi.

18
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,083
Yeah, it's so cold.

19
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,416
- Taxi!
- Sir!

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,625
Sir, ID, please.

21
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,666
All okay, Sir.
They are waiting for you.

22
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,833
- Thank you.
- Come quickly.

23
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,041
This way, please.

24
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,166
Thank you.

25
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,041
Gentlemen,
this is Viswanath Sastry...

26
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,166
DSP - Crime Branch, Guntur.

27
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,291
And this is Mr Anuj Gupta,
In charge of VIP security, Delhi.

28
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:39,833
Sir.

29
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,541
Mr Singh,
Commissioner of Police, Delhi.

30
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:43,916
Sir.

31
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,666
This is Mr Vikram Choudhary...

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,500
In charge, of personal security
to the Prime Minister of India.

33
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm Raghavendra Rajput,
Chief of Intelligence Bureau.

34
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,208
Sir, may I ask
what this is all about?

35
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,666
You called at midnight
and called me to Delhi.

36
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,583
What's the emergency, Sir?

37
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,583
Mr Viswanath Sastry,
IPS 1963 batch.

38
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,291
First posting, Bapatla division.

39
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,666
Second posting, Chirala division.

40
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,208
Third posting, 1979 till date...

41
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,291
DSP - Crime Branch, Guntur.

42
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:18,375
So primarily...
you worked in the tiger zone.

43
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,333
The zone of...

44
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,333
Tiger Nageswara Rao.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,750
Sir, I'm sorry I don't get it.

46
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,208
What does PM's security have
to do with Tiger Nageswara Rao?

47
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,750
Mr Sastry...

48
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,500
In this meeting,
I'll be asking the questions.

49
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,875
Please sit down.

50
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,958
Now tell me everything
about Tiger Nageswara Rao.

51
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,500
Sir.

52
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,458
Sir, if Nageswara Rao
entered politics,

53
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,083
he would have won every election.

54
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,458
He would have bagged a medal
for India if he were into sports.

55
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,083
If he were in the army, no one would
have dared to challenge our borders.

56
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,708
But unfortunately,
he chose to be a criminal.

57
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,708
I have seen many people
like him in my service.

58
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,708
Mangal Singh,
Omkar Singh Yadav, Piyula.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,875
[scoffs]

60
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,583
Is he a bigger robber than them?

61
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,208
Sir, thieves attack
without intimation.

62
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,000
Robbers attack suddenly and rob.

63
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:42,125
But if someone challenges and then
comes, that's Tiger Nageswara Rao.

64
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,208
Sir, whoever saw Nageswara Rao
was either killed

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,458
or remained silent in fear of him.

66
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,750
In fact, even I, too, never saw him.

67
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,583
Some years ago, when I was posted

68
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,833
at Chirala police station
on special duty...

69
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,291
I received a phone call.

70
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,083
I still remember that voice, sir.

71
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,708
That was more like a roar.

72
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,958
[phone ringing]

73
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,583
- Chirala police station.
- 'Remember this voice.'

74
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:22,083
You must have seen a tiger
that hunts deer,

75
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:26,291
but I am a tiger that hunts tigers.

76
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,458
Who is it?

77
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,000
An appeal to the cops...

78
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,583
The Circar Express
bearing number 17643,

79
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,250
running from Kakinada to Madras...

80
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,833
is about to be looted en-route.

81
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,958
20 tons of grain was being sent

82
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,333
from Kakinada to Madras
for storm victims.

83
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,958
And someone called
and threatened to rob it.

84
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,958
Who gave you that information?

85
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,083
Stuartpuram Nageswara Rao.

86
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:03,500
We are fond of declaring war
before starting it.

87
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,833
Um...

88
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,000
- Call the Control room!
- Okay, Sir.

89
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,208
There is a distance of 242 km
between Kakinada and Madras.

90
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,333
21 stations fall en-route, and there
are ten policemen at each station.

91
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,833
There was an RPF personnel
in each coach.

92
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,875
There was only one chance
of robbing the train.

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,708
The Godavari Bridge, which runs
over a length of 2300 metres.

94
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,958
Amid such tight security...

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,708
To rob 20 tonnes of grain. That,
too, in four and a half minutes.

96
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,333
Do you really think it's possible, sir?

97
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,583
It takes five hours to load it.

98
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,458
Robbing 20 tonnes in
four and a half minutes?

99
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,833
It's impossible.

100
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,375
Sir...

101
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:53,000
The job which you think is
impossible, he can do it easily.

102
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:56,375
[train honking]

103
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,958
[train honking]

104
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,333
[train honking]

105
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:22,250
Tiger starts thinking at the point
where the common man stops thinking.

106
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,666
[train honking]

107
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,000
[whistling]

108
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,208
Come on, hurry up!

109
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,333
[train honking]

110
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,916
The bridge is about to end.
Get out, all of you!

111
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,666
Hey! Turn around quickly!

112
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:52,166
- Come on, quickly!
- Turn it! Come on, turn! Hurry up!

113
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,416
Remove it, hurry up!

114
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,833
No!

115
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,208
Nagi, jump!

116
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,708
No!

117
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,541
Did you get him?

118
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,583
- Come on, move!
- Look over there.

119
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,875
- Over here.
- Look over there.

120
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,666
- Come on, hurry up!
- There is nothing here.

121
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,000
- Hello!
- 'Sir, he is not here.'

122
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,500
He wouldn't have gone far...

123
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,875
How will we get him?
We've never even seen him.

124
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,750
In olden times, just as
kings used to enter a kingdom

125
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,375
and take away things,
considering them as their reward,

126
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,416
Nageswara Rao's
thinking is also similar.

127
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,916
He doesn't consider
these things as theft.

128
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,666
He considers them as rewards.

129
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,958
Sir, we got all the crime files
on Nageswara Rao ready.

130
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,291
Has he written so much crime
literature in a span of 25 years?

131
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,416
He started very early, sir.

132
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,416
Like when he was ten?

133
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,083
- No, eight years.
- Robbery at the age of eight?

134
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,291
It was a murder.

135
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,833
No, sir! Don't do this.
This is wrong.

136
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,666
I didn't do anything. Leave me.

137
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:57,791
- Yelamanda.
- Sir!

138
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,166
He was the linchpin
of Stuartpuram's crimes.

139
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,791
Every crime that happens in
Stuartpuram is on his instructions.

140
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,458
He always has a share
that comes out of that crime.

141
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,666
Hey, Sir is here.

142
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,291
Hey, stop. Stop doing it.

143
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:13,416
Can't you see Sir is here?

144
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,458
How dare you steal without

145
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:23,583
my permission! What did you think
that you would take it all alone?

146
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,833
I break into pieces, anyone
who doesn't give me my share.

147
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,208
That's the money I robbed
through effort and risk.

148
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,083
I only have the right to it.

149
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,625
Does the ox own the crop
just because it ploughs the land?

150
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,125
Does a dog own the house
just because it stands guard to it?

151
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,958
How can you claim
the money to be yours

152
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,500
when I hold the
rights on Stuartpuram?

153
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
[blowing]

154
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,833
Nail his knees.

155
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,458
No!

156
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,083
Don't do it!

157
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,333
Damaging the knee joints of a thief

158
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,666
is akin to slicing
fingers of a guitarist.

159
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:15,958
Greetings, sir.

160
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,000
Hey...

161
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,583
- Is he your younger son?
- Yes, sir.

162
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,500
Do you want to sit on my chair?

163
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,500
Get hold of him.
Don't let him out of your hands.

164
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,083
Why did you call me?

165
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:39,000
You know Kanaka Rao? He went
to the city and made a fortune.

166
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,458
All the money is
lying in his bungalow.

167
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,208
I'll steal it, sir.

168
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,125
- Listen!
- Sir.

169
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,333
Give him thirty rupees for this.

170
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,958
Sir, please give me two rupees more.

171
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,791
Did your mother store
her fortune with me?

172
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:04,541
Don't take me wrong,
but Manoj was also caught stealing,

173
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,666
and people beat him so
much that he broke his leg.

174
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,416
He is unable to walk anymore.

175
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,666
- Think about his children, Sir.
- [lady]: Hey, Dayavan!

176
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,208
We are not responsible
for his children.

177
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,791
If they want bread to eat,
tell his wife to sell her body.

178
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,291
Or poison them all.

179
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,666
Just think about
the job given to you. Go!

180
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,625
It is a bad omen for theft tonight.

181
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,083
Yelamanda has ordered
this job to be done today itself.

182
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,125
Come.

183
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,000
Why are you digging here, Father?

184
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:21,250
Because there is a rat hole here.
A rat digs precisely

185
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,500
where the wall is vulnerable.
Got it?

186
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:12,500
Hurry up, son. Get out quickly.
Here, grab this.

187
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,208
Stop!

188
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,750
Nagi, someone is pulling me inside.

189
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,083
Pull me out. Come on!

190
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,583
Hey, the thief is escaping!
Come over here!

191
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,666
- Come on!
- Wake Sir up!

192
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,583
- Come!
- Hurry up!

193
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,416
- Come! Catch him!
- Pull him inside.

194
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,583
Guys, there is no
chance I can escape now.

195
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,416
Take this sack
and give it to Yelamanda.

196
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,333
He'll give you three rupees.

197
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,458
Give one rupee to Kalua
and keep the rest.

198
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:50,291
We toiled for this money.
I won't give it to anyone.

199
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,250
Don't leave him.
Catch him!

200
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,958
Don't be stubborn. I've been caught,
and the police will reach you soon.

201
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:00,000
- Go now!
- Quickly, climb the wall! He must have colleagues on that side.

202
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Father, they won't find us,
If they don't recognise you at all.

203
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,791
How can they not recognise me?

204
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:10,375
How can they recognise
a headless body, Father?

205
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,541
[screams]

206
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,166
Animals like lions and tigers
also drink milk in childhood, Sir.

207
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,666
But he started hunting
in his childhood.

208
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,791
By the time the food fed
by his father reached his throat...

209
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,916
he slit his father's throat!

210
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,041
Is he even human?

211
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,041
In order to understand
Nageswara Rao,

212
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,916
you need to know
about Stuartpuram, sir.

213
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,250
Their profession was hunting.

214
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,708
But gradually, they started hunting
travellers along with animals.

215
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,333
They would pounce like
a wolf on those passing

216
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,208
through the forest and
rob them of everything.

217
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,541
Just as prey cannot escape
from the claws of a lion,

218
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,833
no one can escape
from their clutches.

219
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,000
An English officer
named Stuart built a colony

220
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,875
for them to remove
them from the forest.

221
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,000
It was named Stuartpuram.

222
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,125
He thought they would live a
decent life by leaving the forest,

223
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,625
but cruelty had settled
in their nature.

224
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,375
So they started looting
and killing again.

225
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,000
Bijli Prasad... the Dronacharya of
the Kurukshetra called Stuartpuram.

226
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,041
All the gangsters currently
ruling Stuartpuram...

227
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,791
were trained by Prasad in the past.

228
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,208
Hey!

229
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,833
Eating pork curry and
rolling isn't enough.

230
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,125
You must drink donkey
blood and run like a horse.

231
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,000
No cop will be able to catch you.

232
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,541
Ten rupees.

233
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:48,833
Who wants it?

234
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,666
[all]: I want it! I want it!

235
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,625
- Do you want it?
- Yes, sir.

236
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:56,666
Take it.

237
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,333
There is a scorpion inside,
along with the note.

238
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:09,166
Nageswara Rao came under
Bijli Prasad's wing when he was 14.

239
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:12,833
Courage alone isn't
enough for stealing.

240
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,666
Sometimes, you need intelligence.
Because intelligence...

241
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,375
He is Venkat's son.

242
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,583
He is a strong boy. Do you
want to learn the skill from me?

243
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,583
I will rule the whole world.

244
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:37,125
If one drinks donkey blood,

245
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,125
one has to run for some
hours without resting.

246
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,750
Otherwise, the blood in one's body

247
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,125
would clot and
eventually, death happens.

248
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,375
Bijli Prasad mentored Nageswara
Rao under such rigorous training.

249
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,625
Tiger Nageswara Rao.

250
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:56,583
'Tiger Nageswara Rao.'

251
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:16,625
Before any gang
in Stuartpuram could steal,

252
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,333
they had to win the area
in an auction.

253
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,750
Under the watch of Yelamanda.

254
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:25,000
In those days, three major
gangs operated in Stuartpuram.

255
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,583
Pawan Suri, Doga Raj
and George Babu.

256
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,750
Yelamanda entered
politics and became

257
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:34,083
an MLA with money
from Stuartpuram's crime.

258
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,375
And his right hand is his
younger brother Kashi.

259
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:42,083
While Yelamanda was
running politics from Hyderabad,

260
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,875
his brother took care of the
matters of Stuartpuram.

261
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,625
Hey!

262
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,208
Start the auction.

263
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:57,083
Guntur railway station...
The opening bid is 25000 rupees.

264
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,625
- 30000 rupees.
- 35000 rupees.

265
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,041
That's it? Brother is an MLA now.

266
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,291
All the cops are in our reach now.

267
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:12,041
You can rob like a king.
Call higher!

268
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,666
- 50000 rupees.
- Yeah! That's like it!

269
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:19,041
Would anyone like
to bid more than that?

270
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,083
First call!

271
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,666
Second call!

272
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,291
Third and final call!

273
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,458
Sold!

274
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:46,416
Guntur Railway Station is sold
to George Babu for a year.

275
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:49,041
If any other gang member
steals even a penny

276
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,708
from there, his family
will be wiped out.

277
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:56,291
Where have you been?
Let me give you a tour of heaven.

278
00:24:56,291 --> 00:25:00,583
Once I taste something,
I lose interest in it.

279
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:06,166
Vijayawada and Guntur's
opening bid is... One lakh rupees.

280
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:08,500
Young man, can I bid too?

281
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:13,750
You need a gang to steal
and a chair to bid.

282
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,416
Who the hell is he?

283
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:38,666
He is Angee Seth.

284
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:43,916
He smuggles gold in
tobacco boxes, but last week,

285
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,416
customs seized his goods
at the Bandar Port.

286
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:49,666
He has come to seek help
from Yelamanda to get it back.

287
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:55,291
- Bro... - I told you
we can't take up your work.

288
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:56,541
Didn't you get it?

289
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:58,083
Listen to what I have to say.

290
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:02,291
Listen, this job is not
for anyone here.

291
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:04,166
Our business is different.

292
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:08,458
Listen, Pal! My goods are stuck.
If this were my Kolkata,

293
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,666
I would have got the goods
taken out within an hour.

294
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:16,833
But Bandar port is your area.

295
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:18,416
Which is why
I'm asking you for help.

296
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,791
I will give a share
of twenty per cent

297
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:22,833
to the one who will
get my cargo out.

298
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,166
Hey! I told you it won't be done.
Leave!

299
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:27,208
Thirty per cent!

300
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:30,458
Hey, Pal... forty.

301
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:32,916
Forty per cent!

302
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,291
I want fifty!

303
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:42,666
Here comes the tiger.

304
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,791
Give me half the share,
and I'll retrieve your cargo.

305
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:07,833
Will you?

306
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:08,916
Hey!

307
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,541
Decisions around here
are made by Brother.

308
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,583
Who are you to make decisions?
Are you trying to act smart with us?

309
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:19,166
That Cargo is yours.
You will have to take the decision.

310
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:20,666
Deal?

311
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,541
- You bloody...
- Wait, Kashi...

312
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:27,541
He claims to complete this task,
something no one here can do!

313
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:31,291
You all will see
what I do by tomorrow evening.

314
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:36,416
Okay. But be ready to drink
my pee if you don't get the cargo.

315
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:40,791
I will.

316
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:46,208
Oh, man! Would you need a glass,
or would you drink directly?

317
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,666
See you tomorrow.

318
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,166
Sir...

319
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:04,666
You told me the
punishment in case I lose.

320
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:07,416
But you didn't tell me about
the reward in case I win!

321
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:08,791
What do you want?

322
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,416
The chair, sir.

323
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:11,708
What?

324
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,166
If I get the stack,
add another chair

325
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:16,291
to the three that are present here.

326
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18,541
And one of them should be mine.

327
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,333
Let us meet tomorrow evening.

328
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:28,458
There are customs people everywhere.

329
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:31,625
It is pretty risky to go inside.
How will we find gold

330
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,666
in so many tobacco boxes?

331
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:38,916
Do you know how it feels
to smoke a ton of tobacco?

332
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:42,166
Bro, don't tell me that
you want to burn all the cargo!

333
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:03,583
How can a rat do what an
elephant and a lion cannot do?

334
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:05,291
Nageswara Rao is here!

335
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:22,875
All the goods are on fire.
Let the fire brigade come in.

336
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:59,583
Box number 6943 contains my goods.

337
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,708
Miraculous job, Bro.
Hats off to you!

338
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:29,083
Let us take him to
Kolkata, along with us, sir.

339
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:33,208
He is not a normal guy but a spark

340
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,333
that will one day become
a fire and burn everyone.

341
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,083
Are you crazy?

342
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:44,083
If he even sets foot in Kolkata,
we will have to leave our business.

343
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,250
Let's go.

344
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:51,708
Brother! If you ever need help,
remember the name, Angee Seth.

345
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:56,750
Kashi!

346
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,208
Bring the chair.

347
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,375
'Do you want to sit on my chair?'

348
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:27,958
'Did your mother store
her fortune with me?'

349
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:35,666
- Nagi!
- Nagi!

350
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:37,541
- Nagi!
- Nagi!

351
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:42,083
From that day, a new force
was born in Stuartpuram.

352
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:47,625
Nageswara Rao eliminated all the
gangs from Stuartpuram one by one.

353
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:52,833
People's souls trembled
upon hearing his name.

354
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,041
How can he enter my area?

355
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:02,875
He's not even afraid
of your name, sir.

356
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,791
Anyone who raises
their voice is cut off.

357
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:20,708
We have come to you with great hope.
Only you can solve our problem.

358
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,333
We, goldsmiths, get threats
every day. Where should we go?

359
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,333
We shall guarantee your safety.

360
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:29,875
You have to pay us a tax
of 2000 rupees per month.

361
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,750
Otherwise, Nageswara Rao
will cut you off!

362
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:47,958
To eliminate Nageswara Rao, someone
more dangerous than him is needed.

363
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:53,458
And that was Circle Inspector Mauli
of Stuartpuram.

364
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,708
Your Honour, not one
but three people have

365
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,333
lost their lives
in Inspector Mauli's custody.

366
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,958
It takes the law into its own hands.

367
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:04,083
This is the postmortem report
of the boy who died in his custody.

368
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,208
Look how brutally he was beaten.

369
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,583
- I object, Your Honour.
- Have some shame.

370
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,833
This beast has murdered
three people in his custody.

371
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:16,583
You are rooting for this man
who is mentally ill!

372
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,208
He should get himself treated.

373
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,083
The one who died was a criminal,
that's why I am leaving him.

374
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,458
He will remain suspended
as long as the case is ongoing.

375
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,833
I did not steal anything, Sir.
I'm telling the truth, Sir.

376
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:27,583
Hey, how dare you raise
your voice in front of him!

377
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:29,250
- I'll treat you a lesson.
- No, sir!

378
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,000
- Please forgive me, sir!
- You want to steal, huh?

379
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,083
- Sir, it hurts!
- There you go!

380
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:35,125
- Take this!
- Sir, no, please!

381
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:36,625
- Will you raise your voice?
- Please leave me, Sir.

382
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:38,833
- Will you open your mouth now?
- No, Sir!

383
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:43,083
Hey! Did he faint?

384
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,583
Sir, he is dead!

385
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:48,916
You killed a boy in your custody!

386
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:51,416
Mr Ramamurthy,
when is the next hearing?

387
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:53,541
Next week, Sir.

388
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:57,083
- Huh?
- Next week, Sir.

389
00:33:57,166 --> 00:34:00,291
It's okay, sir. You can talk loudly.

390
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:04,458
- You'll have to pay a fine
of Rs 250. - A fine, is it?

391
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:07,166
Stop.

392
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,500
So, how are you?

393
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:17,625
He is running faster than a leopard.

394
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:19,166
Give him some sense.

395
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,750
Yelamanda and his men
want to kill him.

396
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:22,875
- You know that?
- Hey.

397
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,500
- Cool down.
- Here, sign here.

398
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:26,666
Garika Diwakar!

399
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,250
Garika Diwakar!

400
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:30,125
- The Judge is calling, come.
- Garika Diwakar!

401
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:32,000
I'll be back.

402
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:35,125
Lawyer sir!

403
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:38,500
Listen!

404
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:39,791
Why have you stopped, Pal?

405
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,625
The vein of my love is fluttering.

406
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,625
Oh, damn! Not again. You just
had fun in that village, didn't you?

407
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,125
You will never change!

408
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
It’s been a while, let’s go? 

409
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:58,500
Don’t you dare touch me next time, pls leave! 

410
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:01,500
Oh, is it? 

411
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:03,125
How dare you?

412
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,833
i killed you

413
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,458
Well done, Nagi!
This briber is worth it.

414
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,500
Hey, keep quiet!

415
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,083
Hey, bro! What are you doing, bro!

416
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:45,458
Hey, bro! Leave him!

417
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:50,208
Let him go. He's a policeman!
Let him go.

418
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,791
Let's go from here!

419
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,833
There's no one
in the landlord's mansion.

420
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:01,583
Everyone has gone to the city.

421
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:04,625
It's a good opportunity to steal.

422
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:10,000
There is nothing to steal there.
Rusted utensils and broken items.

423
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,333
Stingy landlord!

424
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:13,333
Try to make a big deal sometimes.

425
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:16,583
Only when you aim at the hawk
will you hit the hen.

426
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:20,166
What are you thinking?

427
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,458
Enough of these small heists.

428
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,208
We must get out of here
if we want to pull off a big heist.

429
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,583
Broaden your horizons.

430
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,083
I met someone in the prison.

431
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,375
Have you heard of Madras Port?

432
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:39,000
Gold is smuggled
from Burma to Madras every month.

433
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,125
How much of it?
Could it be 50 tolas?

434
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:43,625
Oh! We will win the lottery.

435
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:48,750
300 kilos.

436
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,958
[coughing]

437
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:53,708
The shipping of Madras Port
is taken care of by Basant Rao.

438
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:59,458
It is difficult even to breathe,
let alone steal under his watch.

439
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,625
He pays attention everywhere.

440
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:04,333
He has 300 men around him.

441
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:08,166
He is that crocodile of the sea
whom no one dares to collide.

442
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:12,833
Officer Sharma had come here to
raid and has been missing for three days.

443
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:16,250
We're here with a search warrant.

444
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,583
Do you know what he does
to his enemies?

445
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:23,208
He cuts them into pieces
and feeds them to the fish.

446
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,833
That looks like Mr Sharma's ring.

447
00:38:27,125 --> 00:38:28,125
Hey!

448
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:29,750
Who chopped Sharma into pieces?

449
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:32,625
He didn't even notice
the gold on the finger.

450
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,375
Goddess Lakshmi will get angry.

451
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,458
Remember...

452
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:44,583
To win a big war, along with
bravery, weapons are also needed.

453
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:46,083
We need guns.

454
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:51,750
Nageswara Rao was the one
who stole out of Stuartpuram

455
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:56,250
and used a gun for the first time
instead of a knife.

456
00:38:56,333 --> 00:39:00,375
He was so clever that he did the
gun transaction on the train itself.

457
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:03,083
And that journey
changed his life forever.

458
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,125
This one is locally made.

459
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:07,833
This can be loaded
once to fire two rounds.

460
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:10,625
This is a pistol.

461
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:12,333
This has six bullets.

462
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,416
It is easy to both keep and use.

463
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,333
- I need five more of these.
- Move,

464
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,208
- let me go.
- Please wait, Ma'am.

465
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:24,750
Why should I wait?

466
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,375
It looks like Ma'am is having
trouble stopping herself.

467
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,500
Who the hell are you to stop me?

468
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:33,000
What's going on there
will make you scream.

469
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:34,708
Uh...

470
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,333
[shot fired]

471
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:05,666
- Isn't the chick rocking, pal?
- Be respectful.

472
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,583
Isn't the respectable
chick rocking?

473
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:09,708
She is your sister-in-law.

474
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:10,666
What?

475
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:17,125
Hey, pull the brakes! Do you even
know how to talk to decent girls?

476
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:25,208
Talk about love and feelings.
Then she will fall in love with you.

477
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:29,833
You are gorgeous.

478
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:31,750
What?

479
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:41,541
I said you are gorgeous,
and I'm in love with you.

480
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:46,791
If you pull the chain, there is a
temple six kilometres from here.

481
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:49,916
Let's go there and get married!

482
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,708
- Are you crazy?
- Yes, I am.

483
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:54,291
But seeing you
brought me to my senses.

484
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,541
I never had the habit
of asking permission.

485
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:59,291
For the first time in my life,
I'm asking for permission.

486
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,291
Marry me, will you?

487
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:06,291
What is this nonsense? Who are you?

488
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:08,958
I'm Nageswara Rao.

489
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:10,916
Stuartpuram Nageswara Rao.

490
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:13,666
Nowadays, boys have
only one or two degrees,

491
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:16,291
but I'm wanted for
more than 150 cases.

492
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:19,333
I have committed
countless murders and thefts.

493
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,125
Can I show you by robbing
this train if you don't believe me?

494
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:31,291
The moment I see a woman,
I feel hunger of a different kind.

495
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:35,458
But for the first time,
the hunger is up here.

496
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:39,333
Hey, don't you know
how to speak to a girl?

497
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:46,291
Babe, it won't take me much time
to woo you with sweet talks.

498
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:50,166
Girls everywhere are really into me,
but my heart has fallen for you.

499
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:53,333
Nowadays, boys want only one thing,

500
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:57,666
but they get their way by talking
about love and affection.

501
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,041
Do you want someone
with a pure heart

502
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,958
or someone who gives fake respect?

503
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:03,666
He nailed it, man!

504
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:13,750
You guys are just students.

505
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:16,875
How do you plan to arrange the
capital for setting up a factory?

506
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:19,000
We'll take care of the funding, sir.

507
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:21,375
But please see that we get
the approval for the factory.

508
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:23,666
Okay. I'll forward the application.

509
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,791
Let us see.

510
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:28,125
[all]: Thank you, sir.

511
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,625
Chirala college.

512
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,375
Nagi gave pocket money
to the boys there,

513
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,625
solved their internal feuds

514
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:37,375
and strengthened his hold
on the students.

515
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:42,125
Here. You also have it.

516
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:49,750
She was not there
when I looked there.

517
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,125
Then they were acting so smart...

518
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,791
- Greetings, Bro!
- Greetings!

519
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,541
Hey, do you know that girl?

520
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,041
She is Sara from BA 2nd year.
She is a Manara's classmate.

521
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,375
- Oh! - Earlier, she used to study
in the neighbouring college,

522
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,500
but after her wedding was
cancelled, she changed her college.

523
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:10,000
She continued her education
because her wedding was cancelled.

524
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:11,500
How did you find out?

525
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:14,041
Because the person who broke
her marriage is sitting right here.

526
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,625
Are you crazy? You want to destroy

527
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,041
her life before she gets settled!

528
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,875
I will have to destroy it
to establish my life.

529
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,875
- It's time for the nuptial rounds.
- Bring the dowry money. - Okay.

530
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:48,625
Hey, the bag is empty!
There is no money in it.

531
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,250
Is this some joke, sir?

532
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:54,000
- Please calm down.
- This wedding is called off.

533
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:56,500
- Please don't do that. - We don't
want a daughter of cheaters.

534
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:57,541
Let's go!

535
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,791
Nagi, you're so mean!

536
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:11,041
Nagi, if she suspects that
you broke her marriage,

537
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:12,500
she would hate you forever.

538
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:28,500
What is this?

539
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,375
The dowry money that went missing
from the bag on the wedding day.

540
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:33,000
- Hey, what is he...
- This is it.

541
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:35,291
How did this reach you?

542
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:38,125
I stole it to stop your wedding.

543
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:01,708
- Let go of me!
- What is he doing?

544
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,458
If he had said he doesn't
care about the dowry

545
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,083
and only wants to marry you...

546
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:10,166
I would have bowed down
before him and doubled the money.

547
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,666
I could have become
a hero by lending

548
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,666
a shoulder at this critical
time if I had wanted.

549
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:17,583
But I don't want a relationship
based on lies.

550
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:29,000
Do you want a dishonest person
who lives on dowry money

551
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,541
or an honest person
who returns stolen money?

552
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:34,416
There... he nailed it!

553
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:43,791
We gave you gold
worth Rs 10 lakh to sell,

554
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:46,208
but you are giving us
only Rs 3 lakh.

555
00:45:46,666 --> 00:45:49,666
Sir, I went to Mumbai only to sell
gold worth Rs 10 lakh to Mr Hassan.

556
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:52,333
But the police raided
and caught everyone.

557
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,541
I saved my life
by giving them one lakh.

558
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:58,041
I swear, please grant me some time,

559
00:45:58,166 --> 00:46:00,458
and I will repay
your money, brother.

560
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:03,833
Mr Kashi... Mr Kashi... Sir.

561
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:07,208
I swear I will repay you
at any cost.

562
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:11,833
- Come!
- Hey!

563
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,583
- Kashi... Mr Kashi...
- Sara!

564
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:15,041
- Please leave my daughter.
- Sara!

565
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:19,291
I'm taking her as collateral
so you don't run away.

566
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:21,041
Give me my money

567
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,416
- and take her with you.
- Please leave her.

568
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:26,166
Make the principal
payment within three days.

569
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:28,041
If you don't repay the loan quickly,

570
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:30,666
- I'll make her repay in my own way.
- No. Please leave her.

571
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:37,333
Or the other option is...

572
00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:39,291
To get the money back from you

573
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:41,666
by I'll have to make
her work as a prostitute.

574
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,666
Do you get it? Tell me.
What should I do with her?

575
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:46,791
Kaasi, I have another option.

576
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:00,208
There's a rule of collection.

577
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:04,416
You can seize his property
for the debt he owes you.

578
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:10,541
That chair, that table, her house.
Take whatever you want to.

579
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:14,416
But not that girl.
She is my property.

580
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:19,291
- Hey, don't try to tell me
what to do. - Dad.

581
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:22,166
Otherwise, you will
come to regret it.

582
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:24,416
The ones living off someone else

583
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,666
will now teach me my place, huh?

584
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:30,041
Leave the girl, or else
I'll bury you right here.

585
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:32,916
Just because Yelamanda
is sparing you,

586
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:35,583
doesn't mean you'll act
according to your will.

587
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:38,708
Why do you wish to get yourself
into trouble because of this girl?

588
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:42,583
Do you not realise that
Yelamanda is the MLA?

589
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:45,708
It'll take less than three
seconds to get rid of you.

590
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:48,916
Do you want Sara or Stuartpuram?

591
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:58,166
You desire something
which is not yours. Sara is mine.

592
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:03,333
She'll always be, and
so will Stuartpuram.

593
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:04,666
Hey!

594
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,833
- Hey!
- Kaasi.

595
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,833
Don't do anything.
The boss will take care of him.

596
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,625
Let's go.

597
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:46,833
Kaasi let's go.
Understand the situation.

598
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:48,958
We'll take of him later. Let's go.

599
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:52,458
Kaasi and his pets, hear me out.

600
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,458
Starting tomorrow, Stuartpuram
will be under my ownership.

601
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:02,333
Any gang operating in Stuartpuram
must pay taxes to me, not you.

602
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:05,500
Nageshwar Rao is not
known for Stuartpuram.

603
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:09,083
Stuartpuram will be
known for Nageshwar Rao!

604
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:11,083
For Nageshwar Rao!

605
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:12,333
Let's go Kaasi.

606
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,875
Come on.

607
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:22,083
[music]

608
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:44,916
'Now it was time to
attack Madras port.'

609
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,500
'Nageshwar Rao's
life's biggest theft.'

610
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,125
'He abducted the most
important man of the support.'

611
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:58,625
Hey, tell me.

612
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:00,000
Speak up.

613
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:09,750
[man groaning in pain]

614
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:19,000
When and where is the gold arriving?

615
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:37,958
The ship carrying gold
will halt near the port.

616
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:41,083
We'll barge into the
ship and take the box.

617
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,625
Nagi!

618
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,208
Sister-in-law is here.

619
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:07,625
Who did this?

620
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:09,500
They'll marry her
off day after tomorrow.

621
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:16,250
I made every possible
effort to persuade them.

622
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,500
My dad isn't listening.

623
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:25,333
What shall we do?

624
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,125
Will you marry me?

625
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:31,458
Nagi, please hear me out.

626
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:35,333
Once we're married,
everything will be fine.

627
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,875
Come on, get ready to leave.

628
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:40,333
Nagi, tell me.

629
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,625
Nagi, the vehicle has arrived.

630
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:47,875
Are you all going somewhere?

631
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,083
Can't you stay for a day?

632
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:52,833
Please, Nagi, wait for a day.

633
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:56,083
At 05:00 AM sharp,
come to Chirala station.

634
00:51:58,083 --> 00:51:59,250
Nagi has given his word.

635
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:02,333
He won't do anything before the
wedding that will attract trouble.

636
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:03,958
Nagi, tell her.

637
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:05,500
Don't you worry.

638
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:14,208
Finish this quickly.
The ship is about to come.

639
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,458
'Hey, come here.'

640
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,458
'Yes, yes, sit over here.'

641
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:20,208
'Hey, what do you
think of yourself?'

642
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:21,958
[sound of the flare]

643
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:27,500
Nagi, Yaari has signal led.
The ship must have been docked.

644
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,625
'The Gold is in a container, it's
identification number is 459865.'

645
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,458
Where were you?
Why did you get so late?

646
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,000
Hurry up, or else
someone might see us.

647
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:31,625
'Every box within
the container will bear'

648
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,208
'a fish symbol
orientated to the right.'

649
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,208
'However...'

650
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:43,458
'The box containing the gold
will have the fish facing left.'

651
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:54,833
What's he applying?

652
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Acid, to melt the metal.

653
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:04,333
- Nagi, hurry up.
- I'm on it.

654
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:07,583
Come.

655
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:12,875
Over here.

656
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:17,083
Put this seal on the other box.

657
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:32,208
This is it. This is the box.

658
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:33,416
Take it away quickly.

659
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,375
Let’s get out 

660
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:58,875
This way

661
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,208
Where are Chote and Munaa?

662
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:29,083
'How did Andhra's
beedi reach Madras?'

663
00:55:30,625 --> 00:55:31,833
Give me some fire.

664
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:48,125
I've been ruling over the Madras
port for the last twenty years.

665
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:51,458
I know about everything
that goes on here.

666
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,750
And you tried to steal from me?

667
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:57,333
Now I'll cut you myself.

668
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,208
The time for the
dogs to bark is over.

669
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:09,958
Now listen to a lion's roar.

670
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,958
At the age when you're
playing with bat and ball,

671
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,250
I had already started doing murders.

672
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:19,500
At first, I only wanted to steal
but now I'll kill you all as well.

673
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:23,166
Dare to stop me

674
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:26,541
if you have the courage.

675
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:28,333
Bring him to me.

676
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:29,666
Go fast.

677
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:46,250
[groans]

678
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:47,458
Aghh.

679
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:08,583
Hey.

680
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,375
Aghh.

681
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:30,208
Hit him.

682
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:37,166
Surround him.

683
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:40,166
Hey.

684
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:54,875
Don't spare him.

685
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:02,125
[multiple shots fired]

686
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,041
'Is he a human or a monster?'

687
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:50,958
'He entered my area
and stole my gold.'

688
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:53,208
'Just wait and watch, he'll
snatch your chair as well.'

689
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:56,333
Don't worry.

690
00:59:56,666 --> 00:59:59,416
I'll retain my chair,
and you will have your gold.

691
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:01,833
Chote, stop smoking
beedi from now on.

692
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:04,291
Not your you but for us.

693
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,791
What's the matter?

694
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,375
Nagi, it's the police.

695
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:18,375
'Police, over here?
There's something wrong.'

696
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:20,750
Hide the gold at

697
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:22,375
the designated location.

698
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:25,375
Sara must be waiting for me at the
station. All of you take the boat.

699
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,500
Do you realise how worried I
was that you might not arrive?

700
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,333
Did you bring the nuptial thread?

701
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:33,708
Huh?

702
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:36,708
Don't worry, I bought that too.

703
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:40,083
What's wrong?

704
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:42,833
You appear to be troubled.

705
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:17,958
Last night, you made
the theft go very smoothly,

706
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:20,750
but how did you
forget to hide the bodies

707
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,583
of the people you killed?

708
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,458
The Madras police is here
to arrest you with proof.

709
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:40,083
Hey.

710
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:46,500
Go rot in the jail now.

711
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:50,750
Your dream of ruling over
Stuartpuram will never come to life.

712
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,208
Now Sara is mine,
and so is Stuartpuram.

713
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,750
Your property

714
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:05,083
is being seized by me.

715
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:10,750
Didn't I ask you?

716
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:13,333
Didn't I request you to
wait for just one day?

717
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,750
If you had waited for one day,

718
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:19,083
we would have been on that train.

719
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:22,458
This sacred thread would
have been on my neck.

720
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:30,416
Inspector, take him to Madras jail.

721
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:31,916
Sara.

722
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,708
- Sara.
- Let's go.

723
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,458
Sara. Sara.

724
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:38,500
- Let's go.
- Sara. Sara.

725
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:39,958
Sara, hear me out.

726
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:41,000
Take him away, come on.

727
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,750
Sara, don't do this.

728
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:44,208
Leave me.

729
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:45,208
No.

730
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:03,666
My daughter!

731
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:12,000
Nageshwar was not only in danger

732
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:14,833
from his enemies but
from his loved ones, too.

733
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:18,000
He murdered his father.

734
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:22,958
He became the reason for the girl
he loved to take her own life, too.

735
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:27,541
The police tortured
him a lot, but still

736
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:30,208
he refused to disclose the
whereabouts of the concealed gold.

737
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:32,750
Because the crime
occurred in Madras,

738
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:34,791
he was kept in Tamil Nadu's jail.

739
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,958
The court sentenced him
to life imprisonment.

740
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:44,208
He was caught. The story ends here.

741
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:48,208
Stuartpuram's Nageshwar
Rao's tale ended there.

742
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:50,250
However,

743
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:54,458
Tiger Nageshwar
Rao's saga begins now.

744
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:56,208
Hey! Open the door.

745
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:57,458
Quick!

746
01:04:58,208 --> 01:04:59,958
Hey! Open the door!

747
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:02,125
There he is.

748
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:19,416
Hey, what's the matter?
Why aren't you having your meal?

749
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,666
Just because the tiger is
held captive, it doesn't mean

750
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:24,958
he'll start eating grass.

751
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:27,291
This is jail and not
your in-laws' place.

752
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:30,416
When I said you must eat,
then you must eat.

753
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:31,416
Do you understand?

754
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:35,041
When I get out of this prison
tomorrow, I'll then have food.

755
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:39,083
Hey, this is the largest
jail in South India.

756
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:41,958
To date, three hundred
men have tried to escape.

757
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,708
Not even one managed
to escape from here.

758
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:46,083
Escape if you can!

759
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:48,041
I want to see if you can escape.

760
01:05:48,166 --> 01:05:49,458
Try your best. You...

761
01:05:58,166 --> 01:06:00,666
Even our trained dogs
can jump up to six feet, sir.

762
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,791
This wall is nine
feet taller than that.

763
01:06:08,541 --> 01:06:11,416
Sir, even in the Olympics, the
record for the high jump is 8.25 feet.

764
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:13,208
But this wall is
higher than 15 feet.

765
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:18,416
'To climb on a wall that high,
the run must be at least 70 km/h.'

766
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:20,916
'The officers were baffled that'

767
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:23,916
'the jump was only possible
for a tiger or a cheetah to make;'

768
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:26,541
'how could a human do that?'

769
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:36,041
He escaped like a
tiger and escaped, sir.

770
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:38,916
Not like a tiger, he is a tiger.

771
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,125
Nageshwar Roa was yearning
to take revenge for Sara's death.

772
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,666
After escaping the jail,

773
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,875
he went straight to Kaasi
and Yelmanda's factory.

774
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:56,250
He beheaded twenty-four
men with a single axe over there.

775
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:04,791
And from that day
on, Tiger is missing.

776
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:06,625
This guy is a serious threat.

777
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,625
Beef up PM's security.

778
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:10,750
And everybody on their toes.

779
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:12,250
- Sir.
- Sir, sorry to interrupt you

780
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:13,500
but I cannot comprehend.

781
01:07:13,666 --> 01:07:15,375
Why beef up PM's security?

782
01:07:15,416 --> 01:07:17,291
Nageshwar Rao sent a letter stating

783
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,750
that he'll rob the PM's
house within 48 hours.

784
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:21,458
It's a threat, it's a challenge.

785
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:24,250
Sir, this thing shouldn't
escape this room.

786
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:26,208
If they really robbed

787
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,708
the PM's house, then we'll become

788
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:31,541
a laughing stock in front of
the entire world. Please, sir.

789
01:07:31,625 --> 01:07:33,125
Mr. VIP security!

790
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:36,000
It's not some central jail
where you can leap and escape.

791
01:07:36,583 --> 01:07:38,083
It's a three-wing security force.

792
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:43,333
Despite years of efforts, no one was
able to breach the PM's security.

793
01:07:43,583 --> 01:07:45,250
I know he's good, but
he is not good enough.

794
01:07:45,333 --> 01:07:46,333
And I will prove it.

795
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:48,333
Follow me.

796
01:08:15,041 --> 01:08:17,791
Sir, I made all the arrangements
as per your command.

797
01:08:17,833 --> 01:08:19,666
Good! All checked?

798
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:24,416
- Sir.
- Mr. Singh, go to gate one.

799
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:25,666
And you go to gate two.

800
01:08:30,416 --> 01:08:32,291
- Where is the PM?
- Sir, she is upstairs.

801
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:33,791
- Security, alert.
- Okay, sir.

802
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:38,291
You go that side.

803
01:08:38,416 --> 01:08:39,666
Yes sir. Come.

804
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:30,875
'Security, alert. Alert.
Open gate number three.'

805
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:32,125
'Madam is coming.'

806
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:43,875
Sastry, what did you say?

807
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:47,708
That he says everything beforehand

808
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:50,250
and then does what he says.

809
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:52,500
Where is he?

810
01:09:52,541 --> 01:09:53,416
- Sir, I...
- Breaching

811
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,000
the PM's security isn't
that easy, understood?

812
01:09:58,750 --> 01:09:59,625
Stop.

813
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
- For whom is that?
- For madam, sir.

814
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:03,625
- For madam?
- Yes, sir.

815
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:05,375
But she just...

816
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,166
Madam Prime Minister!

817
01:10:17,791 --> 01:10:18,750
Yes, Rajput.

818
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:27,916
Gate eight alert,
stop the convoy right now.

819
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:42,000
What happened, Rajput?

820
01:10:43,916 --> 01:10:46,125
Sorry ma'am. It's just a routine check.

821
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,416
- Sorry for the inconvenience.
- It's okay.

822
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:49,875
Let the convoy leave.

823
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:01,791
Sir, if madam is in the convoy,

824
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:02,875
then...

825
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:11,875
He couldn't have come inside
without any help from one of us.

826
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,291
Gather every officer stationed here.

827
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:16,041
I will personally investigate them.

828
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:18,375
Sir, everyone has arrived.
I've verified the entire list.

829
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,000
However, Sastry sir's driver,
that soldier is missing.

830
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:24,333
My driver?

831
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:27,125
You had sent him to receive
me at the airport, right?

832
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:28,750
So I thought he is
from the Delhi police.

833
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:29,958
Who said that to you?

834
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,208
He was with you, so we
thought he was assigned to you.

835
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:34,208
Or else we wouldn't have
permitted him to get in.

836
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,000
But, sir, I...

837
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,000
Remember this voice well.

838
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:40,375
One who treads
through the forest must

839
01:11:40,416 --> 01:11:42,750
understand the Tiger's
movements and the

840
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:45,666
police who work here
must recognise this voice.

841
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:47,000
- Taxi.
- Sir.

842
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:48,875
Sir.

843
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:52,583
Narasimha Raju, sir. Delhi Police.???

844
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,458
I am posted here for
the last seven years.

845
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:06,875
Sir, whoever saw Nageshwar
Rao were either killed

846
01:12:07,208 --> 01:12:09,125
or kept their mouths
shut due to his terror.

847
01:12:09,416 --> 01:12:11,333
I have never seen him either

848
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:36,458
A known criminal was standing right
besides you, instead of catching him

849
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,500
you disclosed all the
security details in front of him.

850
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:41,583
How can you be so careless?

851
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:42,750
Shame on you.

852
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:44,875
- But madam Prime Minister,
actually... - Hmm.

853
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:48,708
He was in this compound
for 12 hours.

854
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:50,833
He had a pistol.

855
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:52,458
I was in close proximity.

856
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:55,083
You understand the
meaning of this, right?

857
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:58,958
Madam Prime Minister,
grant us one week.

858
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,208
We will find him and eliminate him.

859
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:04,125
We will ensure that news of his
encounter does not leak as well.

860
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:07,333
Just think, why did he
risk his life to come here?

861
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:09,916
If his goal was to steal,

862
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:13,333
he is smart enough to
empty even the Reserve Bank.

863
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:15,666
His goal wasn't robbery, Rajput.

864
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:16,958
It's something else.

865
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:21,333
Figure out what he wants

866
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,083
and then eliminate him.

867
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:27,000
Criminals like him
don't deserve to live.

868
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:30,625
This is the letter he left.

869
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,375
'Respected Prime Minister,'

870
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:44,041
'I did as promised.'

871
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,541
'I am taking one of
your prized possessions.'

872
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:49,875
'I urge you not to fire
your security detail.'

873
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,916
'For the last 48 hours, they
made great efforts to stop me.'

874
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
'Yours sincerely, Tiger
Nageshwar Rao. Stuartpuram.'

875
01:13:56,291 --> 01:13:58,666
Sir, he is genuinely a good man.

876
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:00,500
He saved us.

877
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:04,208
'What exactly did
he steal from here?'

878
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:22,375
You must have seen
a tiger hunting deer.

879
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:26,375
But I'm the tiger who
hunts other tigers.

880
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:30,916
I like to declare war
before starting a war.

881
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:47,958
So you lost your way
from the neighbouring

882
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:49,541
village and ended
up in Stuartpuram?

883
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:56,291
And you have lost your wallet, too.
Should I bring you something to eat?

884
01:14:57,958 --> 01:14:58,833
Hmm.

885
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,416
POLICE ALERT - AWARD OF 10000 ON
CATCHING STUARTPURAM NAGESWARA RAO

886
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:12,041
I see his posters everywhere I look.

887
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:16,291
Even the villagers are
only talking about him.

888
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:21,166
Even the police said that they
won't spare you until he surrenders.

889
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:23,833
Who is this man?

890
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:25,916
Whoever catches him

891
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:27,916
will be rewarded with a
sum of 10,000 rupees.

892
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:30,833
Is he some monster?

893
01:15:35,208 --> 01:15:39,583
After escaping the prison,
he killed the MLA's brother.

894
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:43,041
And since then, the police
has been looking for him.

895
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:46,333
And until they find him,
they've held us captive.

896
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:53,291
But tiger isn't a vilian but a hero.

897
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:57,541
So what the police
are saying isn't right?

898
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:05,708
'The forest where we grew
up was snatched from us'

899
01:16:05,791 --> 01:16:08,708
'and we were thrown over here with
a false promise of development.'

900
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:12,166
'They told us to farm over
here and live a happy life'

901
01:16:12,208 --> 01:16:14,083
'but the land over here was barren.'

902
01:16:14,666 --> 01:16:17,208
'We were forced to choose hunting.'

903
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:19,041
'Even when we wished
to work as labourers,

904
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:21,416
we were accused
of stealing and let go.'

905
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:23,583
If there's any truth

906
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:27,166
in this world, it's only hunger.

907
01:16:28,916 --> 01:16:33,041
In order to get two meals a day,
you don't just need to work hard

908
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:37,916
but you need to put your
lives on stake over here as well.

909
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:43,041
Looking at all the injustice,
tiger couldn't stop himself.

910
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:47,416
At that time, he was 18 years old.

911
01:16:48,166 --> 01:16:51,291
'The crime could happen anywhere,
but the police used to mark the'

912
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:55,041
'residents of Stuartpuram as
criminals and take them away.'

913
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:58,166
'We were paid to become
criminals and the auction happened'

914
01:16:58,208 --> 01:17:00,166
'in the opposite way.'

915
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:03,041
Who'll take the blame for a
theft at Guntur Railway Station?

916
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:05,166
Who wants to bid the lowest?
Star bidding.

917
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:06,916
A 100 rupees, sir.

918
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:10,541
- 80 rupees, sir.
- 60 rupees, sir.

919
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:16,083
'Jewellery worth 5,000 were stolen.'

920
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:18,666
'Everyone from the top to the
bottom had received their share.'

921
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:21,583
'And the residents of
Stuartpuram only got 60'

922
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:24,333
'rupees to do the jail
time for that crime.'

923
01:17:24,416 --> 01:17:28,416
You can get a maximum of six
months of punishment for theft.

924
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:31,208
And these people are asking for

925
01:17:31,791 --> 01:17:34,583
60 rupees for such a little jail
time. They've become greedy.

926
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:36,541
Hey, put him in the car.

927
01:17:42,166 --> 01:17:42,916
Sir.

928
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:45,666
Where's the thief who was caught
stealing at Guntur Railway Station?

929
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:47,583
He is the one, sir.

930
01:17:48,791 --> 01:17:51,166
You little mole. That
jewellery was worth 5000.

931
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:52,416
Where did you sell them?

932
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:54,041
Tell me, where did
you pawn them? Tell me.

933
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:55,083
- Tell me.
- I didn't do anything.

934
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:57,791
I am from Stuartpuram. I was
paid 60 rupees to take the blame.

935
01:17:58,166 --> 01:18:00,791
What is he saying?
You make them lie?

936
01:18:00,916 --> 01:18:01,916
- Sir, he is lying.
- Sir.

937
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:03,416
That kid is telling the truth.

938
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:05,416
This is how the Stuartpuram
police station operates, sir.

939
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:07,958
They take a hefty sum from
the real thief and let them go.

940
01:18:08,208 --> 01:18:10,166
And then they frame
someone from Stuartpuram

941
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:12,291
saying the stolen
goods were not found.

942
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
You are suspended.

943
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:17,625
Sir, please listen to me.

944
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:20,500
- You've made a joke out of the law.
- Sir, please, I won't do it again.

945
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:22,250
Sir, you may keep a 1000 rupees.

946
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,541
What did you say to me?
Do you think I take bribes?

947
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:27,625
- You're fired.
- Sir, take 2000 rupees.

948
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,166
I want it by evening.

949
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:36,250
Sir.

950
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:41,000
I made a loss of 7000
rupees because of you.

951
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:04,750
My son!

952
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:08,458
My kid! My kid.

953
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:11,250
You killed my son.

954
01:19:11,583 --> 01:19:14,500
He opened his mouth after
just a couple of beatings.

955
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:18,125
Have you stopped feeding
donkey milk to the kids?

956
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:20,833
Do feed them or
else they'll die sooner.

957
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:26,333
Before he died, he told the truth
about Stuartpuram to the DSP.

958
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:28,583
As punishment, the orders are to

959
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:30,708
frame all of you for
all the pending cases.

960
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,875
And this time, we don't
want old, weak, or ill people.

961
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:36,958
I will take away good
and strong men with me.

962
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:40,125
Like the one who's standing
at the back over there.

963
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:42,333
Catch him.

964
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:43,458
Him too.

965
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:44,958
Hey.

966
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,583
Get the one who's
standing at the back.

967
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:48,875
- Hey, where are you running?
- You killed my kid.

968
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:54,750
My son!

969
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,125
Hey!

970
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:00,500
Hey you! Stop! Where
are you escaping?

971
01:20:00,583 --> 01:20:01,958
Sir, please!

972
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:06,458
Nagi, look, they killed my son.

973
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:09,625
Ambedkar's education
brought about a transformation

974
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:11,625
in the entire community.

975
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:14,958
'Sir, please let me go.'

976
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:36,791
'Like the first ray of the sun
brings hope for everyone,'

977
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:39,791
'Stuartpuram took
a breath of relief that day.'

978
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:42,416
'That day, we learned
to live again.'

979
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:46,541
'The name of that ray of hope
was Nageswara Rao.'

980
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:53,500
'I will play the game of auction
with you today. Let's play.'

981
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:57,875
'Someone bashed and injured
the policeman of Stuartpuram.'

982
01:20:57,916 --> 01:21:01,000
'Hey, Nageswara, are you crazy?
Will you attack the police?'

983
01:21:01,041 --> 01:21:04,041
- 'Start bidding.
- I'm bidding 300 bucks.'

984
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,500
'I'm bidding 350.'

985
01:21:05,625 --> 01:21:07,375
'Hey, crush his bones!'

986
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:33,541
- 'Hit him!
- Yeah! Bash him.'

987
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:35,916
- 'Hit him.
- Hit him a lot.'

988
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:44,000
'Hey, Nageswara!
Don't mess with the police.'

989
01:22:44,291 --> 01:22:46,125
'You don't know what I can do.'

990
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:48,000
'Yes, you won't be spared.'

991
01:22:52,416 --> 01:22:54,500
'Strike him, Nageswara. Kill him.'

992
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:17,875
- 'Hit them. - Hit them.
- Hit them a lot.'

993
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:30,500
'No lives will be auctioned
in Stuartpuram starting today.'

994
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:36,750
'Nageswara Rao decided to
educate every child in Stuartpuram.'

995
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:44,208
'You might recognise him.'

996
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:47,750
'People pay fees to read and write.'

997
01:23:47,833 --> 01:23:49,833
'But without giving it
a second thought,'

998
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,958
'he battled death to study.'

999
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,833
'If we enrol him,
everyone will think'

1000
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:55,958
'that we are promoting robbery.'

1001
01:23:56,708 --> 01:23:58,208
'You can also say'

1002
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,583
'that you're teaching the son
of a thief to live a decent life.'

1003
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:05,083
'We are not born as thieves.'

1004
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:07,208
'Our circumstances have
turned us into thieves.'

1005
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:09,000
'Now, we want to fight
those circumstances'

1006
01:24:09,708 --> 01:24:12,750
'and change. Please don't snatch
this opportunity from them.'

1007
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:19,708
'Changing his ways will
require health and books.'

1008
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:21,000
'Who will pay for their food?'

1009
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:24,625
'Sir, that responsibility is mine.
They will never starve.'

1010
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:31,000
'Starting from tomorrow, nobody
can stop you from attending school.'

1011
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:34,375
'Yay!'

1012
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:41,250
The food on this plate
is also Nageswara's mercy.

1013
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:45,208
The government was sending grains

1014
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:46,833
for the flood victims.

1015
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:48,458
Those grains were in the train.

1016
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:54,208
But, some MLAs and politicians used
to distribute it amongst themselves.

1017
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,708
Before that could happen, Nageswara
risked his life to steal it.

1018
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:07,458
He distributed the aid
among the villagers

1019
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:10,875
and flood victims, and that aid
is still feeding them.

1020
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:24,791
You claim that Nageswara
is a good man.

1021
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:28,208
Then, why did he murder
those 24 people?

1022
01:25:32,416 --> 01:25:36,541
'Nageswara Rao wanted employment
for the youth of Stuartpuram.'

1023
01:25:36,916 --> 01:25:39,458
'But he didn't know how.'

1024
01:25:42,041 --> 01:25:45,583
'Despite being educated,
nobody had employment.'

1025
01:25:46,416 --> 01:25:48,041
'How can we find
employment for everyone?'

1026
01:25:53,291 --> 01:25:55,333
- 'Won't you say something?
- Let's see what he says.'

1027
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:59,291
'Sir, why don't we construct
a factory over here?'

1028
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:04,666
'Yes, Sir. We'll be able to earn our
daily living if we are independent.'

1029
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:09,166
'It will secure our future.
The educated will get a job.'

1030
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:11,583
'It will also give some income
to the labourers.'

1031
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:14,333
'The idea is excellent.'

1032
01:26:14,583 --> 01:26:17,958
'But will the government
permit us to build a factory?'

1033
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:21,416
'Let's apply for it first.'

1034
01:26:23,041 --> 01:26:25,291
'What about the expenses
required to set up the factory?'

1035
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,666
'Nageswara Rao needed money
to set up a factory in Stuartpuram.'

1036
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,250
'That's when he stole 300 kg of gold
from the Madras court.'

1037
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:36,250
'He hid that gold somewhere.'

1038
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:38,375
'Tell me, where did you
hide the gold?'

1039
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,291
'It's not merely gold.'

1040
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:44,583
'It represents the future
of Stuartpuram.'

1041
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:47,083
'I won't reveal it,
even if my life is at stake.'

1042
01:26:47,125 --> 01:26:50,333
'Yelamanda feared that
a factory in Stuartpuram'

1043
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:52,583
'would end his rule.'

1044
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:55,916
'Sir, try as much as you want,
but he won't reveal anything.'

1045
01:26:56,125 --> 01:26:58,208
'He is not telling me where
he hid the gold.'

1046
01:26:58,583 --> 01:27:00,375
'Catch the college students.'

1047
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,750
'They might know
the gold's location.'

1048
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:06,666
'The cops crushed his bones.'

1049
01:27:06,958 --> 01:27:09,333
'But they couldn't crush his will.'

1050
01:27:09,583 --> 01:27:11,791
'His heart was already broken.'

1051
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:14,208
'That's why,
despite the life sentence,'

1052
01:27:14,291 --> 01:27:16,541
'he didn't have a single
wrinkle on his face.'

1053
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:19,791
'Why do you look so upset?'

1054
01:27:20,041 --> 01:27:22,083
'Have you commenced the
construction of the factory?'

1055
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:24,083
'Are the villagers happy?'

1056
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:27,791
'Will I get a job in the factory?'

1057
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:31,458
'Or do people who have lived
in the jail not get jobs?'

1058
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:43,625
'These kids gave Nageswara
the idea of a factory.'

1059
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:45,791
'They will know where the gold is.'

1060
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:47,291
'But they're
not revealing anything.'

1061
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:49,041
'Where is the gold?'

1062
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:51,916
'We don't know, Sir.'

1063
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:57,000
'Do you know what this is?'

1064
01:27:58,041 --> 01:28:00,541
'An application seeking permission'

1065
01:28:00,625 --> 01:28:02,875
'from the government
to set up a factory?'

1066
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:11,416
'None of you have enough money
to earn your daily bread.'

1067
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:15,500
'So, how did you acquire
the funds to construct a factory?'

1068
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:19,375
'Did you sell the stolen gold
to set up your factory?'

1069
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:23,125
'Nageswara Sir went to jail for us.'

1070
01:28:23,375 --> 01:28:25,875
'You can kill us if you want.'

1071
01:28:26,375 --> 01:28:28,416
'But we won't disclose
the whereabouts of the gold.'

1072
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:36,625
'There is a party meeting
that I need to attend.'

1073
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,666
'I want the gold. Do as you please.'

1074
01:28:47,083 --> 01:28:47,958
Attack!

1075
01:28:56,625 --> 01:28:58,000
He is the only one who remains.

1076
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:00,958
Don't let anything happen to
him, or we won't find the gold.

1077
01:29:01,458 --> 01:29:02,833
Just drug him.

1078
01:29:03,083 --> 01:29:05,125
He'll then start
speaking everything.

1079
01:29:23,666 --> 01:29:25,666
Nageswara Rao was the first person

1080
01:29:25,791 --> 01:29:29,458
who was successful in eloping
from Madras Central Jail.

1081
01:29:36,291 --> 01:29:38,041
Hey, Nagi.

1082
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:42,958
We put that gold near the students.

1083
01:29:43,166 --> 01:29:46,291
But Kasi killed all of them.

1084
01:29:49,041 --> 01:29:49,833
Sir.

1085
01:29:50,166 --> 01:29:50,958
Sir.

1086
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:54,291
Nageswara Rao
escaped from Madras jail.

1087
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:55,541
Let him come.

1088
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:57,625
There are 40 of us.

1089
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:03,041
400 guards were present in
the jail that he ran away from.

1090
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:04,875
Go and run for your life.

1091
01:30:11,125 --> 01:30:13,000
Looks like he has come here.

1092
01:30:13,125 --> 01:30:14,250
Finish him.

1093
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:40,375
Why are you going one by one?
Hit him together.

1094
01:33:10,708 --> 01:33:14,958
No matter how many flocks
of sheep surround the tiger,

1095
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:17,958
instead of preying on the tiger,

1096
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:21,166
they become the
tiger's prey instead.

1097
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:26,916
When a hungry tiger goes on a hunt,

1098
01:33:27,041 --> 01:33:29,416
he calms down
after he gets his prey.

1099
01:33:29,416 --> 01:33:32,041
But Nageswara Rao
created havoc that day.

1100
01:33:32,166 --> 01:33:35,416
He created the most horrific
event in the history of crimes.

1101
01:33:35,666 --> 01:33:40,291
He killed around
24 people with just an axe.

1102
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:03,833
Hey!

1103
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:07,041
Hey!

1104
01:34:12,291 --> 01:34:14,458
Kasi... Hey.

1105
01:34:18,541 --> 01:34:20,083
Hey, Kasi.

1106
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:38,125
No. Leave him.

1107
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:42,875
No... Have mercy.

1108
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:47,250
A lion doesn't return home without
killing when he goes for hunt.

1109
01:35:16,875 --> 01:35:20,250
Yelamanda's brother Kasi
was killed in front of him.

1110
01:35:20,333 --> 01:35:21,833
This was a declaration of war.

1111
01:35:21,875 --> 01:35:25,250
The police of the whole state
were searching for Nageswara Rao.

1112
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:28,291
- Who is he?
- Nageswara Rao from Stuartpuram.

1113
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:31,625
Hey! Not Nageshwar Rao,

1114
01:35:31,666 --> 01:35:33,625
call him Tiger Nageswara Rao!

1115
01:35:35,625 --> 01:35:39,625
The one who didn't shed
a tear when his father died,

1116
01:35:40,291 --> 01:35:43,125
the one who didn't
cry when he lost Sara,

1117
01:35:44,041 --> 01:35:48,375
many years later, his eyes got teary
due to the death of those children.

1118
01:35:57,250 --> 01:36:01,583
Nageswara is hiding somewhere
after killing Yelamanda and his men.

1119
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:05,833
That's why, the
police are after him.

1120
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,458
Whenever a tiger hides,

1121
01:36:08,833 --> 01:36:10,583
it's never to get saved.

1122
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:13,458
He always hides to attack.

1123
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:20,083
Stuartpuram is under
police surveillance.

1124
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,958
Houses are being searched.

1125
01:36:22,458 --> 01:36:24,708
It was dangerous to live
there, so I brought him here.

1126
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:26,458
The police will come
here if I live here.

1127
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:28,000
The police don't know that

1128
01:36:28,333 --> 01:36:31,333
you're hiding in your
father's best friend's place.

1129
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:34,375
After your mother passed away,

1130
01:36:34,458 --> 01:36:36,708
there has been no
communication between us.

1131
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:41,291
Do you remember your childhood
friend, Mani or did you forget her?

1132
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:49,625
Okay, that's enough now.

1133
01:36:49,666 --> 01:36:51,166
He's going to stay
here for ten days.

1134
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:53,041
You'll get many
chances to impress him.

1135
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:54,250
Come inside.

1136
01:36:56,125 --> 01:36:57,333
Why just ten days?

1137
01:36:57,958 --> 01:37:01,833
Once he sees me like this,
he'll probably propose to me.

1138
01:37:09,041 --> 01:37:10,791
Hey Mani. How are you?

1139
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:15,291
Look, Nagi has come.
Make some fish for him.

1140
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:32,000
'Why isn't he paying
attention to me?'

1141
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:35,833
'Fine. I will serve less rice.'

1142
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:38,583
'He'll have to look at
me if he needs more.'

1143
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Mani cooks fantastic fish fry.

1144
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:44,291
Nagi, too, likes dried fish a lot.

1145
01:37:50,916 --> 01:37:52,041
'You still won't look at me?'

1146
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:57,166
'Fine. I will serve
less fish as well.'

1147
01:37:58,166 --> 01:38:00,791
'Now, I'll see how
he doesn't look at me.'

1148
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:27,166
Did you catch Nagi?

1149
01:38:27,625 --> 01:38:28,375
Sir.

1150
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:33,166
Did you catch Nagi?

1151
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:35,250
We're trying, sir.

1152
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:39,500
You're trying.

1153
01:38:41,375 --> 01:38:45,750
He slashed my brother into
pieces in front of my eyes.

1154
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,666
When the axe is hit in the chest,

1155
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:52,750
it slices the chest
with every breath.

1156
01:38:52,791 --> 01:38:54,625
Do you know that, commissioner?

1157
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:58,875
Go away.

1158
01:39:00,875 --> 01:39:05,791
In order to hunt the rat, his
burrows need to be torched up.

1159
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:10,625
Gather the whole village
in the police station.

1160
01:39:12,416 --> 01:39:15,166
Sister, this engagement is
happening with your consent, right?

1161
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:16,416
Yes.

1162
01:39:16,666 --> 01:39:18,791
Are you aware that this
is his second marriage?

1163
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:19,750
I know.

1164
01:39:19,916 --> 01:39:21,875
It seems he has a
daughter your age.

1165
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,666
I know.

1166
01:39:24,416 --> 01:39:27,125
If everything goes as
planned, then along with him,

1167
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:29,416
he will also marry
off his daughter.

1168
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,666
But you mentioned
that you liked Nagi.

1169
01:39:31,916 --> 01:39:33,666
That's why we arranged
this matchmaking.

1170
01:39:37,375 --> 01:39:42,000
Hmm! Now tell me. What
if Nagi sees me like this?

1171
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:45,666
In order to appear
attractive to Nagi,

1172
01:39:45,708 --> 01:39:47,541
you agreed to the engagement.

1173
01:40:07,666 --> 01:40:09,916
Hey, Nagi. Yelamanda ran away.

1174
01:40:10,416 --> 01:40:13,291
He is about to frame false cases
on our people at the police station.

1175
01:40:13,375 --> 01:40:15,291
Do something or
everything will be ruined.

1176
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:22,000
Hey, come here and place
your thumb impression.

1177
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:24,458
- Do it. Go.
- Let us go.

1178
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:29,375
Sir! Don't ruin our children's future

1179
01:40:30,083 --> 01:40:32,625
- Please, sir!
- Let us go.

1180
01:40:32,875 --> 01:40:35,083
Sir, please.

1181
01:40:35,250 --> 01:40:37,750
Sir, if our names are
listed in police records,

1182
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:39,541
it will be impossible
for us to secure a job.

1183
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:42,416
We will have to be
thieves like our ancestors.

1184
01:40:42,458 --> 01:40:44,750
It might be better if
you end our lives, sir.

1185
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:48,458
I have no interest
in ending your lives.

1186
01:40:48,833 --> 01:40:52,083
I want to end your dreams.

1187
01:40:52,583 --> 01:40:54,875
The dream of honesty.

1188
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:59,083
Earning honestly,
living a dignified life...

1189
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:01,958
I need to crush that dream.

1190
01:41:02,208 --> 01:41:06,041
Come here. He has
been a topper in college.

1191
01:41:06,208 --> 01:41:09,583
Don't accuse this guy of theft.

1192
01:41:09,958 --> 01:41:12,333
It will tarnish the
gentleman's reputation.

1193
01:41:12,708 --> 01:41:14,333
Just file a murder
case against him.

1194
01:41:14,583 --> 01:41:16,958
One of our men has committed
a murder in the village Kaava.

1195
01:41:17,125 --> 01:41:18,458
We need a scapegoat for that.

1196
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,083
Pin that case on him.

1197
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:24,208
Sir... sir... sir...
Let my brother go.

1198
01:41:24,333 --> 01:41:26,125
Sir, his life will be ruined.

1199
01:41:26,208 --> 01:41:29,333
Don't do this, sir.
Sir, I beg of you.

1200
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:32,833
Please let him go. Have
some mercy on my brother.

1201
01:41:47,541 --> 01:41:48,333
Sir...

1202
01:41:49,916 --> 01:41:52,333
I knew that you'd surely come.

1203
01:41:52,416 --> 01:41:56,583
Look around. A lot of
guns are aimed at you.

1204
01:41:57,083 --> 01:42:00,500
I won't make the mistake of
just sticking an axe and leaving.

1205
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:05,500
I will keep pumping bullets
into you till your heart stops.

1206
01:42:05,875 --> 01:42:08,708
Last time I hit your
chest with an axe.

1207
01:42:09,083 --> 01:42:12,625
But this time, I will I'll detach
your head from your body.

1208
01:42:12,708 --> 01:42:14,458
What are you looking at? Shoot him.

1209
01:42:15,708 --> 01:42:16,708
Hey.

1210
01:42:24,291 --> 01:42:25,291
Hey.

1211
01:42:35,041 --> 01:42:35,791
Sir.

1212
01:42:36,208 --> 01:42:37,333
It's gunpowder, sir.

1213
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:41,541
I acquired 30 kilos of
it for a heist in Madras.

1214
01:42:41,583 --> 01:42:43,666
But only five kilos
were needed there.

1215
01:42:44,083 --> 01:42:45,916
25 kilos is still remaining.

1216
01:42:47,458 --> 01:42:48,541
Mallika.

1217
01:42:49,041 --> 01:42:50,041
Sumathi.

1218
01:42:56,958 --> 01:42:58,958
What are you looking at? Shoot him.

1219
01:42:59,333 --> 01:43:01,833
We celebrated Holi
with you with gunpowder.

1220
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,833
Even if there is a spark,

1221
01:43:03,958 --> 01:43:06,083
you'll burn like the
Diwali firecrackers.

1222
01:43:06,375 --> 01:43:09,333
Indeed, sir. Gunpowder
is highly explosive.

1223
01:43:09,625 --> 01:43:12,208
Everyone will turn into ashes.
We have no other option.

1224
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:13,500
We'll have to let them go, sir.

1225
01:43:27,041 --> 01:43:29,750
Picking locks and killing people

1226
01:43:29,875 --> 01:43:32,166
has been a game for
me since childhood.

1227
01:43:32,416 --> 01:43:34,250
If I kill you today,

1228
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:37,375
people will turn you into a martyr.

1229
01:43:37,583 --> 01:43:39,250
I don't want you to be respected.

1230
01:43:39,875 --> 01:43:44,250
I want to humiliate you by starting
a factory in front of your eyes.

1231
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,875
On the day of the
factory's inauguration,

1232
01:43:46,916 --> 01:43:48,875
you will lose your head.

1233
01:43:51,125 --> 01:43:52,375
This is Tiger's promise.

1234
01:44:07,916 --> 01:44:09,750
We don't need rented goons.

1235
01:44:09,791 --> 01:44:11,750
We need someone
who has enmity like us.

1236
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,291
I know a guy who can get it done.

1237
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:17,583
CI Mouli.

1238
01:44:18,041 --> 01:44:20,041
He hates Nagi a lot.

1239
01:44:30,541 --> 01:44:31,833
Call him soon.

1240
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,625
Do you know what you're doing?

1241
01:44:40,083 --> 01:44:43,333
Will you become a second wife?
He has a daughter of your age.

1242
01:44:43,375 --> 01:44:45,250
Why are you ruining your life?

1243
01:44:45,625 --> 01:44:46,875
You'll find someone else.

1244
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:49,208
Fix the wedding date, Dad.

1245
01:44:49,708 --> 01:44:51,833
Just think about it once again.

1246
01:44:52,333 --> 01:44:54,333
I have thought about it, Dad.

1247
01:44:59,958 --> 01:45:02,500
Nagi. I hope no one saw
you coming over here.

1248
01:45:03,583 --> 01:45:05,708
Don't sacrifice
for your little sister.

1249
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:08,375
I will take care of your
wedding expenses.

1250
01:45:08,875 --> 01:45:11,125
Uncle, look for a
good groom for her.

1251
01:45:11,583 --> 01:45:12,708
That's not required.

1252
01:45:12,958 --> 01:45:15,500
Uncle, I have to talk
to Mani for a moment.

1253
01:45:18,791 --> 01:45:21,208
He is marrying again
while his wife is still alive.

1254
01:45:21,833 --> 01:45:24,083
What if he marries for the
third time after he marries you?

1255
01:45:24,625 --> 01:45:28,125
Then, I would have two
co-wives instead of one.

1256
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:33,291
Listen, Nagi.

1257
01:45:34,291 --> 01:45:36,416
If we end up liking someone,

1258
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:38,833
it's hard to like someone else.

1259
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:43,833
It doesn't matter if the person
that I don't like is married or not.

1260
01:45:48,416 --> 01:45:49,791
Do you want to eat dried fish?

1261
01:45:51,166 --> 01:45:53,166
Do you want them
fried or with soup?

1262
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:55,291
Mani.

1263
01:45:59,375 --> 01:46:00,416
What do you want?

1264
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,291
I'm not asking you
to marry me, Nagi.

1265
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:08,041
If I can't marry you, then it
doesn't matter whom I marry.

1266
01:46:10,125 --> 01:46:13,500
Alright. Look for another match
if that gives you some relief.

1267
01:46:13,958 --> 01:46:15,458
It doesn't make
much difference to me.

1268
01:46:18,041 --> 01:46:19,500
I'm making a soup out of them.

1269
01:46:21,416 --> 01:46:22,666
You don't know about me.

1270
01:46:23,291 --> 01:46:25,541
The entire state
police are after me.

1271
01:46:26,875 --> 01:46:29,500
The whole Madras police
is doing that as well, right?

1272
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,375
You've escaped from
the Madras prison, right?

1273
01:46:33,958 --> 01:46:35,958
I've killed 24 people.

1274
01:46:36,125 --> 01:46:39,083
It would have been 25 if
you had killed that MLA.

1275
01:46:41,083 --> 01:46:42,833
Don't spare the MLA, Nagi.

1276
01:46:47,208 --> 01:46:49,208
One. Two.

1277
01:46:49,458 --> 01:46:51,708
I, too, loved a girl.

1278
01:46:56,708 --> 01:46:58,000
I lost the count.

1279
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:00,500
Only one girl?

1280
01:47:01,708 --> 01:47:05,208
You've been with almost all the
prostitutes of Chilakaluripeta.

1281
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:09,458
There are shoot-at-sight
orders in my name.

1282
01:47:09,875 --> 01:47:11,875
I don't know when the
police will do my encounter.

1283
01:47:20,875 --> 01:47:22,875
Just be with me till that moment.

1284
01:47:28,583 --> 01:47:30,166
I'm fine if it lasts
even for a moment.

1285
01:47:32,083 --> 01:47:33,791
This moment is enough.

1286
01:47:53,416 --> 01:47:54,666
Tiger Nageswara Rao.

1287
01:47:55,791 --> 01:47:57,916
Nagi shot him and ran away.

1288
01:47:57,958 --> 01:48:00,166
Prepare shoot-at-sight
orders on his name.

1289
01:48:06,708 --> 01:48:08,583
- Bijli Prasad.
- What happened?

1290
01:48:08,708 --> 01:48:12,000
CI Mouli has found out
that Tiger's wife is over here.

1291
01:48:12,833 --> 01:48:13,583
What did you say?

1292
01:48:13,625 --> 01:48:15,333
He must be coming here.

1293
01:48:16,083 --> 01:48:18,875
Do one thing. Look for your
mother and get her here soon.

1294
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:19,833
You wait here.

1295
01:48:20,125 --> 01:48:23,500
Hey, Rajesh. Jagdish.
Everyone, come here.

1296
01:48:23,583 --> 01:48:25,125
Hey, Mariamma. Hey, Mariamma.

1297
01:48:25,208 --> 01:48:26,250
- Yes, Uncle.
- Come here.

1298
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:28,125
Hey, remove everything.

1299
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,083
Be careful.

1300
01:48:34,958 --> 01:48:36,875
Mani. You'll have to come out.

1301
01:48:36,958 --> 01:48:38,708
CI Mouli has found
out that you're here.

1302
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:43,750
We have to take her out.
Throw the ropes down.

1303
01:48:43,833 --> 01:48:44,708
Yes, come on.

1304
01:48:45,583 --> 01:48:46,833
Hey! Hold it.

1305
01:48:47,125 --> 01:48:48,208
Hold it tightly.

1306
01:48:48,708 --> 01:48:51,375
- Be careful.
- Ah!

1307
01:48:51,458 --> 01:48:54,125
Be very careful. Don't leave it.

1308
01:48:54,375 --> 01:48:55,500
- Ah!
- That's it.

1309
01:48:56,083 --> 01:48:58,708
Hurry up. We must hide
her before the cops arrive.

1310
01:48:59,958 --> 01:49:01,583
- Hurry up.
- Hey, you keep watch at the back.

1311
01:49:01,625 --> 01:49:02,625
She has started to have pains.

1312
01:49:02,708 --> 01:49:04,250
Don't worry. Nothing
will happen to her.

1313
01:49:14,916 --> 01:49:16,791
Sir, let her go.

1314
01:49:16,916 --> 01:49:18,791
Untie her hands.

1315
01:49:19,958 --> 01:49:21,791
Sir... Sir, leave her.

1316
01:49:23,041 --> 01:49:25,333
What kind of monster are you?

1317
01:49:25,416 --> 01:49:26,416
Leave her.

1318
01:49:26,541 --> 01:49:28,416
Don't commit this atrocity.

1319
01:49:28,541 --> 01:49:30,458
Sir, I beg of you.

1320
01:49:30,541 --> 01:49:31,458
- Sir.
- Ah!

1321
01:49:31,541 --> 01:49:33,916
Sir, please.

1322
01:49:34,041 --> 01:49:34,833
Please.

1323
01:49:35,166 --> 01:49:37,666
Let her go, sir.

1324
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,875
Don't do this, sir.

1325
01:49:41,208 --> 01:49:42,958
Sir, please.

1326
01:49:58,416 --> 01:50:01,666
Madam. Madam. Madam.

1327
01:50:02,208 --> 01:50:07,083
Look at him. He is
torturing a pregnant woman.

1328
01:50:13,166 --> 01:50:16,541
I don't know if your
mother is alive or not.

1329
01:50:17,083 --> 01:50:21,708
But she would have taken her own
life, if she had seen you doing this.

1330
01:50:23,125 --> 01:50:26,083
I have lost trust in God
because of people like you.

1331
01:50:33,041 --> 01:50:35,291
She is suffering from pain.

1332
01:50:36,083 --> 01:50:37,333
Why are you screaming about it?

1333
01:50:39,666 --> 01:50:40,625
Get out of here.

1334
01:50:43,125 --> 01:50:45,416
It's written in history books

1335
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:47,666
that before the independence,

1336
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:51,750
the Britishers didn't oppress us
with their weapons and army.

1337
01:50:51,875 --> 01:50:54,291
It happened because
of the fear within us.

1338
01:50:54,666 --> 01:50:56,166
But history has witnessed

1339
01:50:56,541 --> 01:50:58,833
that when we fought
against them together,

1340
01:50:59,250 --> 01:51:01,625
they had to bow
down in front of us.

1341
01:51:04,541 --> 01:51:09,291
He'll lose his power to torment
once you stop fearing him.

1342
01:51:11,541 --> 01:51:13,250
He'll bow down in
front of you as well.

1343
01:51:14,625 --> 01:51:17,500
Are you trying to
provoke these people?

1344
01:51:18,916 --> 01:51:22,000
I'm making them realise
that they need not fear the gun.

1345
01:51:22,333 --> 01:51:23,833
After you run out
of your six bullets,

1346
01:51:23,875 --> 01:51:26,500
have you thought about
what they will do to you?

1347
01:51:28,291 --> 01:51:30,750
I'll take the first bullet.

1348
01:51:31,291 --> 01:51:32,875
I'll take the second one.

1349
01:51:34,291 --> 01:51:35,875
I'll take the third one.

1350
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:37,500
I'll take the fourth.

1351
01:51:40,166 --> 01:51:42,166
You just wasted one bullet,
you scoundrel!

1352
01:51:42,375 --> 01:51:43,125
I'll take the fourth.

1353
01:51:43,166 --> 01:51:46,625
- We'll take it.
- We'll take it.

1354
01:51:46,666 --> 01:51:49,250
Sir, things are getting out of hand.
Let's go from here.

1355
01:51:49,291 --> 01:51:51,375
- We'll take it.
- We'll take it.

1356
01:51:51,416 --> 01:51:53,291
Everyone, let's get out of here.

1357
01:51:53,625 --> 01:51:56,500
- Let's go from here.
- Nagi! Nagi!

1358
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:58,125
- Let's take Mani inside quickly.
- Nagi! Nagi!

1359
01:51:58,166 --> 01:52:00,250
- Be careful.
- Pick her up quickly.

1360
01:52:00,416 --> 01:52:02,041
- Hurry up.
- Be careful.

1361
01:52:02,791 --> 01:52:05,000
- Come on. Be careful.
- Let's go.

1362
01:52:06,583 --> 01:52:08,375
Brother, who is this woman?

1363
01:52:08,875 --> 01:52:10,708
She is Mrs Hemalatha.

1364
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
All the progress that
our village has seen,

1365
01:52:13,083 --> 01:52:17,833
It was all possible from the moment,
she entered our village.

1366
01:52:18,708 --> 01:52:20,458
She is a social worker.

1367
01:52:20,833 --> 01:52:24,375
Just like Nageswara, she wants
to bring changes in Stuartpuram.

1368
01:52:25,125 --> 01:52:26,458
But without violence.

1369
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,458
She met Nageswara a few days ago.

1370
01:52:30,375 --> 01:52:31,208
Then she...

1371
01:52:31,583 --> 01:52:34,458
Nagi. She is Mrs Hemalatha.

1372
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:38,000
She wants to change
the condition of the village.

1373
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:41,583
- Like you, she also... - What's her
real intention of coming here?

1374
01:52:42,208 --> 01:52:47,458
You'll be able to change the village
when you change yourself, Nagi.

1375
01:52:48,708 --> 01:52:50,875
Change always starts with us.

1376
01:52:51,708 --> 01:52:55,208
I'll fulfil your dream, but
by walking the right path.

1377
01:52:55,625 --> 01:52:58,083
I'll start the factory
for the villagers.

1378
01:52:58,375 --> 01:52:59,958
You just have to surrender.

1379
01:53:04,958 --> 01:53:09,208
You're wondering, where will I get
the money for the factory, right?

1380
01:53:10,833 --> 01:53:14,208
I know someone who'll give us
money in the form of donations.

1381
01:53:14,958 --> 01:53:16,958
Well, you'll get the money.

1382
01:53:17,833 --> 01:53:19,583
But the permission
to start the factory

1383
01:53:20,958 --> 01:53:22,333
will never be given by Yelamanda.

1384
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:24,750
He'll create obstacles in your path.

1385
01:53:25,083 --> 01:53:28,083
If he does, Madam will go
to politicians superior to him.

1386
01:53:28,583 --> 01:53:29,458
But what would you do?

1387
01:53:29,833 --> 01:53:31,833
Everyone hates our village.

1388
01:53:32,208 --> 01:53:34,291
We are like animals to them.

1389
01:53:36,083 --> 01:53:38,208
When no one is
listening to your problems,

1390
01:53:38,333 --> 01:53:39,708
you become a problem yourself.

1391
01:53:40,083 --> 01:53:43,750
Do you think that I won't
be able to set up a factory?

1392
01:53:43,958 --> 01:53:45,458
I don't doubt it. That's the truth.

1393
01:53:45,708 --> 01:53:48,208
Would you surrender if I'm
successful in setting up a factory?

1394
01:53:48,458 --> 01:53:51,875
I'll get arrested the day
the factory is inaugurated.

1395
01:53:52,333 --> 01:53:53,333
Fine.

1396
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:56,500
Madam.

1397
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,208
I haven't finished talking.

1398
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:03,333
You didn't tell me what
I'll get in case I win.

1399
01:54:03,375 --> 01:54:06,458
- What do you want?
- I'll tell you the day I win.

1400
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:08,333
You're making a mistake, Nagi.

1401
01:54:08,958 --> 01:54:11,708
For the first time, I
wish for you to lose.

1402
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:19,958
Until I change the
condition of Stuartpuram,

1403
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:23,500
I'll live with you in this village.

1404
01:54:24,875 --> 01:54:27,708
- The village needs proper roads.
- 'Namaste.' - 'Namaste.'

1405
01:54:32,083 --> 01:54:33,708
We want the
development of the village.

1406
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:36,000
Electricity is necessary for that.

1407
01:54:36,125 --> 01:54:37,000
- 'Namaste.
- Namaste.'

1408
01:54:48,208 --> 01:54:50,083
Here. Do it like this.

1409
01:54:55,458 --> 01:54:57,708
You all were working
in different states.

1410
01:54:58,333 --> 01:55:01,750
There's a reason that you have been
called from different departments.

1411
01:55:03,583 --> 01:55:05,458
Nageswara Rao.

1412
01:55:06,333 --> 01:55:10,625
He remains alert even
when he is asleep.

1413
01:55:12,708 --> 01:55:13,958
His special men,

1414
01:55:14,208 --> 01:55:16,125
Yaari, Mari,

1415
01:55:16,583 --> 01:55:18,958
Jaya Rao, Suryam,

1416
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:21,833
Veera... Come on, boys.

1417
01:55:22,958 --> 01:55:24,708
Let's get charged.

1418
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,750
He is killing our
people one by one.

1419
01:55:53,083 --> 01:55:54,875
The next turn is ours.

1420
01:55:55,125 --> 01:55:56,875
Do something, Nagi. Do something.

1421
01:55:57,208 --> 01:55:59,958
Madam has submitted a
new application for the factory.

1422
01:56:00,208 --> 01:56:03,333
But till Yelamanda is there,
he won't permit the application.

1423
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,833
I need to write a
letter to someone.

1424
01:56:07,208 --> 01:56:08,250
Letter to whom?

1425
01:56:09,208 --> 01:56:10,500
To the Prime Minister.

1426
01:56:10,833 --> 01:56:13,958
He gets many letters
daily from people.

1427
01:56:14,333 --> 01:56:15,958
Why would he focus on our letter?

1428
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,583
Because we won't go
to him with our problems.

1429
01:56:18,833 --> 01:56:20,583
But we'll give him such problems,

1430
01:56:20,833 --> 01:56:23,083
that he'll be forced
to listen to us.

1431
01:56:25,958 --> 01:56:31,500
'Tiger wrote a letter to the PM
that she is going to rob his house.'

1432
01:56:33,208 --> 01:56:35,333
Ah!

1433
01:56:53,458 --> 01:56:55,208
I've understood the problem.

1434
01:56:56,083 --> 01:56:57,500
Now, I'll bring the solution.

1435
01:57:12,166 --> 01:57:13,666
Let me go, Nagi.

1436
01:57:14,083 --> 01:57:15,916
I'll tell you where the gold is.

1437
01:57:16,208 --> 01:57:20,375
It is kept in locker number
26 of the Bangapur Bank.

1438
01:57:20,666 --> 01:57:22,208
If you want gold,

1439
01:57:22,291 --> 01:57:24,041
you'll have to steal
it from the bank.

1440
01:57:24,166 --> 01:57:25,083
There's no other option.

1441
01:57:25,166 --> 01:57:27,458
Nagi, Mani is here.

1442
01:58:08,333 --> 01:58:10,333
I brought your
favourite fish curry.

1443
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:14,250
You eat it. Then we'll go.

1444
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:15,583
Where will we go?

1445
01:58:15,625 --> 01:58:17,875
We have the
permission for the factory.

1446
01:58:18,208 --> 01:58:19,583
Tomorrow is the inauguration.

1447
01:58:19,708 --> 01:58:20,625
So what?

1448
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:25,208
You said that you would surrender
once the factory is started.

1449
01:58:27,250 --> 01:58:29,958
Everyone is waiting for you there.

1450
01:58:31,458 --> 01:58:32,500
Let's go, Nagi.

1451
01:58:33,166 --> 01:58:34,250
I won't come.

1452
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,083
Why not?

1453
01:58:38,583 --> 01:58:40,416
Because I have things to do.

1454
01:58:40,625 --> 01:58:41,708
You leave.

1455
01:58:45,375 --> 01:58:48,458
Hey, Yaari. Drop her home.

1456
01:58:48,708 --> 01:58:51,333
Where? Are you going to rob again?

1457
01:58:53,833 --> 01:58:57,708
Madam promised that you would not
face any danger if you surrender.

1458
01:59:01,291 --> 01:59:04,000
What will happen to me and
them if something happens to you?

1459
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,250
Have you ever thought about it?

1460
01:59:06,583 --> 01:59:08,041
No harm would come to them.

1461
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:09,791
Their father is here.

1462
01:59:09,916 --> 01:59:13,583
They were always with
you. Maari, Veera, Surya...

1463
01:59:13,666 --> 01:59:14,541
You couldn't save them.

1464
01:59:14,666 --> 01:59:16,708
How will you save us when
we'll be far away from you?

1465
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:20,041
I know in which
bank the gold is in.

1466
01:59:20,291 --> 01:59:22,291
I need to get the
gold out of there.

1467
01:59:22,333 --> 01:59:25,541
No one will be able to
understand what I'm doing.

1468
01:59:25,583 --> 01:59:28,458
But it's not about you today. It's
about the children's happiness.

1469
01:59:29,541 --> 01:59:30,791
Take care of them, Mani.

1470
01:59:31,375 --> 01:59:32,541
Go now.

1471
01:59:32,791 --> 01:59:33,875
Yaari.

1472
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:52,916
Mom, she is here.

1473
02:00:12,208 --> 02:00:14,833
Mani, did Nageswara Rao refuse?

1474
02:00:19,625 --> 02:00:22,333
Nagi just lost the final
opportunity to remain alive.

1475
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,375
No one can save him now.

1476
02:00:25,458 --> 02:00:26,750
Just shoot him when you see him.

1477
02:00:26,875 --> 02:00:28,208
Search the entire forest.

1478
02:00:28,458 --> 02:00:29,333
It's not needed.

1479
02:00:29,583 --> 02:00:31,583
I will tell you where
Nageswara Rao is.

1480
02:00:32,125 --> 02:00:34,333
- Don't do it, Mani.
- Wait, brother.

1481
02:00:35,583 --> 02:00:37,458
I'll tell you everything you want.

1482
02:00:38,125 --> 02:00:40,333
But you must oblige my request, too.

1483
02:00:42,208 --> 02:00:43,083
What do you want?

1484
02:00:45,375 --> 02:00:50,583
You must take back the
shoot-at-sight orders on Nagi.

1485
02:00:51,625 --> 02:00:52,708
Alright.

1486
02:00:53,083 --> 02:00:54,000
Mani.

1487
02:00:54,083 --> 02:00:57,250
Getting arrested in the forest
and surrendering to Madam

1488
02:00:57,625 --> 02:01:00,125
are completely different
things. Mouli can do anything.

1489
02:01:01,333 --> 02:01:02,250
Mani.

1490
02:01:02,875 --> 02:01:05,208
The SP has given a
word to you before me.

1491
02:01:05,625 --> 02:01:07,833
Tell us where Nagi is hiding.

1492
02:01:10,583 --> 02:01:12,625
Tell us where Nageswara
Rao is hiding quickly.

1493
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:22,875
How will you save him?

1494
02:01:24,208 --> 02:01:25,750
Uncle is here.

1495
02:01:28,083 --> 02:01:29,125
- Hey, Mahesh.
- Yeah.

1496
02:01:29,583 --> 02:01:30,458
What's happening?

1497
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:32,500
It seems Nagi went to
rob the Bangapur Bank.

1498
02:01:32,583 --> 02:01:34,458
And the cops went to catch him.

1499
02:01:35,208 --> 02:01:36,583
Who informed the cops?

1500
02:01:36,708 --> 02:01:38,000
You will be shocked to hear it.

1501
02:01:38,083 --> 02:01:39,958
His wife informed them.

1502
02:01:45,458 --> 02:01:47,458
What did you do, Mani?

1503
02:01:49,791 --> 02:01:51,875
We have to send gold to Kolkata.

1504
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,666
You know what you have to do next.

1505
02:03:50,458 --> 02:03:53,583
While Nagi robs banks
and enjoys that money,

1506
02:03:53,875 --> 02:03:56,583
the police punish our
children for his crimes.

1507
02:03:58,208 --> 02:04:02,333
Why does he need to rob when
everything is fine in the village?

1508
02:04:02,625 --> 02:04:04,958
We thought that he
did all of this for us.

1509
02:04:04,958 --> 02:04:06,958
But everything has been a lie.

1510
02:04:08,208 --> 02:04:11,458
No matter how many rivers
we pour water into the sea,

1511
02:04:12,208 --> 02:04:15,000
the seawater remains salty.

1512
02:04:17,375 --> 02:04:19,875
No matter how well
people like you are treated,

1513
02:04:20,458 --> 02:04:22,958
your minds think negatively.

1514
02:04:26,333 --> 02:04:29,333
What do you people even
know about him? Huh?

1515
02:04:29,875 --> 02:04:34,250
He has committed
thefts in running trains.

1516
02:04:36,833 --> 02:04:40,625
Three hundred guards...
14 feet of walls...

1517
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:43,333
None could stop him.

1518
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:52,000
Nagi even reached the Prime
Minister's place as a challenge.

1519
02:04:53,708 --> 02:04:57,958
He can easily make the world
bow to him if he wants to rule them.

1520
02:05:27,291 --> 02:05:28,291
We accept it.

1521
02:05:28,333 --> 02:05:30,791
We accept everything
that you've said about Nagi.

1522
02:05:30,833 --> 02:05:34,416
But would the police have
tormented us if he had surrendered?

1523
02:05:34,416 --> 02:05:38,666
The villages have roads, electricity
and the factory because of madam.

1524
02:05:38,916 --> 02:05:40,666
That monster deceived her as well.

1525
02:05:40,708 --> 02:05:41,791
Madam worked hard

1526
02:05:41,916 --> 02:05:45,041
but it wasn't her application
that got electricity in the village.

1527
02:05:45,916 --> 02:05:49,458
If Nagi hadn't run in the dark lanes
of the village, risking his life,

1528
02:05:50,083 --> 02:05:51,541
there would've been no electricity.

1529
02:05:51,541 --> 02:05:54,583
He deliberately made the
police run after him in the dark.

1530
02:05:54,666 --> 02:05:56,166
He takes advantage of the darkness.

1531
02:05:56,416 --> 02:05:58,416
We'll catch him if there's
electricity in the village.

1532
02:05:58,541 --> 02:06:01,708
He forced the police officers to
get the electricity for the village.

1533
02:06:08,041 --> 02:06:10,208
When he made the police
officers run on sandy roads

1534
02:06:10,291 --> 02:06:12,291
and wounded himself deliberately,

1535
02:06:12,416 --> 02:06:14,666
that's when you got proper roads.

1536
02:06:16,666 --> 02:06:19,041
The tyres get stuck when we
chase him with our vehicles.

1537
02:06:19,083 --> 02:06:20,916
And we can't run
like him in the sand.

1538
02:06:20,958 --> 02:06:23,291
We need proper roads to chase him.

1539
02:06:23,708 --> 02:06:28,166
The roads wouldn't have been built
if he hadn't spilt his own blood.

1540
02:06:31,041 --> 02:06:33,166
Then why did he challenge
me to build a factory?

1541
02:06:33,291 --> 02:06:35,291
Challenging Mrs Hemalatha Lavanam

1542
02:06:36,166 --> 02:06:39,541
and making a factory
through her was his first step.

1543
02:06:40,541 --> 02:06:43,583
It was because, his own money
was from robbery and was illegal.

1544
02:06:44,125 --> 02:06:45,875
So, through Angee Seth,

1545
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:50,416
he helped that money reach
Hemalatha in the form of donations.

1546
02:06:50,416 --> 02:06:51,833
This was his second plan.

1547
02:06:51,916 --> 02:06:54,583
Please remember me
if there's any work for me.

1548
02:06:54,791 --> 02:06:56,791
'My name is Angi Seth.'

1549
02:06:57,041 --> 02:06:59,041
Nageswara Rao will make sure

1550
02:06:59,458 --> 02:07:02,833
you get the donation money
via Angi Seth.

1551
02:07:03,833 --> 02:07:06,333
The law has started accepting.

1552
02:07:06,583 --> 02:07:08,541
Nageswara's traps because of you.

1553
02:07:09,666 --> 02:07:11,916
That is why he kept the condition

1554
02:07:11,958 --> 02:07:14,458
so that you fulfil this task.

1555
02:07:19,041 --> 02:07:22,416
'Ah!'

1556
02:07:46,291 --> 02:07:49,500
'Nageswara, you've been
with me since childhood.'

1557
02:07:51,791 --> 02:07:54,541
'But I am
leaving you today, friend.'

1558
02:08:01,166 --> 02:08:05,125
He would've not become the police's
fodder if he had been selfish.

1559
02:08:05,875 --> 02:08:07,000
Neither would he live
in a worse condition

1560
02:08:07,125 --> 02:08:08,166
than animals in the forest.

1561
02:09:24,166 --> 02:09:27,625
He didn't go to steal people's
money in the Bangapur Bank.

1562
02:09:28,291 --> 02:09:31,916
He is going to steal
Yelamanda's gold from his locker

1563
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:33,750
and give it to Angi Seth.

1564
02:09:33,750 --> 02:09:35,625
'He is bleeding so much.
Driver, call the doctor.'

1565
02:09:35,625 --> 02:09:39,708
'Seth, bullets couldn't harm me
since childhood.'

1566
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,000
'Convert this gold into money
and give it to Madam.'

1567
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:51,000
Madam Prime Minister.

1568
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:56,750
Nageswara Rao has planned his final
move before starting the game.

1569
02:09:58,125 --> 02:09:59,625
There is a system exploiting
the helplessness

1570
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:01,416
of the people of Stuartpuram,

1571
02:10:01,708 --> 02:10:04,250
including politicians,
police, and bureaucrats.

1572
02:10:05,166 --> 02:10:07,000
Despite all this,

1573
02:10:07,125 --> 02:10:11,250
Nageswara Rao devised
a grand scheme to build a factory.

1574
02:10:11,958 --> 02:10:15,875
Robbing your house was
a small part of that scheme.

1575
02:10:17,625 --> 02:10:19,500
He knows that we
wouldn't care about

1576
02:10:19,541 --> 02:10:22,000
the village if
we received applications.

1577
02:10:22,291 --> 02:10:25,375
So, what did he do?
He deliberately caused trouble

1578
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:28,750
by making us visit Stuartpuram
and discover the issue ourselves.

1579
02:10:30,125 --> 02:10:33,500
Madam Prime Minister,
this is the note he left for me.

1580
02:10:40,875 --> 02:10:42,708
He knew that I would come there.

1581
02:10:43,458 --> 02:10:46,458
He even knows that I came.

1582
02:10:47,083 --> 02:10:48,875
Lord Krishna
has mentioned in the Gita

1583
02:10:49,208 --> 02:10:52,125
 'Selfless work
is a strong deed.'

1584
02:10:52,375 --> 02:10:53,708
That action can
neither be good nor bad.

1585
02:10:53,833 --> 02:10:55,958
Neither is it a sin nor
a virtue. It is nothing.

1586
02:10:56,083 --> 02:10:58,583
If the cops catch Nageswara Rao,

1587
02:10:58,708 --> 02:11:00,875
I will fight in the court for him.

1588
02:11:01,916 --> 02:11:05,458
I will get him out with
a lesser punishment myself.

1589
02:11:11,916 --> 02:11:14,500
I came wherever you asked me to
and did whatever you told me to.

1590
02:11:14,666 --> 02:11:16,416
That's because you are
from Nageswara's gang.

1591
02:11:16,625 --> 02:11:19,000
But you've never shown me
a glimpse of Nageswara Rao.

1592
02:11:19,250 --> 02:11:20,500
- Shh!
- What happened?

1593
02:11:25,291 --> 02:11:27,000
- Come.
- Hey, who is it?

1594
02:11:27,041 --> 02:11:28,250
- Come.
- What is it? What happened?

1595
02:11:28,375 --> 02:11:30,125
I've caught the police informer

1596
02:11:30,166 --> 02:11:31,625
who killed Nageswara Rao's people.

1597
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:33,750
- I'll kill him myself, then.
- Hey! Wait.

1598
02:11:34,875 --> 02:11:37,625
Nageswara Rao will kill him.

1599
02:11:38,125 --> 02:11:39,375
Will Nageswara Rao come?

1600
02:11:39,750 --> 02:11:41,750
- You will meet Nageswara Rao today.
- Really?

1601
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,291
You tie up the informer.

1602
02:11:43,375 --> 02:11:46,791
- I will get Nageswara.
- Alright.

1603
02:12:25,916 --> 02:12:27,833
Are you waiting for Nageswara Rao?

1604
02:12:28,208 --> 02:12:31,458
Didn't I promise you that I would
kill him after showing him to you?

1605
02:12:31,708 --> 02:12:33,458
He is Nageswara Rao.

1606
02:12:38,041 --> 02:12:39,166
Huh?

1607
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:46,125
No, let him go, Sir.

1608
02:12:46,416 --> 02:12:48,708
No! Ah!

1609
02:12:49,041 --> 02:12:50,791
Ah!

1610
02:12:50,916 --> 02:12:53,791
No, Sir. Let him go.

1611
02:12:59,958 --> 02:13:02,041
'Sir, don't worry.'

1612
02:13:02,166 --> 02:13:03,666
'I will get Nageswara to you.'

1613
02:13:08,958 --> 02:13:09,958
Madam.

1614
02:13:11,791 --> 02:13:13,333
Madam!

1615
02:13:13,416 --> 02:13:15,083
Mouli has taken
Nageswara Rao to the factory.

1616
02:13:15,166 --> 02:13:17,583
Please save him!

1617
02:13:19,166 --> 02:13:20,458
I beg you.

1618
02:13:22,041 --> 02:13:24,041
- Let's go quickly.
- Run.

1619
02:13:24,083 --> 02:13:26,291
- Let's go.
- We must save him.

1620
02:13:39,666 --> 02:13:44,916
What is this? You've tied up
a tiger like a pet.

1621
02:13:45,958 --> 02:13:50,208
Oh, no! He is bleeding.

1622
02:13:51,791 --> 02:13:53,708
You killed my brother.

1623
02:13:54,208 --> 02:13:56,708
You stabbed me with the axe.

1624
02:13:56,916 --> 02:13:59,291
But you are still breathing.

1625
02:14:00,333 --> 02:14:01,833
Do you know why?

1626
02:14:04,708 --> 02:14:06,291
Upon slitting the neck,

1627
02:14:06,416 --> 02:14:08,708
a person dies once and for all.

1628
02:14:11,125 --> 02:14:13,750
But when you shatter his dreams,

1629
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,750
he dies every day.

1630
02:14:17,166 --> 02:14:20,666
Sir, shatter his dream

1631
02:14:21,291 --> 02:14:22,875
of changing Stuartpuram.

1632
02:14:23,541 --> 02:14:25,416
I will kill him.

1633
02:14:30,708 --> 02:14:32,958
I've made arrangements

1634
02:14:33,791 --> 02:14:35,791
to close your factory.

1635
02:14:36,041 --> 02:14:39,083
Yesterday, we met Hyderabad's CM.

1636
02:14:39,791 --> 02:14:41,291
He told me,

1637
02:14:41,333 --> 02:14:43,666
'I don't want to disgrace
myself by supporting'

1638
02:14:43,708 --> 02:14:45,916
'a disgraceful village
like Stuartpuram.'

1639
02:14:46,458 --> 02:14:48,083
'Permission cancelled.'

1640
02:14:49,708 --> 02:14:55,041
After killing you, I will snatch
your village's dream of education.

1641
02:14:55,083 --> 02:14:58,583
I will show them their place again.

1642
02:15:05,833 --> 02:15:07,958
Sir, there's a call
from the party office.

1643
02:15:16,541 --> 02:15:18,333
'I don't understand
what's happening here.'

1644
02:15:18,541 --> 02:15:20,416
'You have been dismissed
from your post of MLA.'

1645
02:15:20,666 --> 02:15:22,541
'You've been dismissed
from the party, as well.'

1646
02:15:22,666 --> 02:15:25,291
The factory you wanted to stop,

1647
02:15:25,541 --> 02:15:28,666
the Central Minister will lay
its foundation tomorrow.

1648
02:15:30,583 --> 02:15:32,916
Hey! What are you blabbering?

1649
02:15:33,166 --> 02:15:36,166
I met the CM yesterday. I got
the permission cancellation order.

1650
02:15:36,416 --> 02:15:38,708
'Do you know where the order
of building the factory came from?'

1651
02:15:38,791 --> 02:15:39,833
The Prime Minister!

1652
02:15:40,541 --> 02:15:43,166
Nageswara Rao's way was wrong.

1653
02:15:43,208 --> 02:15:45,916
But his intentions were pure.
Any soldier would do

1654
02:15:45,958 --> 02:15:48,291
what he did to save

1655
02:15:48,416 --> 02:15:49,916
his motherland.

1656
02:15:50,166 --> 02:15:52,541
That's why Nageswara Rao
is not a criminal.

1657
02:15:52,833 --> 02:15:54,333
He is a revolutionary.

1658
02:16:03,791 --> 02:16:08,958
You met the CM,
but I met the PM, Yelamanda.

1659
02:16:15,541 --> 02:16:17,166
You are fortunate.

1660
02:16:17,541 --> 02:16:22,291
I won't leave you to die every day
after butchering your dream.

1661
02:16:22,666 --> 02:16:26,458
Instead, I will behead you
according to my promise.

1662
02:16:26,666 --> 02:16:29,958
I won't spare anyone. I will turn
the whole Stuartpuram to ashes.

1663
02:16:30,041 --> 02:16:31,791
Shoot him with all you have.

1664
02:16:54,208 --> 02:16:58,291
I am not a pet that you can chain.

1665
02:16:58,541 --> 02:17:00,041
I am Tiger.

1666
02:17:42,708 --> 02:17:44,041
Hey!

1667
02:17:45,333 --> 02:17:47,666
Ah!

1668
02:17:56,166 --> 02:18:00,958
Ah!

1669
02:18:06,166 --> 02:18:11,083
Argh!

1670
02:18:17,666 --> 02:18:21,416
Argh!

1671
02:18:28,416 --> 02:18:31,458
You turned peaceful
forest dwellers into thieves.

1672
02:18:35,041 --> 02:18:37,916
You used us for your selfish needs.

1673
02:18:37,958 --> 02:18:40,666
You didn't give us a chance
to educate ourselves.

1674
02:18:40,708 --> 02:18:43,291
Nor did you give us any jobs
if we were well-educated.

1675
02:18:46,916 --> 02:18:51,041
You also stopped
the factory's construction.

1676
02:18:53,166 --> 02:18:55,208
Argh!

1677
02:18:56,458 --> 02:18:59,291
You are the root cause
of our destruction.

1678
02:18:59,791 --> 02:19:03,041
I can die in peace
after uprooting you.

1679
02:19:03,666 --> 02:19:06,291
Today, our stories will end.

1680
02:19:06,541 --> 02:19:11,708
- Ah!
- Ah!

1681
02:19:25,458 --> 02:19:29,041
I am not leaving empty-handed.

1682
02:20:01,666 --> 02:20:03,166
Wait.

1683
02:20:03,208 --> 02:20:05,791
- Break it.
- Be quick. Break it.

1684
02:20:06,166 --> 02:20:07,583
Please save Nageswara.

1685
02:20:07,791 --> 02:20:10,708
Nageswara is here.

1686
02:20:10,791 --> 02:20:12,833
- Save him!
- Do it here.

1687
02:20:13,166 --> 02:20:14,583
They will kill him.

1688
02:20:14,833 --> 02:20:18,041
- Nageswara!
- Someone save Nageswara.

1689
02:20:18,916 --> 02:20:22,708
Nageswara, we are here.

1690
02:20:23,041 --> 02:20:24,916
Nageswara!

1691
02:20:24,958 --> 02:20:26,791
Nageswara!

1692
02:20:26,833 --> 02:20:29,291
Nageswara!

1693
02:20:29,541 --> 02:20:32,916
Nageswara, what happened?

1694
02:20:33,666 --> 02:20:35,833
What has happened?

1695
02:20:36,583 --> 02:20:38,541
Nageswara!

1696
02:20:38,666 --> 02:20:41,166
Nageswara, why aren't you talking?

1697
02:20:41,291 --> 02:20:44,041
Nageswara!

1698
02:20:44,291 --> 02:20:45,958
Nageswara!

1699
02:20:46,041 --> 02:20:48,333
Nageswara!

1700
02:20:48,416 --> 02:20:50,208
Nageswara!

1701
02:20:53,916 --> 02:20:57,625
You cannot leave us, Nageswara.

1702
02:20:58,166 --> 02:21:01,916
- Hey, Nageswara, what is this?
- Nageswara!

1703
02:21:02,458 --> 02:21:03,458
Uncle.

1704
02:21:03,708 --> 02:21:06,833
Nageswara, nothing
will happen to you!

1705
02:21:07,125 --> 02:21:09,750
Nageswara!

1706
02:21:09,791 --> 02:21:11,625
Nothing will
happen to you, Nageswara.

1707
02:21:11,875 --> 02:21:14,375
Nageswara! Someone, save him.

1708
02:21:15,625 --> 02:21:17,000
Nageswara.

1709
02:21:21,041 --> 02:21:22,416
You have won, Nageswara.

1710
02:21:22,833 --> 02:21:24,416
You helped us win this battle.

1711
02:21:24,791 --> 02:21:26,208
Madam, do you remember I said

1712
02:21:26,291 --> 02:21:28,208
I would ask for something if I win?

1713
02:21:28,791 --> 02:21:31,166
I might have done
a lot for the village.

1714
02:21:31,916 --> 02:21:34,583
But I did nothing
for my wife and children.

1715
02:21:35,791 --> 02:21:39,041
Their responsibility is yours.
Look after them.

1716
02:21:43,875 --> 02:21:46,666
Nageswara, nothing
will happen to you.

1717
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:49,500
Perhaps not in this life,

1718
02:21:50,083 --> 02:21:52,041
but I will be a better husband
in the next life.

1719
02:22:01,750 --> 02:22:05,166
Nageswara!

1720
02:22:10,041 --> 02:22:11,416
Nageswara!

1721
02:22:13,166 --> 02:22:15,500
Nageswara!

1722
02:22:34,250 --> 02:22:36,625
You did so much for us, son!

1723
02:23:04,791 --> 02:23:07,541
'You will also get caught
if I am caught.'

1724
02:23:07,625 --> 02:23:09,125
'If the money slips
out of our hands,'

1725
02:23:09,291 --> 02:23:10,916
'Yelamanda will exact his revenge'

1726
02:23:11,416 --> 02:23:13,666
'by starving our people.'

1727
02:23:14,291 --> 02:23:15,625
'Listen, Nageswara.'

1728
02:23:15,791 --> 02:23:20,375
'Remember one thing.
If one person's death can save a hundred,'

1729
02:23:20,750 --> 02:23:24,875
'there is no greater victory than
that. My death is my victory, son.'

1730
02:23:26,250 --> 02:23:29,666
'Don't think, son. Kill me!'

1731
02:23:32,416 --> 02:23:33,875
"Hey!"

1732
02:23:35,625 --> 02:23:40,333
'You waged a war for your people.
Your sacrifice won't go in vain.'

1733
02:23:40,708 --> 02:23:41,875
'Tiger Nageswara Rao,'

1734
02:23:42,208 --> 02:23:45,333
'your name will be remembered
till this village exists.'

1735
02:23:45,458 --> 02:23:48,208
'We won't belittle your sacrifice'

1736
02:23:48,375 --> 02:23:51,833
'with closed eyes.
You will live forever.'

1737
02:23:52,041 --> 02:23:53,666
'I salute to you.'

1738
02:23:55,416 --> 02:23:59,208
Our village looks so beautiful
from the top. Right?

1739
02:24:01,125 --> 02:24:03,166
Oh no! They rang
the bell. I must leave.

1740
02:24:03,250 --> 02:24:05,875
- Where are you going in a hurry?
- I am going to school.

1741
02:24:05,916 --> 02:24:09,166
You won't have to steal
if I am well-educated.
