1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,360
They are among the most terrifying of 
Sauron’s beasts. Great winged creatures,  

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:12,400
these hell-hawks would become the steed of choice 
for the Nazgul. Bearing their dark masters,  

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,720
they would bring terror from the skies.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,960
Today, on Nerd of the Rings, we 
cover the Fell Beasts of the Nazgul.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,520
While the Fell Beasts are mysterious 
creatures and we don’t know their exact  

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,200
origin, we are given clues. We know 
that, like his master before him,  

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,320
Sauron clearly saw the value of being capable 
of aerial battle, in addition to aerial travel.  

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,360
Where Morgoth would create the winged 
dragons that debut in the War of Wrath,  

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,800
Sauron brings about the fell beasts that 
would be revealed during the War of the Ring.

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,080
After a journey that began in secrecy,  

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,280
the ringwraiths' horses are killed when they 
are swept away by the River Bruinen. Forced  

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,680
to return to Mordor on foot, Sauron’s servants 
turn to their more speedy and deadly steeds.

13
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,080
The first appearance of a fell beast, though we 
don’t know it at the time, is on the night of  

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,360
February 23, when the fellowship is making its way 
down the Anduin river after their stay in Lorien.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,320
[A] dark shape, like a cloud and yet not 
a cloud, for it moved far more swiftly,  

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,640
came out of the blackness in the South, and sped 
towards the Company, blotting out all light as  

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,680
it approached. Soon it appeared as a great winged 
creature, blacker than the pits in the night....

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,000
Suddenly the great bow of Lórien sang. Shrill went 
the arrow from the elven-string. Frodo looked up.  

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,280
Almost above him the winged shape swerved. 
There was a harsh croaking scream,  

20
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,920
as it fell out of the air, vanishing down into 
the gloom of the eastern shore. The sky was  

21
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,320
clean again. There was a tumult of many voices 
far away, cursing and wailing in the darkness,  

22
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,560
and then silence. Neither shaft nor cry 
came again from the east that night.

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,200
It is not until chapter 3 of the The Two Towers 
that we get a hint that Legolas had indeed shot  

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,280
down the mount of a Nazgul, and that these beasts 
were far greater than mere means of travel.

25
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:34,240
UGLUK: What's happened to your precious Nazgûl? 
Has he had another mount shot under him? Now,  

26
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,800
if you'd brought him along, that might have been 
useful-if these Nazgûl are all they make out.’

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,720
‘Nazgûl, Nazgûl,’ said Grishnákh, 
shivering and licking his lips,  

28
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,960
as if the word had a foul taste that he savoured 
painfully. ‘You speak of what is deep beyond the  

29
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:03,680
reach of your muddy dreams, Uglúk,’ he said. 
‘Nazgûl! Ah! All that they make out! One day  

30
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,520
you'll wish that you had not said that. Ape!’ he 
snarled fiercely. 'You ought to know that they're  

31
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:18,320
the apple of the Great Eye. But the winged 
Nazgûl: not yet, not yet. He won't let them  

32
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:27,440
show themselves across the Great River yet, not 
too soon. They're for the War-and other purposes.’

33
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,480
Two chapters later, Gandalf would confirm to 
Legolas directly the victim of his shot and  

34
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,280
that the Nazgul would no longer resort 
to mere horses in the War of the Ring…

35
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,240
'The Winged Messenger!' cried Legolas. 'I shot at 
him with the bow of Galadriel above Sarn Gebir,  

36
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,000
and I felled him from the sky. He filled 
us all with fear. What new terror is this?'

37
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
'One that you cannot slay with arrows,'  

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:04,000
said Gandalf. 'You only slew his steed. It was a 
good deed; but the Rider was soon horsed again.  

39
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:12,000
For he was a Nazgûl, one of the Nine, 
who ride now upon winged steeds.

40
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,280
Chronologically, Frodo, Sam and 
Gollum are next to experience  

41
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,760
a nazgul on its fell steed as they 
pass through the Dead Marshes:

42
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,200
Then Frodo and Sam staring at the sky..., saw 
it come: a small cloud flying from the accursed  

43
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:37,920
hills; a black shadow loosed from Mordor; 
a vast shape winged and ominous. It scudded  

44
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:46,400
across the moon, and with a deadly cry went away 
westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed.

45
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,120
They fell forward, grovelling heedlessly on the 
cold earth. But the shadow of horror wheeled and  

46
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:01,440
returned, passing lower now, right above them, 
sweeping the fen-reek with its ghastly wings.  

47
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,240
And then it was gone, flying back to Mordor 
with the speed of the wrath of Sauron;  

48
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,560
and behind it the wind roared away, 
leaving the Dead Marshes bare and bleak.

49
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,440
Frodo and Sam got up.... But Gollum lay on the 
ground as if he had been stunned. They roused him  

50
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,680
with difficulty, and for some time he would not 
lift his face, but knelt forward on his elbows,  

51
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,800
covering the back of his head 
with his large flat hands.

52
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,520
'Wraiths!' he wailed. 'Wraiths on wings!  

53
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,920
The Precious is their master. 
They see everything, everything.  

54
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:54,240
Nothing can hide from them. Curse the White Face! 
And they tell Him everything. He sees, He knows.  

55
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,311
Ach, gollum, gollum, gollum!'

56
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:06,000
Again, they experience a winged Nazgul, 
but this time it was on other business…

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,080
[Frodo, Sam, and Gollum] had not gone far before 
they felt once more the fear that had fallen on  

58
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:19,920
them when the winged shape swept over the marshes. 
They halted, cowering on the evil-smelling ground;  

59
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:26,960
but... the menace passed, high overhead, going 
maybe on some swift errand from Barad-dûr.

60
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,240
Gandalf and the three hunters would go on to 
assist the Rohirrim in the Battle of Helm’s Deep  

61
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,440
and then come to Isengard to parley with Saruman. 
However, on their way back to Edoras, they would  

62
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:46,640
once again feel the dread of the Winged Nazgul. 
While reading the book, this comes before Sam and  

63
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,280
Frodo’s moment, we discover that this is actually 
the same Nazgul making his way to Isengard.

64
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,520
At that moment a shadow fell over them. The 
bright moonlight seemed to be suddenly cut off.  

65
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,400
Several of the Riders cried out, and crouched, 
holding their arms above their heads, as if to  

66
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:14,240
ward off a blow from above: a blind fear and a 
deadly cold fell on them. Cowering they looked  

67
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:22,800
up. A vast winged shape passed over the moon like 
a black cloud. It wheeled and went north, flying  

68
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,840
at a speed greater than any wind of Middle-earth. 
The stars fainted before it. It was gone.

69
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,720
Gandalf would face off against 
what Beregond of Gondor calls  

70
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,840
“hell-hawks” as Faramir is making 
his escape back to Minas Tirith.

71
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,440
But now the dark swooping shadows were aware 
of the newcomer. One wheeled towards him;  

72
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,560
but... he raised his hand, and from it 
a shaft of white light stabbed upwards.  

73
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,480
The Nazgûl gave a long wailing cry and swerved 
away; and with that the four others wavered,  

74
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,040
and then rising in swift spirals 
they passed away eastward  

75
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:10,080
vanishing into the lowering cloud above; and down 
on the Pelennor it seemed for a while less dark.

76
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,280
The fell beasts we meet in The Lord of the Rings 
have beaks and claws. They are featherless and  

77
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,760
have bat-like wings, it is hinted that their 
heads are somewhat bird-like. The most physical  

78
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,640
description we get of these winged monstrosities 
comes later in The Return of the King…

79
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:37,040
The great shadow descended like a falling cloud. 
And behold! it was a winged creature: if bird,  

80
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,920
then greater than all other birds, and it was 
naked, and neither quill nor feather did it bear,  

81
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,920
and its vast pinions were as webs of hide 
between horned fingers; and it stank.  

82
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,200
A creature of an older world maybe it was, 
whose kind, lingering in forgotten mountains  

83
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:06,160
cold beneath the Moon, outstayed their day, and in 
hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brood, apt  

84
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,640
to evil. And the Dark Lord took it, and nursed 
it with fell meats, until it grew beyond the  

85
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,880
measure of all other things that fly; and 
he gave it to his servant to be his steed.

86
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,160
It is this dreadful description of the 
winged shadow that precedes Theoden’s  

87
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,200
fateful encounter with the Lord of the Nazgul.  

88
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,160
And one aspect that comes up in many of these 
quotes is the stench of the Fell Beasts - a  

89
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,400
trait that understandably wasn’t communicated as 
strongly in the films as the fear they inspire

90
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:47,520
The Witch King of Angmar rides his foul steed 
into the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and shoots  

91
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,480
Theoden’s horse Snowmane with a dart, crushing 
the king. It is in this moment that Eowyn defends  

92
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,440
her dying uncle, and with a great swing of her 
sword, decapitates the winged terror of Mordor.

93
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,120
Once again, Frodo and Sam witness the flight 
of a Nazgul, (March 15) but this time, it  

94
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,320
was not seeking for the ring, or on a mission of 
Sauron’s, but delivering tidings to the Dark Lord…

95
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,200
...and then they saw a shape, moving 
at a great speed out of the West, 

96
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,200
at first only a black speck against 
the glimmering strip above the 

97
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,480
mountain-tops, but growing, until 
it plunged like a bolt into the dark 

98
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,720
canopy and passed high above them.  

99
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:38,000
As it went it sent out a long shrill
cry, the voice of a Nazgul; but this  

100
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,760
cry no longer held any terror for
them: it was a cry of woe and dismay,  

101
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,560
ill tidings for the Dark Tower.
The Lord of the Ringwraiths had met his doom.

102
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,840
The Winged Terrors are unleashed once 
again at the Battle of the Black Gate.  

103
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,840
However, the great eagles 
would come to the battle,  

104
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:07,560
bearing down upon the Nazgul. In that moment, a 
terrible call emanated from the Dark Tower, for  

105
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,240
Frodo had claimed the one ring for his own, and 
Sauron was aware the ring was now at Mount Doom.

106
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,480
The Winged Nazgul move with all speed 
to Orodruin, however, they are too late.  

107
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,360
The ring is destroyed when Gollum slips 
into the fiery depths of the mountain,  

108
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,720
and in the ensuing eruption, the Nazgul and 
their steeds are destroyed. Never to return.

109
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,840
We know now what happened to these winged beasts, 
but what of their origin? This will be a theory  

110
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,240
video for another day, but I want to hear what 
you think. Were they some descendant of dragons?  

111
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,000
Or perhaps eagles that were mutilated 
into foul beasts bound to the dark lord?  

112
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,720
were some other dreadful creature 
entirely, twisted by Sauron  

113
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,760
into their final monstrous form. Let 
me know what you think in the comments!
