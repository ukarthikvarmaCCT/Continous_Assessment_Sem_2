00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,892
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,892 --> 00:00:04,615
In 1854, when India was under British Colonial rule,

3
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:07,075
the then Governor General Lord Dalhousie

4
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:10,651
sent a 15-year-old child from Punjab to England.

5
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:12,065
Lord Dalhousie believed that

6
00:00:12,065 --> 00:00:15,274
the mother of this child was a threat
and had a bad character. 

7
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:17,804
and so it was important to take him away from the mother.

8
00:00:18,408 --> 00:00:22,030
In England, this child converts to Christianity,

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,559
and becomes fast friends with Queen Victoria's son Edward VII.

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,697
The responsibility of this child was given to the British Crown,

11
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,070
and an annual stipend was paid to him

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,999
of £50,000.

13
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:36,423
If you adjust it for inflation today,

14
00:00:36,423 --> 00:00:39,156
it would amount to ₹650 million per year.

15
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:42,278
Friends, this child wasn't an ordinary boy,

16
00:00:42,278 --> 00:00:44,096
he was Prince Duleep Singh.

17
00:00:44,096 --> 00:00:47,339
Known as Maharaja Duleep Singh as well.

18
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:50,431
The last ruler of the Sikh Empire in India.

19
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:54,219
Interestingly, 4 years before he was sent to England,

20
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:58,212
in 1849, when the British defeated the Sikhs in the battle,

21
00:00:58,212 --> 00:01:02,328
Lord Dalhousie had ordered the 11-year-old Duleep

22
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,102
to surrender a diamond to Queen Victoria.

23
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:07,479
This was the Kohinoor Diamond.

24
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:13,082
That year, it travelled 6,700 km on a ship,
to go to London.

25
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:15,616
A legend attached to the Kohinoor diamond states that,

26
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:19,066
"He who owns this diamond,
will own the world;

27
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:22,839
But will also know all its misfortunes."

28
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:24,729
It is a superstition

29
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:27,091
known as the Curse of Koh-i-noor.

30
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:31,003
Because friends, every person who owned Koh-i-noor,

31
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:35,609
had lived lives full of bloodshed, violence, and betrayals.

32
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:39,287
This is the most infamous diamond in history.

33
00:01:39,287 --> 00:01:40,811
In today's video,

34
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:44,445
come, let's us delve into the interesting story of Koh-i-Noor.

35
00:01:44,445 --> 00:01:46,264
"The Kohinoor Diamond

36
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:49,339
is kept in the Tower of London's Jewel House,

37
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:51,076
for many years,

38
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:55,129
but there have been regular demands to get it back from Britain."

39
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:57,818
"The Kohinoor diamond, during the rule of the British,

40
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,294
was taken from India to Britain.

41
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:02,280
And became the jewel of the Queen's crown."

42
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,641
"I saw the Kohinoor.

43
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:05,651
The first eyewitness description of it.

44
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:07,216
I saw the Kohinoor,

45
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:09,502
it was attached to the head of the peacock

46
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:10,739
on top of the Peacock Throne."

47
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:13,593
Friends, there are many prevalent theories regarding this.

48
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:15,372
About the origin of Kohinoor.

49
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:17,202
Where was it discovered?

50
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:20,338
A civil servant working for the East India Company,

51
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:21,654
Theo Metcalfe,

52
00:02:21,654 --> 00:02:24,141
wrote in his report that according to tradition,

53
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:26,205
this diamond was extracted during

54
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:27,629
the lifetime of Krishna.

55
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,144
But according to historians,

56
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:31,368
the most accepted view is that

57
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:34,762
this diamond was found in the Kollur Mines,

58
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:35,823
in the Golconda region.

59
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,076
Don't confuse it with the Kolar Mining area,

60
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:40,243
which was popularised in the KGF film.

61
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,886
The Golconda diamonds are found on the banks of the Krishna River.

62
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:45,790
On coastal Andhra Pradesh.

63
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,154
During the 18th century, this area

64
00:02:48,154 --> 00:02:49,899
was the only area in the world

65
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:51,467
where diamonds could be found.

66
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:55,985
Until 1725, when diamond mines were discovered in Brazil.

67
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:59,896
It isn't clear who was the one to discover the Kohinoor diamond and how,

68
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:04,351
but normally, the gemstones are found on the river beds of dried-up rivers.

69
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,963
Historically, we don't even know

70
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:09,445
when was it discovered exactly.

71
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:11,737
The best estimates of the historians claim that

72
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:15,940
it was discovered between the years 1100-1300.

73
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,617
It is believed that the first mention of Kohinoor was in a Hindu text in 1306.

74
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:22,870
The problem is that

75
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,845
no one knows the name of the text.

76
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:27,617
Nor does anyone know who wrote it.

77
00:03:27,617 --> 00:03:32,592
The first written record of the mention of Kohinoor was in 1526.

78
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:37,326
When the first Mughal emperor Zahirudin Babur came to India in 1526.

79
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:39,763
In Baburnama, he had written that

80
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:41,235
it is a diamond which

81
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:44,338
is worth half the daily expense of the whole world.

82
00:03:44,338 --> 00:03:47,714
It is believed that he had won the Kohinoor diamond as a prize

83
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:49,160
for winning a particular battle.

84
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,055
The second mention of Kohinoor was by Shah Jahan in 1628.

85
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:57,468
When he commissioned his famous Peacock Throne.

86
00:03:57,468 --> 00:03:59,879
It took 7 years for this throne to be finished.

87
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,729
And it was four times as expensive as the Taj Mahal.

88
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:06,506
A large amount of precious stones and gems were used to make this throne.

89
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:08,850
but of tnumbert precious gems

90
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,429
one was the Kohinoor diamond,

91
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:13,473
and the other was the Red Timur Ruby.

92
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:14,653
An interesting fact,

93
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:17,980
the Kohinoor wasn't the most precious gen owned by the Mughals.

94
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,382
The Mughals prefered the Timur Ruby

95
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:22,773
so that was the most valuable stone for them.

96
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:27,209
Because the Mughals preferred the brightly coloured stones

97
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:31,050
On the other hand, the Hindu and Sikh kings, preferred diamonds.

98
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,037
You can consider this as a personal preference.

99
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:34,351
But despite that.

100
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:37,033
the Kohinoor was given a prestigious place on the Peacock Throne,

101
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,855
by making it the eye of the Peacock.

102
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:41,941
The diamond hadn't been named Kohinoor yet.

103
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:43,149
Around 100 years later,

104
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,334
under the Mughals, Delhi had become one of the wealthiest cities in the world,

105
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,990
more than 2 million people lived here,

106
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,486
greater than the combined population of London and Paris.

107
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:54,052
But by this point in time,

108
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:56,235
the Mughal Empire had weakened.

109
00:04:56,235 --> 00:05:00,455
The wealth of Delhi attracted Persia's, Nadir Shah.

110
00:05:00,455 --> 00:05:04,025
In 1739, Nadir Shah invaded Delhi,

111
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:06,479
and defeated Mohammed Shah.

112
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,029
Mohammed Shah was the 15th Mughal emperor,

113
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:10,573
the great-grandson of Aurangzeb.

114
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:14,338
Nadir Shah too many treasures from Delhi with him when he returned.

115
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:17,342
700 elephants, 4,000 camels,

116
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:19,826
and 12,000 horses were needed

117
00:05:19,826 --> 00:05:21,403
to carry the treasures.

118
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:24,025
Among these treasures, was the Kohinoor diamond as well.

119
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,690
A common belief has it that

120
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,954
Nadir Shah had received a tip from an official working in the Mughal Empire,

121
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,674
that Mohammed Shah had hidden the Kohinoor diamond in his turban.

122
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:36,078
There used to be an old war custom of exchanging turbans,

123
00:05:36,078 --> 00:05:40,459
so Nadir Shah proposed to exchange turbans with Mohammed Shah,

124
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:42,501
when the Kohinoor diamond fell to the ground.

125
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:44,562
It shone so brightly under the light

126
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:46,826
that Nadir Shah uttered

127
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:48,116
Koh-i-Nur.

128
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:52,207
It literally meant Mountain of Light.

129
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:54,642
And thus this diamond was named.

130
00:05:54,642 --> 00:05:57,282
But Nadir Shah's financial official of the time,

131
00:05:57,282 --> 00:06:00,858
wrote a book Tarikh‐i 'Alam‐ara‐yi Nadiri.

132
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:04,271
The content of the book provided us with a written record.

133
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:08,520
That the Kohinoor was attached to the head of the Peacock Throne.

134
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,196
Nadir Shah took the Peacock Throne with him

135
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:16,835
and wore the Timur Ruby and Kohinoor diamond on his armband.

136
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,456
The origin story of the name of this diamond

137
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:20,654
may not be true.

138
00:06:20,654 --> 00:06:21,991
The part that it was hidden in a turban,

139
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:23,512
but it is true that

140
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:26,347
Nadir Shah had named this diamond Kohinoor.

141
00:06:26,347 --> 00:06:31,209
Because this book has the reference to the diamond as Kohinoor.

142
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:35,062
For the next 70 years, Kohinoor remained the part of present day Afghanistan.

143
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:38,668
This is where the Curse of Kohinoor comes to play.

144
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:40,690
I talked about it in the beginning of the video.

145
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,735
The owner of the diamond would own the world,

146
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:46,546
but all the misfortunes will fall on him.

147
00:06:46,546 --> 00:06:51,295
This saying is taken from the Hindu text written in 1306,

148
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:52,989
as I told you before,

149
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:56,686
it is believed to be the very first mention of the Kohinoor diamond.

150
00:06:56,686 --> 00:06:58,043
It is a superstition

151
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,893
but as you will see that it is true to some extent.

152
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:04,647
Misfortune fell on Nadir Shah on 1747.

153
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:07,925
When Nadir Shah was killed by his guard.

154
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:10,447
His empire collapsed as a result.

155
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:12,000
Ahmad Shah Durrani,

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,517
also known as Ahmad Khan Abdali.

157
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,636
Was a member of Nadir Shah's army.

158
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,733
He became the founder of the new Afghan empire.

159
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:23,005
And with it, the new owner of the Kohinoor diamond.

160
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:26,274
William Dalrymple and Anita Anand's book tells us

161
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:28,355
that the grandson of Nadir Shah,

162
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:29,431
Shahrukh Shah,

163
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:32,425
had molten lead poured on his head

164
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:35,041
similar to what was shown in Game of Thrones,

165
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,694
to find out where Kohinoor was hidden.

166
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:41,100
You can call it the curse of Kohinoor or anything else,

167
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,476
but there were a lot of infighting in the Durrani empire as well.

168
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:47,678
Ahmad's son Timur ran the empire adeptly.

169
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:50,513
but later, Ahmad's grandsons,

170
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:53,073
fought amongst each other for the throne.

171
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,597
Timur's son, the third ruler of the empire,

172
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:56,948
Zaman Shah Durrani,

173
00:07:56,948 --> 00:07:59,036
was blinded with hot needles.

174
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:02,088
His brother, the fifth ruler was Shuja Shah Durrani.

175
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:04,388
His wife had said that

176
00:08:04,388 --> 00:08:07,813
if a strong man threw four pebbles in four directions,

177
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,173
North, South, East, and West,

178
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:11,624
and then threw a fifth pebble into the air,

179
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,672
and the space enclosed by the five pebbles,

180
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:16,002
were filled with gold,

181
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:19,217
the value of all the gold there would still not match Kohinoor's value.

182
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:22,573
Shuja Shah Durrani wore the Kohinoor on his bracelet.

183
00:08:22,573 --> 00:08:26,053
In 1809, he was dethroned,

184
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:29,458
and he fled with the Kohinoor diamond to Lahore.

185
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:33,100
There he took refuge from Maharaja Ranjith Singh.

186
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,568
Ranjith Singh was the founder of the Sikh Empire,

187
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:37,635
and in exchange for providing refuge to Durrani,

188
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:39,710
he asked for the Kohinoor diamond.

189
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:45,640
And so the Kohinoor diamond went to the Sikh empire in 1813.

190
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,847
Even for Ranjith Singh, Kohinoor held a lot of symbolic importance.

191
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:51,063
The land usurped by the Durrani dynasty,

192
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,457
was won back by him.

193
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:55,072
He was known as the Lion of Lahore,

194
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:57,676
or the Sher-e-Punjab.

195
00:08:57,676 --> 00:09:00,833
And he wore the Kohinoor on his bicep.

196
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,544
In an armlet.

197
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:06,031
Some years later, East India Company's hold over India was getting stronger,

198
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:10,590
when the British came to know about the death of Ranjith Singh in 1839,

199
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,766
they also came to know of his plan

200
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:15,629
to give this diamond to some Hindu priests.

201
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,384
The British newspapers of the time,

202
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:19,480
were infuriated with this.

203
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,972
One of the newspapers published

204
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:24,181
"The richest, the most costly gem in the known world,

205
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:26,742
has been committed to the trust of a profane,

206
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:29,068
idolatrous, and mercenary priesthood."

207
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,574
The British government ordered the East India Company

208
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:33,292
to keep an eye on the Kohinoor diamond.

209
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,737
To continue tracking where it goes

210
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:38,142
and look for the opportunity to get it for the British treasury.

211
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:40,470
The British had to wait for nearly a decade.

212
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,052
After Ranjith Singh's death in 1839,

213
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:48,630
the Punjabi throne was passed on to four rulers over the next four years.

214
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,213
By 1843, there were only two people standing.

215
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:54,488
One, Ranjith Singh's wife Rani Jindan,

216
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:56,882
and the other, a five-year-old child.

217
00:09:56,882 --> 00:09:58,267
Prince Duleep Singh.

218
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:02,056
Finally, when the second Anglo-Sikh war ended in 1849,

219
00:10:02,056 --> 00:10:05,491
the East India Company ended the rule of the Punjab empire.

220
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:07,849
By then Duleep Singh was about 10 years old.

221
00:10:07,849 --> 00:10:11,409
EIC made him sign a Treaty of Lahore.

222
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:13,807
As per this treaty,

223
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:17,457
the Kohinoor diamond was supposed to be handed over to the East India Company.

224
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:20,966
Punjab was the last major state that hadn't been conquered by the British.

225
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,576
After winning this war,

226
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:25,220
the East India Company didn't want to leave any scope

227
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,917
to allow the Sikh Empire to sprout once again.

228
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,686
And so they jailed Jindan,

229
00:10:30,686 --> 00:10:32,975
and the only other remaining family member,

230
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:35,952
was shipped to London,

231
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,387
and converted to Christianity.

232
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,396
I told you this at the beginning of the video.

233
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:41,469
When Duleep Singh was merely 15-years-old,

234
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:44,321
he was sent to London in 1854.

235
00:10:44,321 --> 00:10:45,769
In July 1854,

236
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:48,878
when Duleep Singh's portrait was being painted in the Buckingham Palace,

237
00:10:48,878 --> 00:10:52,824
Queen Victoria gave him an opportunity to see the Kohinoor once again.

238
00:10:52,824 --> 00:10:54,763
He held it in his hand,

239
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:58,172
and it is said that the words he spoke were

240
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,994
During the last years of his life, Duleep Singh

241
00:11:08,994 --> 00:11:10,695
rebelled against England,

242
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:12,756
he tried to return to India,

243
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,227
but he was prevented by the British.

244
00:11:14,227 --> 00:11:17,050
He tried to get the help of the Germans.

245
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,660
But unfortunately, he remained unsuccessful.

246
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,819
It is said that he had an unfortunate death.

247
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:24,979
at 55 years old, in Paris.

248
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:27,387
His living conditions were quite bad by then,

249
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,625
he was living in poverty.

250
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:32,272
On the other hand, Kohinoor became a special possession of Queen Victoria,

251
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:33,720
interestingly,

252
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,499
the 'curse of Kohinoor'

253
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:37,485
warning any man who owned it,

254
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:39,395
also said that

255
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:46,709
Only a God or a woman can wear it with impunity.

256
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:48,342
Without any adverse consequences.

257
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:51,480
In 1851, in the Hyde Park of London,

258
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,326
an exhibition was held,

259
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:57,082
wherein the British people had the opportunity to see the Kohinoor.

260
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:59,392
But the public reaction was quite unexpected.

261
00:11:59,392 --> 00:12:04,348
People were surprised to see empires fighting over a small piece of rock. 

262
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,894
People couldn't believe that it was the same Kohinoor diamond

263
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,895
for which people had killed one another.

264
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:13,641
To them, it simply looked like a glass piece.

265
00:12:13,641 --> 00:12:16,018
Not unlike any normal piece of glass.

266
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:19,127
It was reported by the Times newspaper in June 1851.

267
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,241
After the disappointing reaction of the public,

268
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,587
Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert,

269
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:28,556
commissioned the recutting and polishing of Kohinoor in 1852.

270
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:32,029
So that light could be reflected better,

271
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:33,433
and it could shine more.

272
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:36,274
He wanted people to be mesmerised by looking at it.

273
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:38,044
But due to this process,

274
00:12:38,044 --> 00:12:40,806
Kohinoor lost 40% of its weight.

275
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:43,176
It used to be 186 carats,

276
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:45,994
and after the recutting and polishing,

277
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:48,552
it was left with 105.6 carats.

278
00:12:48,552 --> 00:12:50,999
presently, the dimensions of Kohinoor diamond are

279
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:58,776
Kohinoor is now about as big as a chicken's egg.

280
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:00,281
Moving on with our story,

281
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:01,768
when the British got their hands on Kohinoor,

282
00:13:01,768 --> 00:13:04,865
they too were scared of the Curse of Kohinoor.

283
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:07,982
So going forward, the British Royal Family decided

284
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:12,139
that they wouldn't give the Kohinoor to a man.

285
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,915
When the monarch would be male,

286
00:13:13,915 --> 00:13:16,341
the Queen Consort would be the one to wear the Kohinoor.

287
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:18,290
And that why's over the next years,

288
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,299
when the British throne was passed on,

289
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,788
Kohinoor always went to the Queen.

290
00:13:23,788 --> 00:13:26,409
Eventually, it became a part of the Crown Jewels.

291
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:28,908
It was first put in Queen Alexandra's crown,

292
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,659
then in Queen Mary's,

293
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:32,871
and finally in 1937,

294
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:34,266
it was embedded in the crown

295
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:38,072
worn by the mother of the present Queen of England.

296
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:40,897
The Queen Mother's funeral was held in 2002,

297
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:44,766
when the crown was last seen in public.

298
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,994
Currently, this crown and the Kohinoor,

299
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,836
can be found in the Tower of London's

300
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:50,927
Waterloo barracks,

301
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:52,713
in the Jewel House inside it.

302
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:53,830
They are kept there.

303
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,638
Over the last 800 years of Kohinoor's history,

304
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:59,671
the British monarchy has been the owner of Kohinoor for the longest.

305
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:02,983
Kohinoor has been with them for 173 years.

306
00:14:02,983 --> 00:14:06,133
If you want to know Kohinoor's story in detail,

307
00:14:06,133 --> 00:14:09,805
I recommend that you listen to this audiobook on KUKU FM.

Go check it out.

316
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,273
Now let's return to the topic.

317
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,986
Many Indians feel quite emotional towards the Kohinoor.

318
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,428
Shashi Tharoor's 2015 Oxford Union speech had become very famous.

319
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:42,886
"India's share of the world economy

320
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:44,333
when Britain arrived on its shores,

321
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,212
was 23%.

322
00:14:46,413 --> 00:14:47,783
By the time the British left,

323
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:49,278
it was down to below 4%.

324
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,390
India was already Britain's biggest cash cow,

325
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,712
the world's biggest purchaser of British goods,

326
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:54,822
and exports..."

327
00:14:54,822 --> 00:14:57,983
His arguments were praised by Prime Minister Modi as well.

328
00:14:57,983 --> 00:15:01,687
He laid out the economic and prosperity potential lost by India

329
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,222
due to British colonialism.

330
00:15:03,222 --> 00:15:06,155
And Kohinoor is now a symbol of this British colonialism.

331
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,647
The question is whether the Kohinoor diamond

332
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:10,374
was stolen by the British from India,

333
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:12,008
or was it a gift?

334
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:14,402
That was given to them in exchange of the deal.

335
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:17,314
1 year after Shashi Tharoor's 2015 speech,

336
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:21,949
in 2016, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court by an NGO.

337
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:26,325
The petition stated that the government should get the Kohinoor back.

338
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,339
That the Indian government should demand

339
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:30,105
that the British government return the diamond.

340
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:33,330
But Ranjith Kumar, the government's representative in court,

341
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,329
said that the diamond was a part of the Lahore Treaty,

342
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:40,264
neither has it been stolen nor taken forcefully,

343
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:42,738
and to try to get it back would be futile.

344
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:45,870
Later, the Archaeological Survey of India said on behalf of the government 

345
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,059
that they would try their best to get back the Kohinoor using friendly ways.

346
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:51,444
It was said that the arguments by Mr Kumar

347
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:53,784
did not represent the views of the government.

348
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:55,556
But legally speaking,

349
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:59,840
there are no legal grounds for Kohinoor's return to India.

350
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,839
The only legal route present here,

351
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,962
is the 1970 UNESCO Convention.

352
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,499
The Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing

353
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,702
the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of

354
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:10,407
Ownership of Cultural Property.

355
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:13,912
The cultural heritage of the country that was taken to another illegally,

356
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:15,127
through unfair means,

357
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:17,211
But there are two problems with this convention.

358
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:21,026
First, it cannot be applied retrospectively.

359
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:24,045
The cultural heritage that was taken before 1970,

360
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:25,800
does not have to be mandatorily returned.

361
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,258
And the other thing is that

362
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:31,021
Cultural Heritage has been defined in Article 1 of the Convention,

363
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:33,968
as a property which, on religious or secular grounds,

364
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:36,566
is specifically designated by each State

365
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:38,736
as being of importance for archaeology,

366
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:41,133
prehistory, history, literature, art or science

367
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,261
The second problem is that even if the  cultural heritage is returned,

368
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:45,918
which country should get it?

369
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:47,665
The situation is quite complicated,

370
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:50,119
because of the present borders drawn between the countries,

371
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,887
are quite recent.

372
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:54,170
The kingdoms which existed before this,

373
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,742
during the monarchies,

374
00:16:55,742 --> 00:16:57,851
had dynamic borders, which were redrawn very often.

375
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,342
Today, the sovereign territories of

376
00:17:00,342 --> 00:17:01,993
India, Afghanistan, and Pakistan,

377
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:04,977
exist only after their Independence.

378
00:17:04,977 --> 00:17:06,987
Before this, there used to be kingdoms.

379
00:17:06,987 --> 00:17:09,472
Technically speaking,

380
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:11,521
Kohinoor diamond has not been taken from the sovereign territories of

381
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:12,824
India, Afghanistan, or Pakistan.

382
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,800
Because those territories were created only after a specific date.

383
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,186
But the Kohinoor was taken before that from kingdoms.

384
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:19,787
Another question here is

385
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:22,348
whom should Kohinoor be returned to?

386
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:26,224
In Afghanistan, Taliban's spokesperson said in 2000,

387
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:28,425
that they want Kohinoor back in their country.

388
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:32,625
In 2016, a petition was filed in Pakistan's Lahore High Court,

389
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,112
because the British had stolen the Kohinoor

390
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:36,627
from present-day Pakistan.

391
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:39,032
Because the capital of the Sikh empire was Lahore.

392
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:43,089
Anthropologist Richard Kurin says that logically,

393
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:45,996
Kohinoor can be returned to several countries.

394
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:49,186
Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and even Iran

395
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:52,250
can rightfully claim the ownership of this diamond.

396
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,099
Because back then, stealing and plundering used to be quite common.

397
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:59,148
But back then, none of these countries existed.

398
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:01,798
Even though, geographically, their regions existed.

399
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:04,490
It should be differentiated from other events

400
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,997
for example, the cultural heritage stolen by the Nazis,

401
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:09,526
where it can be clearly seen

402
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:11,246
the country the theft took place in.

403
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:13,020
Because these countries existed already.

404
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,955
Emotionally as well, Richard Kurin says

405
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:18,604
we should let go of Kohinoor forever.

406
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:22,860
So that its dark history is not repeated,

407
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,206
and it is allowed to rest at its final resting place.

408
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,723
What is your opinion?

409
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:29,125
Write in the comment section below.

410
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,234
Should the government try to get Kohinoor back?

411
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:34,268
Or should we let it be there?

412
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:35,501
