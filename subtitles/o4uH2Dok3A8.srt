1
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:08,603
'My story begins in Lahore.'

2
00:00:09,203 --> 00:00:11,283
'No..
Not the Lahore'

3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,163
'which is a part of
another country now.'

4
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:18,403
'But the Lahore,
which was before the partition'

5
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:23,003
'not just the heart, but also
the crown jewel of India.'

6
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:26,563
'The city, where people
of different religions'

7
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:29,123
'lived together in
peace and harmony.'

8
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,403
'Neither the river Ravi
was partitioned'

9
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:33,963
'nor the country and not
even the hearts of people.'

10
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:36,363
'Even today,
when 'Dhol' is being played'

11
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,363
'at the Wagah border'

12
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:41,483
'it can be heard in Lahore,
20 miles away.'

13
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:44,723
'And Englishman named Radcliffe'

14
00:00:45,243 --> 00:00:48,803
'drew a line between us
in such a cruel way'

15
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:53,563
'that Lahore feels so far away
despite being so near.'

16
00:00:54,123 --> 00:00:57,563
'Where I was born
in a large mansion.'

17
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:00,403
'Where I lived for 16 years.'

18
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:02,523
'Made real friendship.'

19
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:05,363
'Where I dreamt of
the freedom of girls'

20
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:07,963
'along with the freedom
of the country.'

21
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:13,283
'And where I fell in love
for the first time.'

22
00:01:13,963 --> 00:01:16,243
'27 January, 1947.'

23
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:18,403
'We were celebrating
'Basant Panchami'

24
00:01:18,443 --> 00:01:20,043
'with a lot of happiness
and enthusiasm.'

25
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:22,003
'Unaware of the fact'

26
00:01:22,323 --> 00:01:24,203
'that it will be'

27
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:26,163
'the last 'Basant Panchami'

28
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:28,483
'at our home,
'Om Niwas', in Lahore.'

29
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,163
'After this day'

30
00:01:30,683 --> 00:01:34,083
'I will never be able
to see my house'

31
00:01:34,523 --> 00:01:37,523
'my neighbourhood,
or the sunrise'

32
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:40,283
'from the roof of our house.'

33
00:01:40,963 --> 00:01:41,843
'Take a look.'

00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:46,763
'My father,
Lala Ratan Kishore Sahni'

35
00:01:47,163 --> 00:01:49,523
'the famous rich man in Lahore'

36
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,723
'the owner of 'Lala Di Hatti'.

37
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:54,123
'The king of 'Masala Mewa'.'

38
00:01:54,563 --> 00:01:58,003
'He is so happy to embrace'

39
00:01:58,043 --> 00:02:00,203
'his best friend and neighbour'

40
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:03,003
'Dr. Baig.'

41
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:04,123
Come here, buddy!

42
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:08,363
Wish you a very happy
'Basant Panchami'.

43
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:10,083
To you too, buddy.

44
00:02:10,123 --> 00:02:11,363
Have a seat..

45
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,683
You tell me,
you came here alone?

46
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:19,883
Do I have to send a car
to the opposite house

47
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:21,483
to bring your wife here?

48
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:23,723
No, Zayeda has been
here since morning.

49
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:27,043
She and your wife are cooking
some 'Khichdi'.

50
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:29,523
Not 'Khichdi'.

51
00:02:31,563 --> 00:02:33,763
We were cooking yellow rice.

52
00:02:34,123 --> 00:02:36,283
Come, Zayeda, they've been
waiting since morning.

53
00:02:36,483 --> 00:02:37,643
Come on..

54
00:02:37,963 --> 00:02:39,483
Here you go..

55
00:02:41,363 --> 00:02:42,363
There you go.

56
00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:53,203
All right, let's start eating.

57
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:58,443
Well, you've waited for so long.
Wait for a bit longer.

58
00:02:58,483 --> 00:02:59,483
Have patience.

59
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,323
Before eating this sweet rice

60
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:03,203
you both will have
to give a test.

61
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:04,123
Yes.

62
00:03:04,363 --> 00:03:06,523
You will have to tell

63
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:09,563
which were cooked
by Lala's wife

64
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:12,083
and which were cooked by
Dr. Iqbal Baig's wife.

65
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:13,083
Yes.

66
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:15,123
Lala, we will have
to give the test

67
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:17,243
of our love in the
pretext of rice.

68
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:19,563
I'm not afraid of it.

69
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:22,843
Let's give the test.
- Wait, Lala..

70
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,843
Why do you want to embarrass
yourself at this age by failing?

71
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:30,683
Well, why don't you call
the apple of your eye?

72
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,763
She will take your test.

73
00:03:33,283 --> 00:03:34,243
Where is she?

74
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:37,363
She must be here somewhere
with your daughter.

75
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:38,723
Where else will she be!

76
00:03:39,283 --> 00:03:40,603
Where is our dear daughter?

77
00:03:41,163 --> 00:03:42,283
Amrut!

78
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:45,643
"Beloved!"

79
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:32,243
"Oh, sweet beloved!"

80
00:04:32,683 --> 00:04:35,283
"Oh charmer!"

81
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:38,523
"Oh, sweet beloved!"

82
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:41,603
"Oh charmer!"

83
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:48,643
"Oh, sweet beloved.."

84
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:13,443
Amrit.

85
00:05:23,763 --> 00:05:27,003
"Oh, sweet beloved.."

86
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:29,523
"Oh, sweet beloved.."

87
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:32,563
"Oh charmer!"

88
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:35,843
"Oh, sweet beloved.."

89
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:39,003
"Oh charmer!"

90
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:42,203
"Oh, sweet beloved.."

91
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:45,083
"Oh charmer!"

92
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:47,643
Vashma!

93
00:05:47,843 --> 00:05:51,603
Greetings to the heart
of Lahore

94
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:53,043
from Vashma.

95
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:54,483
Vashma, you're too much.

96
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:58,163
Let's talk about
the prettiest girl

97
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:00,323
in all of Lahore, Ms. Amrit.

98
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:01,723
What are you doing, Vashma?

99
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:04,563
She likes to dream
with her eyes closed

100
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:07,843
as well as with her eyes open.

101
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:11,323
And she believes in dreaming
of doing those things

102
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:13,963
she is restricted to

103
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:16,643
and be content with it.

104
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:20,443
But what do I tell her
about the beauty of dreams?

105
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:25,163
They come in a second,
and break the next second.

106
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:26,523
Vashma, you're..

107
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:30,003
Let's talk about her
latest dream.

108
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:35,083
Which just broke from
the sound of my footsteps.

109
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:36,763
Get lost.

110
00:06:38,163 --> 00:06:40,163
In your dream,
you saw yourself

111
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:43,243
in the middle of the street

112
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,963
playing the drums.

113
00:06:46,803 --> 00:06:51,563
Which included all your friends,
including me.

114
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:54,523
Such lovely dance moves.

115
00:06:55,443 --> 00:06:56,403
Hey!

116
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:58,243
Tell me I'm lying?

117
00:06:59,123 --> 00:07:01,883
Shut up.
- Oh, my!

118
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:05,003
Look at your red cheeks,
from blushing

119
00:07:05,243 --> 00:07:09,163
all the handsome, young
fellows

120
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:11,443
are looking at you from
their windows

121
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:13,523
and opened the window
to their hearts

122
00:07:13,723 --> 00:07:15,363
waiting for you.
- Vashma..

123
00:07:15,763 --> 00:07:19,123
And were your parents,
as well as mine

124
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:22,403
clapping hard?
- Stop it.

125
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,523
By the way,
the dream wasn't bad.

126
00:07:25,723 --> 00:07:27,603
But aren't you dreaming
a little too soon?

127
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:32,083
Yes.
- Oh, my!

128
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:35,883
And between all
the song and dance

129
00:07:36,243 --> 00:07:39,963
your heart throb must have
walked up to you and said..

130
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:41,403
Your dad is calling for you.

131
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:49,923
There goes my dream.
- Wake up!

132
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,523
Let's go.

133
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:56,323
Amrit, keep your
father's dignity.

134
00:07:56,683 --> 00:07:58,723
And your uncle's too.
- Yes.

135
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:01,083
Your mom and your aunt

136
00:08:01,323 --> 00:08:03,483
are testing us.

137
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,363
Hey..
- Wait, let her.

138
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:24,523
Now, tell me,
who cooked which one?

139
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:30,083
It's a difficult one
to answer, right?

140
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:32,763
No, Dad.

141
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:35,723
It's not a difficult question,
it's the wrong question.

142
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:38,643
Look at this.

143
00:08:39,003 --> 00:08:42,723
Both the rice grains from
Om Nivas and Baig Manzil

144
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:45,403
have come together in this bowl
and can't be called apart.

145
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:48,243
Until they can't be told apart

146
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:50,363
they'll taste good.

147
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,803
The day you can tell
them apart

148
00:08:53,523 --> 00:08:55,603
they'll become tasteless.

149
00:08:55,923 --> 00:08:57,163
Wow!

150
00:08:57,883 --> 00:09:00,643
Well said!
You've made me happy.

151
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:05,643
Here, you can have
whatever I've got in my pocket.

152
00:09:06,683 --> 00:09:07,643
No, Dad.

153
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:09,883
I don't need anything.

154
00:09:11,163 --> 00:09:15,323
Dear, you don't need anything,
by I do.

155
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:17,403
Go on, take it.

156
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,483
Sons gets everything
with their right.

157
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:25,083
But daughters refuse even when
you try to give them something.

158
00:09:36,603 --> 00:09:38,803
Oh, my God!

159
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:44,483
It's the ancestral bracelet,
isn't it? - Yes.

160
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:48,683
Are you going to give
all the treasure to her?

161
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,803
Shall I..
- Listen..

162
00:09:52,563 --> 00:09:54,843
You do not gift
the golden bracelets

163
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:57,763
to such a lovely daughter.

164
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:01,483
Instead, you put them
on her wrist.

165
00:10:01,763 --> 00:10:03,163
Look.

166
00:10:08,643 --> 00:10:09,523
Stay blessed.

167
00:10:09,763 --> 00:10:11,803
But..
- When you go in

168
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:14,243
keep this in the kitchen.
- Turn on the radio.

169
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:15,483
I haven't heard the news today.

170
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:17,963
Take Zara with you and bring
breakfast for everyone.

171
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:20,083
You should make the 'Lassi'.

172
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:22,363
Otherwise, he won't drink it.

173
00:10:22,803 --> 00:10:25,963
Go.
- You are so lucky, darling!

174
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:27,923
I will bring 'Lassi'.

175
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:31,843
What a lovely day?
Praise the lord.

176
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,683
Praise the lord.

177
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:41,483
This is your worth
in this family.

178
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:47,043
I am not expected to do anything
other than serving them.

179
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,323
He wants me to make
'Lassi' for him.

180
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:53,723
Yet he is giving
the bangle to her.

181
00:10:54,043 --> 00:10:57,363
Amrit, let everyone hear
what you said to me

182
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:58,363
about Delhi and Bombay.

183
00:10:58,763 --> 00:11:01,123
Delhi, Bombay,
Kolkata, Karachi..

184
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:04,363
The 'Masala', 'Mewa',
and 'Larchi' from Lala's shop

185
00:11:04,683 --> 00:11:06,763
are famous everywhere.

186
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:11,203
'Attacks in various places
in Kolkata'

187
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:13,683
'took the lives
of more than 12 people'

188
00:11:13,843 --> 00:11:17,203
'and around 50 people
got severely injured.'

189
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,283
'On account of these
religious riots'

190
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:23,203
'the leaders of both
the political parties'

191
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:27,563
'have asked the people
to maintain peace.'

192
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:30,083
'People are now worried that'

193
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:34,963
'the freedom received after
200 years of oppression'

194
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,083
'will be followed by division
of the country.'

195
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:40,723
'Considering the current
situation in the country'

196
00:11:40,843 --> 00:11:43,763
'the famous cartoonist
Ullu Lal's question'

197
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:45,203
'to the foreigners.'

198
00:11:45,643 --> 00:11:50,283
'Will they ruin the communal
harmony in the country?'

199
00:11:51,323 --> 00:11:53,283
Abdul, stop this nonsense.

200
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:55,523
There are riots in the nation

201
00:11:56,163 --> 00:11:58,403
and Ullu Lal finds it funny.

202
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:02,123
No matter how hard
the foreigners try

203
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:06,563
they won't be able to divide us.

204
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:09,083
Because, the freedom
was not a dream

205
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:10,563
exclusive to one community.

206
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:13,563
Instead, the entire nation
dreamed about it.

207
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:16,403
When the sound of the bell
from temples

208
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:19,003
and prayer from the mosque can
be heard together in the morning

209
00:12:19,523 --> 00:12:21,563
how can they divide it?

210
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,283
Go and alert them.

211
00:12:24,963 --> 00:12:27,723
Tell them that
those who celebrate

212
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:29,523
Diwali and Eid together..

213
00:12:30,443 --> 00:12:32,963
Will celebrate freedom as well.

214
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:34,923
Whatever pleases the God,
Lala.

215
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:36,483
Whatever pleases the God.

216
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:38,403
What do we say on
every 'Basant Panchami'?'

217
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:40,763
The spring is here,
and the winter is gone.

218
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,203
On the next 'Basant Panchami'
all of us will say together..

219
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:46,483
The spring is here..

220
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:48,123
The Englishmen..
- Are gone!

221
00:12:48,683 --> 00:12:49,723
Just watch..

222
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,843
As soon as we become free

223
00:12:54,443 --> 00:12:56,243
Lala, Ratan,
Kishore, and Sahwney

224
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:59,843
will adorn the entire Lahore

225
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:03,123
as if it is Diwali!
As if it is Eid!

226
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:04,683
And then..

227
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:09,483
You and I will remain
together such that

228
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:13,923
the entire Punjab
will be ecstatic.

229
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:16,243
I agree, Lala.

230
00:13:34,803 --> 00:13:38,243
God, please protect
father's faith.

231
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:39,563
It's enough.

232
00:13:39,723 --> 00:13:40,963
Why are you bothering the God.

233
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,083
There will be no partition.

234
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:45,683
I wish the same.

235
00:13:46,403 --> 00:13:48,563
But the news says..
- Forget about the news.

236
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,483
Look at this.
- What is it?

237
00:14:01,763 --> 00:14:03,003
Finally, it's here.

238
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:05,803
The letter?
- Yes.

239
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,243
The day when your lover..

240
00:14:08,003 --> 00:14:09,883
Be quiet.
- The day when

241
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:13,203
the lover's story is printed,
that's when you get the letter.

242
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:18,043
In the post box number 111.

243
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:20,043
Shall we go and get it?
- Yes!

244
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:24,563
But how can we go today?

245
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:26,523
It's a holiday today.

246
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:28,243
I cannot think of an excuse.

247
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:29,603
Why should you make an excuse?

248
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:32,723
We have a someone in this house

249
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:34,363
who can help us.

250
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:55,563
Wow!

251
00:14:56,003 --> 00:14:57,643
This is known
as dedication.

252
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:01,363
Mr. Dhyanchand, listen to what
I'm going to say very carefully.

253
00:15:01,843 --> 00:15:04,523
The way Ekalavya considered
Dronacharya as his teacher

254
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:09,003
Uday Kishore Sehmi is
considering you as his teacher.

255
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,963
And with your blessings

256
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,603
he wants to join the Indian team

257
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:14,643
and want to make India win
a gold medal.

258
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:17,803
So, Mr. Uday Kishore

259
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:20,443
don't you think
your dreams are too big?

260
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:24,563
Hey, those who have
an ugly face

261
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:27,043
should talk
in a pleasing manner at least.

262
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,683
Hey!

263
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:30,763
Do you think

264
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:33,363
that only you can have
ambitions?

265
00:15:33,643 --> 00:15:34,883
Look into my eyes.

266
00:15:35,163 --> 00:15:37,923
I've millions of dreams.

267
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:40,643
I can see that

268
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:42,723
you have millions
of ambitions.

269
00:15:43,283 --> 00:15:46,283
Ambitions of Surayah
and Noorjahan

270
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:47,643
Ambition to own jewels

271
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:48,603
and get married.

272
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:50,883
Girls like you have
no other ambitions.

273
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:52,283
Hey!
- Ma'am

274
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:58,403
One having ambitions
doesn't depend on their sex.

275
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:02,123
Male and females
both have ambitions.

276
00:16:03,043 --> 00:16:04,883
The only difference

277
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:07,443
is that women doesn't get
any support

278
00:16:07,763 --> 00:16:08,803
to fulfil their dreams.

279
00:16:10,323 --> 00:16:12,723
They struggle all their lives
because of that.

280
00:16:14,443 --> 00:16:15,603
Ignore that.
- Ignore that.

281
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:17,003
We want to go somewhere.

282
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:18,643
What do you mean?

283
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:19,763
It's a very important work.
- It's a very important work.

284
00:16:20,483 --> 00:16:22,403
What's wrong with you?
Just a minute.

285
00:16:22,963 --> 00:16:24,883
I can't help you.

286
00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:27,803
Don't think
that I'll help you.

287
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,403
Also, Mr. Bhanuveer
and our aunt

288
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:32,443
are at home today.

289
00:16:32,483 --> 00:16:34,003
If they..

290
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:37,963
That's why we need
your help.

291
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:40,563
We will finish our work
and return soon.

292
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:42,963
Where do you want
to go?

293
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:46,643
Both of you tell me something.

294
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:49,723
Let go of me.
- I helped you few times.

295
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:52,083
So, now you both started
asking for help every day.

296
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:55,643
Let go of me. - Mr. Bhanuveer
and aunt is at home.

297
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:57,043
If they come to know

298
00:16:57,043 --> 00:16:58,483
about our conspiracy

299
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:00,563
I don't know
what they will do to you both

300
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:04,003
but they will teach me
a lesson for sure.

301
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:05,283
Do you get it?
- Amrit

302
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:08,643
what's the use of tying rakhi
around your brother's wrist?

303
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,283
He doesn't even help you
when you need help.

304
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:13,523
Don't tie next time.

305
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,603
Hey

306
00:17:15,843 --> 00:17:18,803
don't change the topic.

307
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:19,763
Do you get it?

308
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:24,683
Where do you both
want to go?

309
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:27,803
We can't reveal that.

310
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:29,443
We also have ambitions

311
00:17:29,643 --> 00:17:30,763
and secrets.

312
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:32,843
We need only a small help
from you.

313
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:34,923
We will return soon, Veer.

314
00:17:35,043 --> 00:17:37,523
Please handle the situation.
We'll return soon.

315
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:39,003
We are leaving.
- Listen to me.

316
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,363
Hey, Amrit.

317
00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:42,203
Hey, Vashma, listen to me.

318
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:44,003
Also

319
00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:48,243
don't let the goal happen.

320
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,963
Vashma, listen to me.
- Let's go, Amrit.

321
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:53,563
Vashma

322
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:55,203
come fast.

323
00:17:56,883 --> 00:17:58,563
They will put me in trouble.

324
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:03,963
Uday.

325
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:06,563
Yes, Dad.

326
00:18:06,723 --> 00:18:07,683
I'm coming.

327
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:10,883
Come.

328
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:13,723
Where is Ms. Saira?
- Where is she?

329
00:18:14,363 --> 00:18:16,523
Ms. Saira.
- I'm coming.

330
00:18:16,643 --> 00:18:18,003
Come fast.
- Okay.

331
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:18,923
Give it fast.

332
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:21,883
Take this.

333
00:18:27,163 --> 00:18:28,403
We will return soon.

334
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:29,723
Handle the situation.
Okay?

335
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:30,963
Go.

336
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:52,083
Sir, greetings.
- Greetings.

337
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:56,483
Post box number..
- 111.

338
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,483
She meant, letter from 111.

339
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:06,443
Give me.
- Vashma.

340
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,923
Come.
- Thank you..

341
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:23,843
Vashma.
- Hey!

342
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:24,883
What happened?

343
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:26,243
Look at that.

344
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:28,283
Stay away and watch.

345
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:29,883
No one should touch him.

346
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,403
Leave..

347
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:32,683
Move back..

348
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:33,563
What are you doing?

349
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,083
Move back.

350
00:19:35,563 --> 00:19:36,603
Kid, move back.

351
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:37,963
Stay away and watch.

352
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:40,403
That is Ullu lal's statue

353
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:42,003
the cartoon character
of Randhir Raizada.

354
00:19:42,203 --> 00:19:43,123
Yes!

355
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:45,043
But why and who has
someone kept this statue

356
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,883
in the middle of the market?

357
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,243
Look, something is
written there.

358
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:50,483
What is written?

359
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:52,083
'When the country gets freedom'

360
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:54,683
'will the girls also
get freedom'

361
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:58,563
'to play the drums
and perform 'bhangra'?'

362
00:20:02,963 --> 00:20:04,723
I dream about this.

363
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:10,163
Where are you lost?

364
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:12,923
Hurry up. If we get late,
Uday won't be able to handle it.

365
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,643
It will be a problem.
Let's go.

366
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:16,803
Come, let's go. We'll get late.
- Vashma!

367
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:18,883
Letter!

368
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,643
Where are you lost, Uday?

369
00:20:23,163 --> 00:20:24,883
I have told you several times.

370
00:20:25,163 --> 00:20:27,963
Come quickly
whenever I call you.

371
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:29,083
You should not be late.

372
00:20:30,443 --> 00:20:31,323
But no!

373
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:33,803
I am calling you.

374
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:35,563
Let me keep calling you.
How does it make a difference?

375
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,843
I am already ill-fated.
My son is also useless.

376
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:43,563
Hey, your love for hockey
has driven you crazy.

377
00:20:44,883 --> 00:20:45,923
I have told you several times.

378
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:48,443
Forget hockey and help

379
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:50,283
your father and uncle out.

380
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,403
People believe that a young son

381
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,083
is a father's strength.

382
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:01,123
Here, my father is useless
and my son too.

383
00:21:01,603 --> 00:21:02,643
What are you doing?

384
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,803
Dad, I'm sorry.
- Do it properly.

385
00:21:06,323 --> 00:21:09,723
Amrit, Vashma, where are you?

386
00:21:09,763 --> 00:21:11,243
Don't you want to fly kites?

387
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,923
Kiran, go and see
where they are.

388
00:21:17,123 --> 00:21:18,683
Call them, dear.

389
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:22,483
I had gone to Amrit's room.

390
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:24,323
She is not there.

391
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:29,723
She is not there.
Where could she go?

392
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,243
I'll go and inform mom.

393
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:41,763
The security person
is not letting us go in front.

394
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:42,483
How do we go there?

395
00:21:44,363 --> 00:21:45,963
Wait, I'll do something.

396
00:22:43,123 --> 00:22:44,283
Amrit!

397
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:48,643
The kites of Lahore
are touching the sky.

398
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:51,803
And the one who will hold
the thread of my brother's kite

399
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:54,523
is sitting inside.
- Aunt!

400
00:22:54,563 --> 00:22:56,083
Are you trying to scare me?

401
00:22:56,283 --> 00:22:57,603
Where are you going?

402
00:22:57,883 --> 00:23:00,723
Go to the mansion and fly kites.

403
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:02,323
I'll bring them. You go.

404
00:23:02,603 --> 00:23:04,603
You think my niece is a kid?

405
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:06,363
You move aside.
Look at this.

406
00:23:06,883 --> 00:23:10,443
Look, I've got a special thread
fixed

407
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:12,523
for the kite.

408
00:23:14,963 --> 00:23:16,643
Nobody listens to me.

409
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:19,323
You are here?
- Yes.

410
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:21,083
Aunt, that's what
I am telling you.

411
00:23:21,163 --> 00:23:23,723
Go to the mansion and fly kites.

412
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:26,403
I'll bring both of them.
- Really?

413
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:29,843
Will you tell me what to do?

414
00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:31,363
I too want to see

415
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:34,243
what the two of them
are doing inside.

416
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:36,523
Move aside.
- I'll tell you.

417
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:37,763
Listen to me, Aunt.

418
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:39,923
Aunt, they..

419
00:23:39,963 --> 00:23:42,603
They are doing something
special inside.

420
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,963
Oh, my God!

421
00:23:46,283 --> 00:23:49,163
They must be doing
something really special.

422
00:23:49,323 --> 00:23:52,683
That's why they've asked you

423
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,363
to guard their room.
Guard!

424
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:56,883
Come on, move aside.
- I'll bring them.

425
00:23:56,923 --> 00:23:58,483
I said, move aside.
- Aunt.

426
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:00,843
Move aside.
- Aunt, I'll bring them. You go.

427
00:24:00,883 --> 00:24:02,683
I'll bring them. - Move aside.
- Why are you arguing?

428
00:24:03,003 --> 00:24:05,323
Don't we have to go to
the mansion to fly kites?

429
00:24:05,763 --> 00:24:07,243
What happened to both of you?

430
00:24:07,283 --> 00:24:08,443
Tell me, what is happening here?

431
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:10,963
Brother, Amrit is not opening
the door

432
00:24:11,003 --> 00:24:12,043
and he is saying

433
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,523
that she is doing
something special inside.

434
00:24:13,683 --> 00:24:16,643
That's what I'm saying.
You guys go.

435
00:24:16,683 --> 00:24:19,283
Amrit is doing
something special inside.

436
00:24:19,323 --> 00:24:22,043
She's doing something special
for uncle. - Really?

437
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:25,563
Brother, do you know
what is she doing inside?

438
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:28,163
Yes, I know.

439
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:30,403
I know everything.

440
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:33,323
Tell us if you know.

441
00:24:34,003 --> 00:24:37,563
Uncle, she's making
a waistcoat for you.

442
00:24:38,563 --> 00:24:40,483
Brother Uday had told me.

443
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:42,203
Am I right?
- Yes, actually..

444
00:24:42,923 --> 00:24:43,923
Waistcoat..

445
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:46,283
Amrit is preparing
the same inside

446
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:47,763
for uncle.
- Yes, but..

447
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:49,963
That was kept
in the drawing room.

448
00:24:51,883 --> 00:24:52,683
Here it is.

449
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:56,883
"Oh, Lord.."

450
00:24:59,643 --> 00:25:01,163
Oh, God..

451
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:05,083
This means..
Udit, you are lying!

452
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:07,643
How come he will speak the truth
who himself is a liar?

453
00:25:28,603 --> 00:25:29,443
Dad!

454
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:34,603
Because of hockey

455
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,683
you are going
beyond our control.

456
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,443
Dad, please spare it.

457
00:25:39,523 --> 00:25:42,323
Because of hockey..
- Dad!

458
00:25:42,763 --> 00:25:44,243
Because of hockey..

459
00:25:44,403 --> 00:25:45,243
To heck with this..

460
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:48,043
Because of hockey..

461
00:25:50,763 --> 00:25:52,003
Uncle, what are you doing?

462
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:53,443
You should thank God

463
00:25:54,483 --> 00:25:55,603
that I have just broken
the hockey stick.

464
00:25:56,883 --> 00:25:58,003
I didn't thrash his face.

465
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:00,123
Open the door!
- Brij.

466
00:26:15,163 --> 00:26:16,763
Amrit, you got the letter?
- Yes.

467
00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:18,163
Vashma.

468
00:26:18,763 --> 00:26:21,283
It is not a statue.
He is a human being.

469
00:26:23,043 --> 00:26:23,803
What!

470
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:26,003
He is deceiving people
by posing as a statue!

471
00:26:26,723 --> 00:26:28,163
I will tell everyone.
- Fashma!

472
00:26:29,363 --> 00:26:31,203
Lower your voice.
And he is not deceiving people.

473
00:26:32,683 --> 00:26:33,763
Whoever he may be

474
00:26:34,483 --> 00:26:35,323
it's possible

475
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:38,683
even he has a dream like me.

476
00:26:40,483 --> 00:26:43,283
And we shouldn't
shatter someone's dream.

477
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:55,683
Amrit, he is Ullu Laal
built by Randhir Raizada.

478
00:26:55,803 --> 00:26:56,883
He is not Randhir.

479
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,163
Let's go quickly now.

480
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,403
Uday shouldn't be in trouble
because of us.

481
00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:01,603
Come on.
Let's go quickly.

482
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:10,443
"Why did I leave
my heart behind?"

483
00:27:10,603 --> 00:27:15,923
"Why did I leave
my heart behind?"

484
00:27:27,883 --> 00:27:28,723
Amrit.

485
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:31,043
Amrit!

486
00:27:32,403 --> 00:27:33,443
Brother, let me check.

487
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:35,043
Amrit.

488
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:39,243
Amrit.
Oh, God..

489
00:27:40,883 --> 00:27:42,643
Oh, God..

490
00:27:43,283 --> 00:27:45,563
Brother, Amrit is not here.

491
00:27:54,763 --> 00:27:55,683
Whoever he may be

492
00:27:56,603 --> 00:27:57,523
who was he?

493
00:28:19,803 --> 00:28:22,483
And why was he standing
in the middle of the market?

494
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:25,123
Because if you want to touch
people's heart

495
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:27,963
your message should be
conveyed in a unique style.

496
00:28:28,563 --> 00:28:32,243
Then people like your message.
And they remember that too.

497
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:35,683
I have learned this new
style of marketing in London.

498
00:28:36,363 --> 00:28:39,283
Who has taught Amrit
how to lie?

499
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:41,403
Oh, God!

500
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:44,923
What will she do?

501
00:28:45,403 --> 00:28:46,923
Will she die?

502
00:28:48,923 --> 00:28:51,243
May I be disgraced
all my life.

503
00:28:52,443 --> 00:28:53,603
I am not saying this.

504
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:55,403
People say this.

505
00:28:56,163 --> 00:29:00,883
People say that when a young
girl lies to go out of the house

506
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:04,283
this means,
something is fishy for sure.

507
00:29:07,683 --> 00:29:09,763
I know she is an apple
of your eye.

508
00:29:10,323 --> 00:29:13,083
But one shouldn't be
so lenient to his child

509
00:29:14,683 --> 00:29:17,403
that she becomes audacious.

510
00:29:18,243 --> 00:29:20,483
Oh, God..

511
00:29:22,203 --> 00:29:24,043
I swear on Kiranbala.

512
00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:27,363
I can still read your mind.

513
00:29:28,323 --> 00:29:32,283
I was 14 years old
when you fixed my marriage.

514
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:33,963
Why?

515
00:29:36,403 --> 00:29:37,763
You feared

516
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:41,683
that your love and affection
may spoil me.

517
00:29:43,003 --> 00:29:45,083
How old is Amrit?

518
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:46,763
Sixteen?

519
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:50,203
This is the age
when people make mistakes.

520
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:52,083
Think about it, Brother.

521
00:29:52,163 --> 00:29:54,323
Oh dear Lord!

522
00:29:54,563 --> 00:29:56,643
"Dear Lord!"

523
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:12,243
Imagine..

524
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,803
What if Ullulaal
was Mr. Randhir?

525
00:30:18,323 --> 00:30:20,803
When this letter flew
in the air and reached him..

526
00:30:21,563 --> 00:30:23,843
What if he came to know
about Ranjhan?

527
00:30:24,243 --> 00:30:26,723
Sooner or later, I will find
out information about Ranjhan.

528
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:28,523
Of course, sir.

529
00:30:28,603 --> 00:30:30,523
After all you are Randhir Ray.

530
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:32,083
Sir, tea.

531
00:30:32,443 --> 00:30:33,483
Thank you.

532
00:30:33,723 --> 00:30:34,923
Well, Mr. Sharfu..

533
00:30:35,163 --> 00:30:36,883
There was something special
about the lady in burqa too.

534
00:30:39,843 --> 00:30:42,403
'If I could see the moon
hidden in the clouds..'

535
00:30:44,523 --> 00:30:46,723
'...then my sky would have
also been filled with light.'

536
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:50,763
'Looking into her eyes
has started something..'

537
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:55,083
Maybe I would have fallen
in love if I had seen her face.

538
00:30:59,363 --> 00:31:00,403
Come, hurry up..

539
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:05,803
Where have you been?

540
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,603
You know, everything
is messed up.

541
00:31:07,763 --> 00:31:10,403
Your dad came to your room
and opened the door.

542
00:31:10,683 --> 00:31:12,003
He knows everything.

543
00:31:12,123 --> 00:31:14,123
And Kiranbala has made the mess.

544
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:15,883
Now?

545
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:19,363
Hey, listen. Shut up!

546
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:21,683
Oh! Brother..

547
00:31:21,763 --> 00:31:24,043
She is the young girl
from our family.

548
00:31:24,363 --> 00:31:26,963
If she gets into a love affair

549
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:31,723
then can you stop the people
of Lahore from making gossip?

550
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:34,123
Dear Lord!

551
00:31:42,243 --> 00:31:44,003
I can't help it.

552
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:45,763
My worry is killing me.

553
00:31:46,283 --> 00:31:47,163
Where did you go

554
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:49,803
without informing
or telling anyone?

555
00:31:49,883 --> 00:31:50,883
Where did you go?

556
00:31:51,003 --> 00:31:53,643
Look.. Look at your father.

557
00:31:53,763 --> 00:31:55,603
Just look at him.
Where did you..

558
00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:02,763
Answer me, Amrit.

559
00:32:04,403 --> 00:32:06,883
I was proud of the way
I raised you.

560
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:11,963
I trusted you more than myself.

561
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:18,723
Swear on me and tell me..

562
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:20,883
Swear and tell..

563
00:32:22,043 --> 00:32:26,203
Do you.. Do you have a love..
- No.

564
00:32:28,003 --> 00:32:29,323
No, Father.

565
00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:31,803
I swear on you.

566
00:32:32,443 --> 00:32:34,923
There's nothing like that.

567
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:46,523
Then..

568
00:32:48,323 --> 00:32:50,283
Why did you lie and go out?

569
00:32:51,843 --> 00:32:54,483
Amrit, tell everyone
that where we went.

570
00:32:57,723 --> 00:32:59,883
Uncle asked you something.

571
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:02,243
You have to tell everyone.

572
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:03,603
Uncle..

573
00:33:03,723 --> 00:33:05,763
We went to bring
something for you.

574
00:33:06,003 --> 00:33:06,883
Here it is.

575
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:09,163
Your hookah-pot was broken.

576
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:11,203
So, Amrit said that when
you will ask for hookah

577
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:13,763
in the evening then
we will be in trouble.

578
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:16,403
So, we went to buy this.

579
00:33:18,723 --> 00:33:19,763
Hookah's pot?

580
00:33:19,883 --> 00:33:22,323
Thank God!
There is no confusion now.

581
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:25,003
It was dragged too much
for nothing.

582
00:33:25,123 --> 00:33:26,683
Sister-in-law is right.

583
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,403
Both of you have done
a good job.

584
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,083
You bought this for brother.

585
00:33:32,683 --> 00:33:36,763
But why did you go alone?
It is a festive day.

586
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:41,923
We saw you smoking the hookah.
- There are others in the house.

587
00:33:43,163 --> 00:33:45,683
Why did you lie and go out?
- Shall I tell everyone?

588
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:47,003
Yes, Aunt.

589
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:48,803
You are absolutely right.

590
00:33:49,203 --> 00:33:51,883
But to save Kiranbala
from getting scolded..

591
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:54,123
We went alone.
- Hey..

592
00:33:54,483 --> 00:33:56,443
Why are you dragging
my daughter in this?

593
00:33:56,603 --> 00:33:57,803
Dear Lord!

594
00:33:58,363 --> 00:33:59,243
Yes, Uncle.

595
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:01,683
She was playing with your hookah
last night.

596
00:34:02,043 --> 00:34:03,603
And she broke it.

597
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:06,043
Amrit made me and Uday swear

598
00:34:06,283 --> 00:34:07,723
so that we don't tell
this to anyone.

599
00:34:07,883 --> 00:34:10,003
And that we should get
a hookah-pot quickly.

600
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:15,203
She said that she will feel bad
if Kiranbala is scolded.

601
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:16,683
Am I right, Kiranbala?

602
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:18,123
Say something.

603
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:20,203
Kiranbala..

604
00:34:20,363 --> 00:34:23,003
Y-Yes.

605
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:28,403
Actually, I broke it by mistake.

606
00:34:28,563 --> 00:34:31,283
So, I told Amrit

607
00:34:31,643 --> 00:34:33,563
not to tell anyone.

608
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:36,643
This is not a toy.

609
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:38,603
You are not a kid anymore.

610
00:34:41,203 --> 00:34:42,523
Even you listen..

611
00:34:43,003 --> 00:34:44,083
From today

612
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:48,763
never lie
and go out of the house.

613
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:58,403
If a lie brushes past the truth

614
00:34:59,643 --> 00:35:02,323
the truth loses its colour.

615
00:35:12,763 --> 00:35:15,483
Sir, our accountant is here.

616
00:35:15,563 --> 00:35:18,203
Make him feel comfortable,
we'll be there. - Okay.

617
00:35:29,683 --> 00:35:31,523
Kiranbala..

618
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:37,043
Come downstairs. I need to have
a word with you.

619
00:35:38,323 --> 00:35:40,163
Okay, Mother.

620
00:35:41,843 --> 00:35:43,203
Come downstairs!

621
00:36:27,203 --> 00:36:28,283
Kiran..

622
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,483
The tree at our backyard

623
00:36:33,243 --> 00:36:37,323
which has a beehive..
From which honey drips..

624
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:38,963
I hope you saw it.

625
00:36:39,203 --> 00:36:42,803
Try putting your hand inside
that beehive for no reason.

626
00:36:42,843 --> 00:36:46,923
The stings will be so painful,
you'll not be able to bear it.

627
00:36:47,523 --> 00:36:49,123
I gave you the hint.

628
00:36:49,523 --> 00:36:52,523
I hope you're intelligent
to understand it.

629
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,803
Step aside! - Hey!

630
00:36:59,123 --> 00:37:00,523
Vashma.

631
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:12,603
Let us see it.
- Of course!

632
00:37:14,363 --> 00:37:16,923
Apologise! Come on!
- Stop it.

633
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:21,523
Sir, had I known, I'd to face
embarrassment for her

634
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,083
I would've throttled her before
she was born! - Accountant!

635
00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:26,843
Get up.
- Calm down.

636
00:37:27,483 --> 00:37:30,843
Stop getting violent.
- I've no options, sir.

637
00:37:32,123 --> 00:37:35,963
I searched
a suitable boy for her.

638
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,003
Even the wedding date
was finalised

639
00:37:38,443 --> 00:37:42,163
but she is adamant
to see the boy

640
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:44,643
before she marries him.

641
00:37:47,123 --> 00:37:50,883
She has been guiled
by someone named Raanjhan.

642
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:52,883
Raanjhan? Who is that person?

643
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:57,483
No idea.. Whose love stories
have brainwashed my daughter!

644
00:38:00,923 --> 00:38:03,003
Amrit.. Amrit, show it to me.

645
00:38:03,963 --> 00:38:05,683
Let me read it.
- Hey!

646
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:07,803
'Raanjhan..'

647
00:38:07,843 --> 00:38:10,843
'I saw London, Paris, Prague,
Austria..'

648
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:14,363
'I'm yearning to see you.'
- Oh, my!

649
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:19,443
'My newspaper publishes
your stories..'

650
00:38:19,643 --> 00:38:23,443
'And believe me, you never
made me wait for the stories.'

651
00:38:23,643 --> 00:38:25,403
'Your stories come in time
every month.'

652
00:38:25,843 --> 00:38:28,403
'Then, why make me wait
for your letters, Raanjhan?'

653
00:38:28,443 --> 00:38:30,363
It's my turn to read it.
- Let me read it.

654
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:32,483
I was reading it..
- It's my turn.

655
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:34,643
Okay. Read it.

656
00:38:34,883 --> 00:38:38,763
'I don't know if you did it,
but I've counted it.'

657
00:38:38,803 --> 00:38:43,323
'I've written 11 letters
but never received any reply.'

658
00:38:44,043 --> 00:38:46,763
'Do you like to take time?'

659
00:38:46,803 --> 00:38:50,203
'Are you a coward?'

660
00:38:50,323 --> 00:38:52,723
Even he says that.

661
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:58,603
'Whose stories are always
about unbridled love..'

662
00:38:58,643 --> 00:39:00,523
'Love knows no guilt.'

663
00:39:00,683 --> 00:39:03,243
'An inspiration
for the young girls..'

664
00:39:03,403 --> 00:39:05,283
'It is showing them
a new direction.'

665
00:39:05,363 --> 00:39:09,243
'It is making them feel
their rights and freedom'

666
00:39:09,523 --> 00:39:12,563
'why has he himself
hiding his identity?'

667
00:39:12,763 --> 00:39:15,843
'Not Crime but Love.'
'Love Knows No Shame.'

668
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:19,594
And now, his new love story..
'Vibrant Love'.

669
00:39:20,043 --> 00:39:23,883
Sir, the female character
of this story is so shameless

670
00:39:23,963 --> 00:39:28,323
she tells her father, she'll not
marry until she sees the boy.

671
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:30,923
She says, she has to lead
her life with him.

672
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:32,763
What if she's a daughter..

673
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,763
She says, she has her
views and desires.

674
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:37,963
Sir, there is so much
to tell you..

675
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:40,403
This story also has the lines..

676
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:43,123
We will actually be free

677
00:39:43,963 --> 00:39:46,603
when girls are free to take
decisions for themselves.

678
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:49,243
Well, when girls

679
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:52,043
read such stories,
they will be misled.

680
00:39:52,403 --> 00:39:53,683
She is my daughter.

681
00:39:53,883 --> 00:39:55,363
Not any foreigner.

682
00:40:01,254 --> 00:40:03,894
'You should read your
stories out on radio'

683
00:40:04,414 --> 00:40:07,734
'so that these stories can
inspire more and more people.'

684
00:40:08,814 --> 00:40:12,374
'I have talked
to Radio Lahore in this regard.'

685
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,334
'I am waiting for your consent.'

686
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:21,614
'Be it from the lover
or the beloved'

687
00:40:21,974 --> 00:40:23,654
'rejection hurts alike.'

688
00:40:24,134 --> 00:40:25,934
'But making someone wait
impatiently'

689
00:40:26,214 --> 00:40:28,774
'is something that
damsels do, not writers.'

690
00:40:29,454 --> 00:40:30,974
'Awaiting a positive reply.'

691
00:40:31,614 --> 00:40:32,694
'Randhir Raizada.'

692
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:35,014
Oh my..

693
00:40:35,494 --> 00:40:37,654
If someone had said
such lovely words to me

694
00:40:38,054 --> 00:40:40,614
I would have agreed in no time.

695
00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:43,934
So my dear Amrit aka Ranjhan..

696
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:46,054
I suggest you accept his offer.

697
00:40:46,294 --> 00:40:48,534
Really? Should I meet him?

698
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:51,014
Shall I tell him I am Ranjhan?

699
00:40:51,454 --> 00:40:52,774
Of course!

700
00:40:53,094 --> 00:40:55,334
Meet him and tell your
stories on the radio.

701
00:40:55,614 --> 00:40:57,974
Tell him that the Ranjhan
who writes love stories

702
00:40:58,334 --> 00:40:59,654
is none other than Amrit Sahni.

703
00:41:01,014 --> 00:41:02,614
It's not so easy, pal.

704
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:06,414
Work a way out.

705
00:41:06,814 --> 00:41:10,734
The Randhir Raizada who girls
of Punjab are eager to meet..

706
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:15,294
The one whose mention brings
a smile on your face..

707
00:41:16,094 --> 00:41:19,534
This is the 11th letter
he has written to you.

708
00:41:20,294 --> 00:41:22,014
And you say it is not easy.

709
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:24,214
What are your feelings?

710
00:41:25,054 --> 00:41:27,094
I feel like writing
all my stories

711
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:28,414
under the name Amrit Sahni.

712
00:41:33,014 --> 00:41:35,374
I don't want to hide
behind any aliases.

713
00:41:37,134 --> 00:41:41,454
I want this city
to know me as a good writer.

714
00:41:41,694 --> 00:41:44,014
I want dad to be proud of me.

715
00:41:44,374 --> 00:41:46,414
I want him to be proud
of me as a writer.

716
00:41:48,694 --> 00:41:50,494
I will tell him the truth.

717
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,654
I want to tell my family that

718
00:41:53,174 --> 00:41:54,974
the famous writer
Ranjhan is none other than

719
00:41:55,854 --> 00:41:57,134
their daughter Amrit.

720
00:42:00,974 --> 00:42:02,694
What if dad doesn't like it?

721
00:42:03,294 --> 00:42:06,534
Dear, this shameless Ranjhan..

722
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:10,134
Don't read the nonsense
stories by this writer.

723
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:11,814
They will mislead you.

724
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:14,734
Decisions of women's rights..

725
00:42:15,774 --> 00:42:17,134
..can be taken their father

726
00:42:17,854 --> 00:42:21,454
brothers or sons.
By only these people..

727
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:25,854
Women can get respect
and love.

728
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,534
But they do not have
the right make decisions.

729
00:42:29,774 --> 00:42:31,294
Do you understand?

730
00:42:36,094 --> 00:42:38,294
Accountant, take her home.

731
00:42:38,574 --> 00:42:40,054
Do not scold her.

732
00:42:41,254 --> 00:42:43,214
I have convinced her.

733
00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:44,494
Go on now, dear.

734
00:42:48,214 --> 00:42:50,054
Anu.
- Yes.

735
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:08,494
He might feel a little bad

736
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:10,654
but it is 'Vasant Panchmi'
today, Amrit.

737
00:43:11,134 --> 00:43:12,654
Your father is so happy.

738
00:43:13,214 --> 00:43:14,854
Go on and tell him.

739
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:18,134
I am with you and we will
talk to him.

740
00:43:18,614 --> 00:43:21,174
And we will show him
the letter of Randhir.

741
00:43:21,774 --> 00:43:26,374
He is no simpleton.
He is from a prominent family.

742
00:43:26,734 --> 00:43:31,414
He has praised you so well.
Let us see this through.

743
00:43:32,734 --> 00:43:34,974
Tell your father
that you are Ranjhan.

744
00:43:43,494 --> 00:43:45,774
By the Gods, if I ever found
this Ranjhan

745
00:43:46,094 --> 00:43:49,214
I'll thrash him so badly
in the city square

746
00:43:49,374 --> 00:43:51,294
that he will forget his own name

747
00:43:51,854 --> 00:43:53,494
let alone writing these
foul stories!

748
00:43:53,854 --> 00:43:55,814
Shame on such writers!

749
00:43:56,374 --> 00:44:00,294
One who spreads vile filth
in the name of change.

750
00:44:00,814 --> 00:44:04,294
And he poisons of minds
of our women

751
00:44:05,374 --> 00:44:07,014
leading them to become
shameless!

752
00:44:08,094 --> 00:44:09,374
Please listen to me.

753
00:44:09,854 --> 00:44:10,854
Just listen to me once.

754
00:44:27,254 --> 00:44:29,374
'If I ever find this Ranjhan..'

755
00:44:29,414 --> 00:44:31,254
'Shame on such writers!'

756
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:32,934
'I will thrash him so badly!'

757
00:44:32,974 --> 00:44:37,014
'He poisons the mind
of our women..'

758
00:44:38,854 --> 00:44:43,254
My dreams are shattered
yet again.

759
00:44:54,494 --> 00:44:55,214
I would rather die

760
00:44:57,974 --> 00:45:00,854
but never let father know

761
00:45:01,854 --> 00:45:06,294
that I am Ranjhan.

762
00:45:13,254 --> 00:45:15,334
No.
