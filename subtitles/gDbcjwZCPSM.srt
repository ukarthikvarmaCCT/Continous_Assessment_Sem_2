JAMEY TUCKER HAS FOUND A

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,950
SOLUTION THAT HELPS PROTECT

11
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,190

((--JAMEY TUCKER REPORTING--))

14
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,920
It's important to protect your

15
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,730
primary email address. Bad

16
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,230
guys can, and do, use email

17
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:28,830
addresses to bombard people

18
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,370
with malware and even steal

19
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,430
identies. You've heard of

20
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,700
burner phones, those phones

21
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,900
used, often by people who want

22
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,840
to hide their tracks. If you

23
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,340
don't like giving away your

24
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,740
email address...you'll love

25
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,250
burner email. You're visiting

26
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,210
a website that offers a

27
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,180
special deal in exchange for

28
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,220
your information, specifically

29
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,920
your email address. Sometimes

30
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,090
you're okay with that, but a

31
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,750
lot of times you don't want to

32
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,590
be bothered, AFTER you get the

33
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,320
special deal. Burner email is

34
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,020
an extension for both the

35
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,690
Chrome and Firefox browser

36
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,890
that creates a secret email

37
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,060
address. Here's how it works:

38
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,860
Install the burner email

39
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,630
extension, you'll find it in

40
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,030
the Chrome Store or as a

41
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,900
Firefox plugin. Now, when

42
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,040
you're asked to sign up for

43
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,470
something, look for the flames

44
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,470
in the signup box...get it,

45
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,880
burner? Click on it and the

46
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,810
extension will create an email

47
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,580
address for that specific

48
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,580
newsletter or site. When the

49
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,180
company sends you one of their

50
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,250
emails, it goes to burner

51
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,220
email first, and gets

52
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,250
forwarded on to you. The

53
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,950
company or website never gets

54
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,650
your primary email address.

55
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,290
You'll get the newsletters for

56
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,860
as long as you want them.

57
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,160
Getting too many, you can turn

58
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,830
it off, or if you're done with

59
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,730
them, delete or burn it the

60
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,530
secret email address. Using a

61
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,470
burner or disposable email

62
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,530
address will protect the one

63
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,000
you use for important things.

64
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,740
