1
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:13,332
 Bonjour !

2
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:14,633
 bon

3
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:16,093
 jour

4
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:18,149
 bonjour !

5
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:21,592
 Bonjour means good morning

6
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:23,612
 Bonjour can be used from morning

7
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:26,923
 till noon (12 pm)

8
00:00:26,923 --> 00:00:27,915
 but

9
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:29,396
 if you want,

10
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,147
 even after 12 pm

11
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:34,717
 i.e., any time of the day

12
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:37,729
 you can use 'bonjour'

13
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:41,059
 just like we use 'namaste' in Hindi 

14
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:42,900
'namaste' can be used in the morning,

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,554
in the evening,

16
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:46,289
even at night

17
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:47,263
 In the same way,

18
00:00:47,263 --> 00:00:50,983
we can also use 'bonjour'

19
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:53,390
 Now a pronunciation tip!

20
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,153
There are two letters in this word

21
00:00:56,153 --> 00:01:00,154
 which are often mispronounced by people

22
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:01,805
 Which are they?

23
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:04,639
 'j' and 'r'

24
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:08,174
 'j' should be pronounced as 'zh'

25
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:09,519
 so

26
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,340
 'bonjour'

27
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:13,833
 'bonjour'

28
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:16,764
 Now you might have noticed

29
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:20,903
 Even 'r' has a different pronunciation in this word

30
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:22,716
 What did I say?

31
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,610
 'bon-joorh'

32
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,460
 The different sound produced by 'r' is

33
00:01:29,528 --> 00:01:30,504
 rh

34
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:31,924
 rh

35
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,924
 rh

36
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:37,152
bonjour

37
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:41,159
You'll get some special notes in this video

38
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,349

39
