to talk about it

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,559
my formula has been a very different

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,239
kind of formula i'll tell you something

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,520
i

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,119
yes my hard work is a lot in my film

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,799
industry i've been working hard since

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,479
last 28 years now i finished about i've

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,479
finished about

36
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,280
130 films

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,520
and

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,400
i've now become a producer since last 10

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
years i've been producing films

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,200
like bhakt

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,840
airlift baby

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,720
special chabis

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,200
and stone and even padman also

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
i always

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,200
wanted to bring you know the most

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,680
important thing of my life has been that

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
i wanted a change every time anybody

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,240
tries to put an image on me

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,799
i have always jumped to some other image

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,240
i never wanted to be in one track

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
because i always think a change is the

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,040
most important thing in anybody's life

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,040
because if the person can change himself

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
he

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,920
he can do many different things like i

56
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,239
started doing romantic films i started

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,360
doing

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,560
i've done

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,440
villains role i've done so many kind of

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,280
different kind of roles i didn't i

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
didn't care about it i just went and

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,680
then changes so i just would like to say

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,280
the changes is the most important thing

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
but on top of that

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,400
i would

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,440
uh bring one thing

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,360
whether you believe it or not

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,400
but this i will share it with you guys

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,319
that

70
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,480
my success

71
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,680
lies

72
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,160
a lot

73
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,080
and my parents feet i'll tell you why

74
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,120
my

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,040
whenever in the morning whenever i go to

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,400
work

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
i always touch my mother's feet and go

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,840
ahead

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,400
trust me

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,920
it is

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,159
it has made so much difference in my

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,440
career in my life i have been saved by

83
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,599
so many people who are

84
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,000
like a lot of negative energies i've

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,360
been saved from

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
but that is the fact

87
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,360
yes obviously the hard work is the most

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,080
important thing change is another thing

89
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,280
but to have a positive aura around you

90
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,920
and that only your parents can bring you

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,319
not even god it's only your parents who

92
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,080
will bring your positive aura around you

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,239
and and care for you

94
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,480
i like to deconstruct when i construct

95
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,560
myself completely then i look at myself

96
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
i want to break it

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,920
i want to break this whole image i want

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,680
to start another construction and build

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,440
another one

100
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,319
this is

101
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,360
uh

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
i would say it is in my mindset this is

103
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,680
what i have followed i never stick to

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,440
one particular image

105
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,599
i just want to just keep on innovating

106
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,959
myself

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,560
undergoing i know i miss i can be

108
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,879
comfortable by just doing

109
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,080
commercial cinemas like a rowdy rathor

110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
or a house full or this kind of films

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,959
but i just want to deconstruct myself

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,400
even when i did 2.0 with rajnee khan sir

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,120
i'm playing a villain's role a lot of

114
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,959
people ask me why do you need to play a

115
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,799
villain's role why not

116
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,759
what is wrong so i just need to d i i'll

117
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,680
i love to deconstruct myself that is it

118
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,199
ma'am sure

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,080
um

120
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,479
so you know i also see that you probably

121
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,560
the complete man of the industry you

122
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,400
know you're so busy you do four movies

123
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,720
as you said and yet you make sure that

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
you always spend time with your family

125
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,960
and you always have time for holidays

126
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,360
and i see startups who just get so

127
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,720
engrossed with their work that they

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,919
completely forget that they have

129
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,680
families back there they have parents

130
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,520
their children their bi

131
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,479
sister

132
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,080
you know how do you make sure that you

133
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,320
balance it out see i'll tell you that is

134
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
why the first thing when i started

135
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,600
talking about it i said the most

136
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,199
important thing is take care of your

137
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,520
family take care of your parents that is

138
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
the most important thing the strength

139
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,840
lies in your family

140
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,360
the positiveness lies in your family

141
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,320
i

142
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,960
i work a lot i work

143
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,720
hell of a lot but it is nothing i divide

144
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,680
my work nothing i all i always take

145
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,080
whatever in my life i want to do i do it

146
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,680
with maths

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,400
i calculate it

148
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,800
i'm doing four films a year

149
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,520
i'm doing about four movies a year

150
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,120
one movie takes about 35 to 40 days

151
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,639
i don't work

152
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,520
i saturday i work only seven to two

153
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,880
two o'clock in the afternoon i'm off

154
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,880
saturday two o'clock onwards i don't

155
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,840
work

156
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,320
sunday i don't work

157
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,479
monday i start working

158
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,600
i work eight hours a day

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,960
but in that eight hours i am on the set

160
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,600
i don't move away from the set i don't

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,759
go sit in my vanity van

162
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,720
i tell my producer my director that i am

163
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,840
here

164
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,520
you make me work

165
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,800
eight hours is good enough

166
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,960
because because after eight hours you

167
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,479
know because i have to be in front of

168
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,639
the camera i have to look good i take

169
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,280
one and a half month of holiday with my

170
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,840
family every year

171
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
i just put the globe in front of my wife

172
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,400
and ask her i worked a lot you tell me

173
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,919
where you want to go

174
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,160
i do that

175
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,600
i

176
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,880
so basically what i'm trying to say is

177
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,400
all you have to do

178
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,919
you have to look at your

179
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,479
family you have to look at your priority

180
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,080
your family is your first priority

181
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,319
this is what i believe and i have always

182
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,880
done it and i would suggest you your

183
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,280
family is your first priority

184
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,440
once the priority is set properly once

185
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,319
they also know you okay my husband or my

186
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,199
father or my or my brother will after

187
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,120
working he will come and he'll spend all

188
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,919
his time here perfectly fine nothing can

189
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,560
go wrong with you guys nothing can go

190
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
it's a tried and tested thing which i

191
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,800
have done it i have even told a lot of

192
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,080
people

193
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,440
in my

194
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,360
in my colleagues i have told them and i

195
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,759
have seen changes coming to them

196
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,360
i love the fact that you said that you

197
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,039
have some extreme discipline and that

198
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,800
you follow it and it's worked for you

199
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,960
bollywood is known to party it's known

200
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,120
it's about fun it's about excitement so

201
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,440
how do you make sure that your entire

202
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,000
teams your your producers your directors

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,919
go actors everybody is in tune with you

204
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,039
they're insane because when they are

205
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,599
working with me the agreement is so

206
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,720
strong

207
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,599
that

208
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,919
they have to come early morning properly

209
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,599
time otherwise the agreement will get

210
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,759
you know

211
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,479
that's a good thing to be in a position

212
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,880
where everybody sort of no it is not

213
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,039
even a small producer can do it it is

214
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,400
not that amazing because if you are

215
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,879
taking a chance and if you i always

216
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,400
believe i i always tell everybody

217
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,080
i am an actor

218
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,319
who's a producers actor

219
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,160
i believe what the producer says i have

220
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,280
to do it

221
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,599
and it is important he is my boss but

222
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,840
yeah some of the cases i myself am the

223
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,240
boss of myself you know one thing i like

224
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,919
about the bollywood industry and i think

225
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,319
which all industries need to learn

226
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,120
is that money cannot be tapping you know

227
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,840
money cannot be taboo you cannot grow

228
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,319
your business or yourself without money

229
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,000
having your businesses your products

230
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,400
making money so you know what i would

231
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,320
want you to message out to startups here

232
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,159
today is that making money is really

233
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,800
important i see money is become somehow

234
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
a third or a four year plan after they

235
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,039
start a business you know making money

236
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,479
is important

237
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,959
i was working i did films for 50 000

238
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,000
rupees

239
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,880
but for i think a long time i must say

240
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,360
for 10 years i worked

241
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
not more than about

242
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,240
10 12 lakh rupees uh a movie

243
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,720
so you're the 10th highest paid star in

244
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,600
the world

245
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,000
so uh

246
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,279
so now

247
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,040
but then

248
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
i worked hard for it

249
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,080
and it is not necessary i mean you don't

250
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,399
have to run behind money first you have

251
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,399
to run behind your product first you

252
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,959
have to run behind the quality first and

253
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,279
after that things will change you will

254
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,880
realize it

255
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,040
and i think that i i have done that like

256
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,440
that so i cannot tell them anywhere in

257
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,839
