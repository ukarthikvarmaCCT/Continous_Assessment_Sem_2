1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,000
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): So, Sadhguru, did
you start participating yoga at a very young

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
age?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,610
Sadhguru: What do you mean, when I was young?

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,610
I'm young, man.

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,639
When I was in the gym, for about seven years,
every day, I could run up a coconut tree.

6
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:10,639
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Who showed you this
path?

7
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,509
Sadhguru: I told you, I've been a worm.

8
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,990
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Maybe you're
like, totally free, free bird and...

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,930
Sadhguru: Hey, bird has bird brain.

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,930
Hmm?

11
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:29,519
I got a human brain (Laughter).

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,380
Instrumental music...

13
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:38,770
Sadhguru: A hungry man has no civilization,
has no morality.

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,990
Is that the world we want to create?

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,710
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Let's talk about
organic farming.

16
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,500
Sadhguru: If the entire country goes into
organic farming, our food production will

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,500
come to twenty-five percent of what it is.

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:55,489
How many people do you think will die out
of that?

19
00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:02,000
Instrumental music...

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:37,001
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Hi, Sadhguru, can
you tell us about the place we are going to?

21
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:39,830
Sadhguru: Ah, we're going to the farm, where
they're doing tree-based agriculture.

22
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,149
Yeah, and you can see how the land has improved
in a... just a few years.

23
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:46,570
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): I see a lot of young
people in the ashram.

24
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,130
Sadhguru: Only young people, only young people.

25
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:54,500
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): From childhood, I
have heard people around me say that yoga

26
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,479
and spirituality are things that you should
pursue after your retirement or towards the

27
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,689
end of your life.

28
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,580
But at the Isha Foundation, I see so many
young people.

29
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,939
What is the reason behind this?

30
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,119
Sadhguru: Spirituality is not when you're
no good for anything.

31
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,119
It's (Laughs)...

32
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,580
At the very beginning of your life you must
do it.

33
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,090
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): But it is often said
that we should live the material part of our

34
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,150
life and explore spirituality at a much later
stage.

35
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,890
Sadhguru: See, that is because of the images
that they've created of spirituality, that

36
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,910
it is something that is anti-life.

37
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:35,280
Tell me, you can...

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:43,580
Anything that you have, let's say, your phone,
or your motorcycle, the more you know about

39
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,040
it, the better you can ride it, isn't it?

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,290
Why is that not true with your life?

41
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,887
The more you know about this human mechanism,
the better you can do it.

42
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:55,250
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Sadhguru, I had one
this one question in my mind for which I could

43
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:01,310
never find an answer was - when I used to
watch Mahabharata, there was a saying that

44
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,010
everything is predestined and nobody can change
what is destined.

45
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,030
(Speaks in Hindi - not transcribed) On the
other hand, they would always say that, "Life

46
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,989
is in your hands, you should always work towards
_____ (Unclear), it is your karma."

47
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:18,069
So, I always find these two things as contradictory.

48
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:20,230
Sadhguru: No, no, no, nobody said that.

49
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,340
This is all losers... losers in life explaining
it like this.

50
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,879
Does Krishna look like a loser?

51
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:35,940
So, in his given context, he's doing everything
possible.

52
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:43,350
Well, a lot of things didn't work out as he
planned, but the thing is, he did his best.

53
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,060
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): So, what do you have
to say about teachings that say that everything

54
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
is predestined?

55
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,310
Sadhguru: See, those things are said by losers
who have nothing to show for their life.

56
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:57,540
You don't want to accept your failures and
do better; you want to explain your failures.

57
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,770
Oh, explain it - you'll never know success
in your life.

58
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,590
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): So, you mean everything
is determined by karma?

59
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,970
Sadhguru: No, no, no.

60
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,750
Karma means it's your action.

61
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,720
Yeah, when you say, "My life is my karma,"
you're saying, "My life is my making."

62
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,580
This is the most dynamic way to exist, but
now people have twisted it and made it, "Aiyyo,

63
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,580
karma."

64
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,840
Karma is not something that you inherit, kand...
ma...

65
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,700
karma is in what you're doing right now.

66
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:37,229
So, what life throws at you is not always
your choice, but what you do with it or how

67
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:39,300
you hit it is your choice.

68
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:47,610
Right now, there is a corner, that is the
way it is, but how you take the corner is

69
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,630
entirely yours.

70
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,720
Let's say somebody goes and crashes in this
corner.

71
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,479
Now, they say, "The corner was difficult."

72
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,479
That's not the point.

73
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,140
You didn't know how to take it, that's all
it is.

74
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,970
That's so with every aspect of life.

75
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,940
That's what karma means, it's your doing.

76
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,300
If you make it, it's you; if you don't make
it, it's you.

77
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,979
This is the only culture which has looked
at life like this.

78
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,009
Everywhere they're saying, "God - he is doing
everything."

79
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:23,130
If God is doing everything, why the hell are
you here?

80
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,800
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): So, Sadhguru, did
you start participating yoga at a very young

81
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
age?

82
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,080
Sadhguru: What do you mean, when I was young?

83
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,720
I'm young, man.

84
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,400
You got old, hmm?

85
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,970
I started my yogic practices when I was eleven,
twelve years of age.

86
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:45,550
And also, by the time I was fourteen, fifteen,
I was in the gym, for about seven years, every

87
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,550
day.

88
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,389
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Besides yoga and
flexibility, did you also do a lot of stuff

89
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:52,699
like weightlifting and strength training and
bodybuilding or going to the gym?

90
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:54,720
Sadhguru: Not that kind of gym.

91
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,150
I made sure that I were (was?) very lithe,
very strong.

92
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,569
I could run up a coconut tree, like that I
was.

93
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:10,650
So... so, for me strength and flexibility
were more important than bulging muscles.

94
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,800
So, I kept myself very fit.

95
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): I also spend a lot
of time in the gym, working on myself.

96
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:27,470
Sadhguru: You don't have to s... you don't
have to say it, I can see it (Laughs).

97
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,340
Instrumental music...

98
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:52,610
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): So, we are here in
this place for...

99
00:06:52,610 --> 00:07:04,560
Sadhguru is going to tell us what is...

100
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Sadhguru: Tree-based agriculture.

101
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Tree-based agriculture.

102
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,450
Sadhguru: And what it does to the soil.

103
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,450
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Yes, for me it is
all same thing because for me...

104
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,450
(Overlapping conversation)...

105
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,729
Sadhguru: Yeah, because you're a A320.

106
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:16,440
You don't know what is soil, what is earth
(Laughs).

107
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,949
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): For me, it is same.

108
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:21,090
Agriculture means trees and plants.

109
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,050
Like, that's what we do in agriculture, right?

110
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,629
We plant trees, but what is tree-based agriculture?

111
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:28,220
Agriculture is all about tree, farming, plants.

112
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,510
Sadhguru: Hmm...

113
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:35,390
See, right now, the important thing is this.

114
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,199
What is happening to India's soil and the
world's soil is this, the organic content

115
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,199
is going away.

116
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,039
Because, year after year, you're taking out
the crop, you're putting lot of pesticide,

117
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,889
you're putting insecticide, you're putting
fertilizer, but no organic content.

118
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:55,830
Why organic content is, this whole process
of life happens because of microbial activity.

119
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,010
Even you, you're a bodybuilder, but sixty
percent, hmm?

120
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,770
Sixty percent of you is just microbes, you
know that?

121
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,099
Only forty percent is genetic material.

122
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,930
Sixty percent is just microbial life within
you.

123
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,479
So, the food that you eat, you cannot even
digest it without their help.

124
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,900
Similarly, here in the soil, whatever nutrients
that are there, the plant really can't take

125
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,900
it just like that.

126
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,669
It has to exchange with the microbes.

127
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:27,009
So, it has to catch carbon from the air, make
it into carbon sugars, pump it here, and trading,

128
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,650
okay, for what it wants.

129
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,200
So, this is a very sophisticated marketplace
in the soil.

130
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,830
A handful of soil has anywhere between seven
to ten billion organisms.

131
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:43,860
So, right now, what we have done is, using
the trees, the green, whatever the material

132
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,030
that is there in terms of leaf, we prune it
and put it back into the soil continuously.

133
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,830
And there are also some animals, with... the
animal waste also go into this.

134
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,830
See, now...

135
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,830
(Overlapping conversation)

136
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,830
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): _____ (Unclear)

137
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,290
Sadhguru: ...it is not...it is not rained
in probably, you know, two, two-and-a-half

138
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,290
months.

139
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,779
But, you will see...

140
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,730
Come, you've never done this probably.

141
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,790
Just dig here, I'm telling you.

142
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,790
Is it wet still?

143
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,790
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Yeah, yeah.

144
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,790
It's wet.

145
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,790
It's wet.

146
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,790
Sadhguru: Look at that.

147
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,790
Look at that.

148
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,790
That's rich soil, all right?

149
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,790
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): The texture is different.

150
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,782
Sadhguru: Because it's always covered like
this -- with leaf.

151
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:18,600
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Is this how it is
supposed to be?

152
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,240
Sadhguru: Yeah, it's good.

153
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,740
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): You don't see...

154
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
when you go to fields, you don't see, covered
with leaves.

155
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,170
Sadhguru: That is because they're killing
it.

156
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,529
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): No, but if the leaves
fall on the ground...

157
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:28,649
Sadhguru: They will sweep it.

158
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:29,860
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): They will sweep it.

159
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
Why?

160
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
Because of the...

161
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Sadhguru: No, because there are no leaves.

162
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,860
Where is the leaf?

163
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,970
There are no trees.

164
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:35,970
You're flying...

165
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,970
Do you...

166
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:37,970
Did you ever fly in India?

167
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:38,970
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Yes, all the time.

168
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,970
Sadhguru: You're flying for a (an?)

169
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,970
Indian airline?

170
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,970
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Yeah, yeah.

171
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,970
Sadhguru: Okay.

172
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,970
So, when you fly, probably for a pilot, you
can't look down.

173
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,970
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): You can't look down.

174
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,570
Sadhguru: If you look down, you will see,
except Western Ghat and northeastern part

175
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,010
of the country, the whole country looks like
a brown desert.

176
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,020
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Even this soil is
different.

177
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,020
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Haan.

178
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
Sadhguru: It's full of life.

179
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,020
(Overlapping conversation)

180
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,020
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Microbes.

181
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,590
Sadhguru: If you increase the organic content
here to eight to ten percent...

182
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,510
Right now, this may be around three to four
percent.

183
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,010
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): This is three to
four percent?

184
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,060
Sadhguru: Yeah, eight to ten percent if you
make it, your irrigation requirement will

185
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,420
come down to thirty percent of what it is
right now.

186
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,850
That is, if you're using hundred liters of
water, thirty liters will do the same job.

187
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,510
If you raise it to twelve to fifteen percent,
ten to fifteen percent of water will do, irrigation.

188
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:25,640
So, just imagine, 84 percent of India's water
is used for agriculture.

189
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,620
If you bring it down to even twenty, twenty-five
percent of what it is, there'll be ample water

190
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,459
for everything.

191
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,620
Right now, we're just plowing the land, leaving
it open.

192
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,770
This is like, peel off the skin, stand in
the sun, you will be screaming.

193
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,880
Land is just screaming.

194
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
People don't hear, that's all.

195
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,830
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): So, you're saying,
only solution is plant more trees?

196
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,279
Sadhguru: No, no, not only trees, there are
many ways to do it.

197
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,279
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Okay.

198
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,240
Sadhguru: The important thing is; the ground
should be... not ripped open with plowing

199
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,399
and left open to the Sun.

200
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,430
Something should be there.

201
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,389
There should be grasses, there should be a
crop.

202
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,860
There should be some photosynthesis happening.

203
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,300
So, this leaf has come, not just from the
trees.

204
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,980
They put cover crops and just chop it and
put it right back here.

205
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,130
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Okay, okay, okay.

206
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,550
Sadhguru: So, with this, the yields have gone
up significantly.

207
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:16,670
For farmers, within, let's say, five to seven
years, many farmers are earning 300 to 800

208
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,120
percent more income.

209
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,130
You must see, this is a small farm, it's a
recent one.

210
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,210
These are all just five, six year olds.

211
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:29,320
You must enter a farm which is ten, fifteen
years old, the water table has come up, soil

212
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,959
organic content has gone up, the nutrient
level in the food has gone up significantly.

213
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,709
They're getting a much better price in the
marketplace.

214
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:40,610
And above all, the farmer is earning 300 to
800 percent more.

215
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,040
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Sadhguru ji, I have
a question.

216
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,720
It used to be, I'm saying, it is supposed
to be eight to ten percent, whatever.

217
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:56,290
We have, by our own way, made it down to three
percent, four percent.

218
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,290
But...

219
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,610
Sadhguru: No, no, not 3 percent, percent...

220
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,699
4 percent.

221
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:08,019
In India, 62 percent of India's soil, organic
content is below 0.5 percent.

222
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,380
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): You're saying agricultural
land or...

223
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,380
Sadhguru: Agricultural land.

224
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,329
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): _____ (Unclear) how
much...

225
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:16,029
Sadhguru: It's gone below 0.5 percent.

226
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:17,900
That means we are on the verge of desertification.

227
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,600
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): How many years we
have?

228
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,050
Sadhguru: According to the UN, in the entire
world, there is only sixty to eighty harvests

229
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,200
left, that is anywhere between forty-five
to sixty years max.

230
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
(Overlapping conversation)

231
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): _____ (Unclear)

232
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,829
Sadhguru: By 2045, it's expected we will be
producing forty percent less food than what

233
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,300
we're doing right now.

234
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:43,070
And our populations will be over 9 billion,
9.2 billion.

235
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,230
That's not a world you want to live in.

236
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,050
Your two children, they will be in that world
if you don't turn it around now.

237
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,930
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): But the question
was, let's say, 200 years back or 300 years

238
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,990
back, the content was okay... for...

239
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,990
Sadhguru: See...

240
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,140
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): ...for farming?

241
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,579
Sadhguru: I'm telling you.

242
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:03,560
Not even that far away, even fifty, sixty
years ago, there was no farm in this country

243
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,720
without trees and animals.

244
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,650
Now, trees are gone, animals are gone.

245
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,650
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): My...

246
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,650
That's my...

247
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,920
My question is, if everybody knows that, (Overlapping
conversation)

248
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Sadhguru: They knew.

249
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): ...that is more beneficial...

250
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
(Overlapping conversation)

251
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
Sadhguru: Not that they know, they knew.

252
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): They knew?

253
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Sadhguru: Now, we've forgotten.

254
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,080
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): But, why have we
forgotten?

255
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
If this is a more...

256
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
better way to...

257
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,100
Sadhguru: See, it's like this.

258
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,730
You're eating good food and you're doing well,
the doctor checks you up and says, "Well,

259
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,810
your calcium is not good enough.

260
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,760
Your vitamin B12 is not good enough, your
iron is not good enough" and gives you three

261
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,950
pills for a month, two months, six months,
something.

262
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,459
You took these pills and you felt really good.

263
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:42,639
Then you decided, I don't really have to eat.

264
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,639
It...

265
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,639
I just have to multiply the pills.

266
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,880
Instead of three, I will take thirty pills.

267
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,160
That's what we did to the land.

268
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,440
We put little fertilizer, everything burst
out.

269
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,360
We thought this is it.

270
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,889
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Yes.

271
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:57,560
Sadhguru: And farmers were advise... advised
like this.

272
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,670
Speaker: That's true.

273
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,600
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Everything that happened
during the Green Revolution?

274
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,949
Sadhguru: Yes, it did.

275
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:06,940
But, we must also understand and appreciate
why that was done.

276
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,970
See, India was a country which was suffering
with famines.

277
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,269
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Yes, yes, yes.

278
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:12,779
Sadhguru: Millions of people used to die.

279
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,240
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): We were importing...
we were importing wheat.

280
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,399
Sadhguru: Not only that.

281
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,209
Every other year there was famine.

282
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:18,209
Okay?

283
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:24,230
So, famines means, in 1942 famine, over three...
three million people died.

284
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,910
So, this used to be the reality of this country.

285
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,980
To offset that, to bridge that somehow, then
we went into Green Revolution.

286
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,420
So, it is like you're unwell, you took some
pills, and you got well.

287
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,140
But, then you should have improved your nourishment.

288
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,389
But, you just started taking only pills, thinking
it will make you well.

289
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:44,600
Those same pills are making you sick now.

290
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,589
So, we are not against fertilizer, not against
pesticide, not against anything.

291
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:54,889
The important thing is, organic content should
be there because, first thing is, right now

292
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:57,709
we are consuming the soil of the unborn child.

293
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:58,930
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Yes.

294
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,130
Sadhguru: We're eating up the future's soil.

295
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,389
So, putting life back into this is the most
important thing.

296
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,389
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): No.

297
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:07,380
I read somewhere that you should leave the
planet, if not better...

298
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,000
Sadhguru: At least the way...

299
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
(Overlapping conversation)

300
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,520
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): ...in the same way...

301
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,420
Sadhguru: ...at least the way it came to you.

302
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:19,220
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): ...it came to you,
or you received it from your ancestors.

303
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,220
But we are degrading the planet and then giving
it to our...

304
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,529
Sadhguru: Super degrading it.

305
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:22,529
I'm saying, just imagine.

306
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:23,529
Just imagine.

307
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:24,610
Where are you from?

308
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,610
Where you live?

309
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,610
Mumbai?

310
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,019
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): No, Delhi.

311
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,019
Sadhguru: Delhi.

312
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,019
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Delhi, Kanpur.

313
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,170
Sadhguru: Okay, Delhi, Kanpur, wherever.

314
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,220
In your city, suppose, forty percent less
food is available in the shop.

315
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,850
Not that you don't have money to buy, there
is no food, forty percent less food.

316
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,410
That means forty percent of the people are
not eating enough, or they have no food to

317
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,410
eat.

318
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,769
What do you think will happen to your city?

319
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:50,420
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Chaos.

320
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,540
Sadhguru: What kind of chaos do you think?

321
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,579
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): The poor will die,
they will not get food.

322
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,579
Sadhguru: Really?

323
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:57,579
You think they'll die?

324
00:15:57,579 --> 00:15:58,579
No, no.

325
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:01,440
When they see you, a well-built guy like you,
they'll slaughter you.

326
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,740
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Yeah.

327
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,730
Sadhguru: That's not the way it's going to
happen.

328
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:11,880
A hungry man has no civilization, has no morality,
has no humanity left in him, isn't it?

329
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,730
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): _____ (Unclear)

330
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,400
Sadhguru: We'll... we'll push the world in
that direction.

331
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,730
Today, UN agencies are predicting, by 2035,
there'll be dozens of civil wars in the world.

332
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,440
Is that the world we want to create?

333
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,230
But right now, if we act, we can turn this
around in the next twelve to fifteen years'

334
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,230
time.

335
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,230
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Another question.

336
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,230
I was working on this project of rainwater
harvesting.

337
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,230
I went around with Jal boards of different
cities.

338
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,230
But then there's a problem.

339
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,230
Sadhguru.

340
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:40,050
See, my videos are watched by people around
twenty-five to thirty years of age.

341
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:49,870
Now, the best solution I could give them was,
it was costing them 50 to 55000 rupees to

342
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,339
build a system for rainwater harvesting on
their roof so that you can replenish.

343
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:57,959
But then they're saying ki, we don't have
50000 rupees to spend.

344
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:02,459
The problem, why it fails...

345
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,699
We make a video, people watch it, yes, there's
a problem.

346
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:06,079
They will say Sadhguru ji is right.

347
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,630
Sadhguru: No, no, no, I don't give such...

348
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,630
(Overlapping conversation)

349
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,630
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): But... but...

350
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,630
Sadhguru: I don't give that kind of solutions
ever.

351
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,630
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): So, what...

352
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,630
what...

353
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,800
Sadhguru: Here I'm saying, this is not an
ecological plan for the farmer.

354
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,549
For the farmer, this is an economic plan.

355
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:20,299
But it has an ecological impact.

356
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:25,049
So, everything ecological we do is like this;
it's an economic plan.

357
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:28,850
Because if it's not an economic plan, it'll
anyway not succeed.

358
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,850
Okay?

359
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,120
They must make money out of it, then only
it'll succeed, and then only it'll sustain.

360
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,910
Okay, even if I had 50000... 55000, or 1 lakh
rupees, I spent it today.

361
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,910
Will I spend it every year?

362
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,910
Whatever is needed?

363
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:40,910
No.

364
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:46,780
It can only sustain if this becomes economically
very good for me, isn't it?

365
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,890
So, this is about marrying economy and ecology.

366
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,030
Otherwise, there will be no success at all.

367
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,549
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): So, you're saying,
farmers who are on the ground, working on

368
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:02,100
their fields, they should bring this change
or a government policy change?

369
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
(Overlapping conversation)

370
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Sadhguru: No, no, no.

371
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Policy change is a must.

372
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,930
Because, see, today, this farm is good.

373
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,870
This is one generation of people.

374
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,299
Because we have worked with them, they've
made their farms like this.

375
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:17,540
But let's say, next generation comes, they
may do their own thing.

376
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:23,130
For you to see an example, for example, you
live in Delhi, the New Delhi is built in a

377
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,280
certain way.

378
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:30,350
Because if you have, let us say, 10000 square
feet of land, you can't build a 10000 square

379
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,350
foot building.

380
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,669
You build 6, 7000, allow some space for yourself,
your neighbor.

381
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:35,890
This is the law.

382
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:36,890
You cannot do it.

383
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,280
If you do more, they'll come and knock it
down.

384
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,419
But just go to Old Delhi and see, there's
no concept of a window.

385
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:44,419
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Mhmm... mhmm... mhmm...
mhmm (Indicating agreement)

386
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:46,330
Sadhguru: One door entry, one door out.

387
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:50,679
All sides, there are more homes, there is
no possibility of a window.

388
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:52,070
All right?

389
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,539
Is that the way to build a building?

390
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:55,770
That happened when there was no law.

391
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:01,800
So, right now, if you have twenty-five acres
of land, you can plow every inch of it and

392
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,090
turn it into a desert in the next ten, fifteen
years' time.

393
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,559
Nobody will ask you, "Why are you doing such
a damaging thing?"

394
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,310
Because there's no law.

395
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:15,150
We need a law, that if you own agricultural
land, you must have minimum three to six percent,

396
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,419
this is minimum to keep the soil alive.

397
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:19,450
If you don't live well, that's up to you.

398
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,510
But you can't snatch away life from future
generations, right now.

399
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,530
Because once soil is gone, there's no life
left.

400
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:31,460
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): But Sadhguru
ji, In that case farmers would say that, you

401
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,809
know, they will earn less, they're already
earning less.

402
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:37,169
Sadhguru: Arrey, I'm telling you, they're
earning 300 to 800 percent more.

403
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:39,620
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Mhmm (Indicating
agreement)

404
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,860
Sadhguru: This is wrong education that we've
given them, right?

405
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,340
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Mhmm, (Indicating
agreement) right.

406
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,130
Sadhguru: Tell me if the soil is rich, will
you earn less or more?

407
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,130
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): More.

408
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,130
Sadhguru: If the soil is rich, will you commit
suicide?

409
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,660
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): No.

410
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,860
Sadhguru: 300000 farmers have committed suicide
in India.

411
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,860
Speaker(Ritu Rathee Taneja) : Mhmm (Indicating
agreement)

412
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,090
Sadhguru: If the soil was rich, even if they
don't have money, if they can grow food for

413
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,390
himself and his family, will he kill himself?

414
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,740
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): No

415
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,940
Sadhguru: Then why are we not looking at it?

416
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:11,220
In United States today, in the last twelve
years, fifty percent of the farmers have not

417
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,220
seen a single dollar.

418
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
Okay?

419
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,410
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Mhmm (Indicating
agreement)

420
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,220
Sadhguru: And the highest suicide rate among
all professions is among the farming community.

421
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,650
It's not just in India.

422
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,780
This is because there is no strength in the
soil.

423
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:30,380
Your costs are going on because every year
you have to keep on increasing the dosage...

424
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,380
(Overlapping conversation)

425
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,380
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Yeah, yeah, yeah.

426
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,380
Sadhguru: ...of fertilizer and everything
else.

427
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,789
So, costs are just rising by the year, they're
not able to ta... bear that.

428
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:41,210
Otherwise, if you raise the food prices, other
people will complain, because... inflation,

429
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,910
they can't handle it.

430
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,940
So, the important thing is, soil has to be
rich.

431
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:52,669
Soil should be alive, because first twelve
to fifteen inches of soil is the source for

432
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,330
eighty-seven percent of life on this planet.

433
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,010
When you're born, you come out of it; when
you live, you eat out of it; when you die,

434
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,010
you go back to it.

435
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,010
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Mhmm (Indicating
agreement)

436
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,410
Sadhguru: This is the only magical place in
the universe -- not on the planet -- where,

437
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,809
if you sow death into it, it bursts out with
life.

438
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,841
Tell me one other place like this.

439
00:21:09,841 --> 00:21:10,841
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Mhmm (Indicating
agreement)

440
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:11,841
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Mhmm (Indicating
agreement)

441
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:12,841
Sadhguru: Let's make it happen.

442
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:13,841
Save Soil.

443
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:15,080
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): But this is going
to take at least two to three years of transition

444
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,200
period where farmers will earn less because...

445
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,539
Sadhguru: No, no, why?

446
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:19,549
Why are you...

447
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:23,909
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Straight away from
the next harvest they will earn more?

448
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:26,990
Sadhguru: See, because in your head it is
stuck, you must do organic farming.

449
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,420
This organic farming is a crime committed
by urban people.

450
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,159
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Let's talk about
organic farming because...

451
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,159
(Overlapping conversation)

452
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,159
Sadhguru: No, no.

453
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,159
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): ...we pay so much
to get organic foods.

454
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:38,159
Sadhguru: No, no.

455
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,159
I'm not saying it's not good.

456
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,090
I am saying, you never worked on the land.

457
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,460
So, suddenly you declare, "Organic farming."

458
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,169
Right now, if the entire country goes into
organic farming, without fertilizer, without

459
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:52,450
pesticide, without any of those things, our
food production will come to twenty-five percent

460
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,500
of what it is.

461
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,289
How many people do you think will die out
of that?

462
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:59,600
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Sadhguru, that's
what exactly I want to ask ki, how to bring

463
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
this change?

464
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Sadhguru:.

465
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,620
I'm telling you, institute it in the policy,
first.

466
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,620
If you...

467
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,909
Like, in the city, there is a law.

468
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:10,900
If you build a house, there must be so much
ventilation, so much space, whatever.

469
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,409
Similarly, if you own an agricultural land,
minimum three to six percent organic content

470
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:16,409
should be there.

471
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:17,409
Speaker: Mhmm (Indicating agreement)

472
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:21,650
Sadhguru: If that is there, you will use a
certain amount of chemicals and stuff to grow.

473
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,150
But, if you increase the organic content to,
let's say, six percent to eight percent or

474
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:29,850
ten percent, then your fertilizer and everything
will come down, your input cost will come

475
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,850
down.

476
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,450
Well, you may take two, three years to make
this re...

477
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,510
enrichment.

478
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,940
But that also can be offset very quickly,
within a year you can do it.

479
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,460
If the government is willing to give some
subsidy for enrichment of soil, you understand?

480
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,630
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Right.

481
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,980
Sadhguru: See, in Tamil Nadu, we promoted
this in the last twenty-four, twenty-five

482
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:53,049
years, I've been telling the farmers, ten
percent of your land should be trees, which

483
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:56,070
will provide foliage for the remaining ninety
percent.

484
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,070
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Mhmm (Indicating
agreement)

485
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,020
Sadhguru: If you don't invest that ten percent,
then everything will die.

486
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,750
Now, if you invest that ten percent, you think
you're earning less?

487
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,750
No.

488
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,539
In the remaining ninety percent, you earn
much more than what you were earning with

489
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:12,140
full hundred percent.

490
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,650
But we are not saying, "Don't use fertilizer."

491
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:19,929
As the soil becomes richer, the use of fertilizer
will naturally go down.

492
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:20,929
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Right.

493
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:22,790
Sadhguru: So, we are not "anti" anything.

494
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,790
Okay?

495
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:26,200
This is not "Don't use fertilizer, don't do..."

496
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,150
These are things are said by urban people
who have never done farming.

497
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,000
Farming is a heartbreaking job.

498
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,409
Once there is no necessary, you know, inputs
to do that.

499
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:41,440
See, you don't have to do agriculture like
it's some kind of philosophy or a religion.

500
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,250
This is not what you believe in.

501
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,150
This is about making a practical solution
out of this.

502
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,150
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Right.

503
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,830
Sadhguru: I'm just saying don't cut the golden
goose.

504
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,540
If I have to say it very simply, wait for
the eggs to come (Laughs).

505
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,610
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): But, it's scary to
listen to the timelines what you have told

506
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,610
us.

507
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,610
2035 will be desert...

508
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,610
(Overlapping conversation)

509
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,919
Sadhguru: See, right now, we are partnering
with UN CCD.

510
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,410
That's a agency, UN agency for combating desertification.

511
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,550
Desertification is the biggest problem in
the planet right now.

512
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:16,100
Nobody's talking about it because there's
no money in it.

513
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,279
Everybody's talking about fossil fuels, automobiles,
coal, this one, that one because if you knock

514
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,140
industry, it spills dollars.

515
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,309
Here, you can't go and knock anybody, you
have to spend your life to make it happen.

516
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:29,350
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Exactly.

517
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:35,360
Sadhguru: To convert about 125000 farmers
to... to tree-based agriculture in Tamil Nadu

518
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,190
and Karnataka, twenty-five years of our life
is gone in this.

519
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,260
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): With no reward.

520
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,570
Sadhguru: Not that there is no reward.

521
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,870
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): No, to the people
who are volunteering.

522
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,920
Sadhguru: No, they don't look for a reward.

523
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,030
They want to do it.

524
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,809
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Mhmm (Indicating
agreement)

525
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:50,809
Sadhguru: What's a reward?

526
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:52,820
We're alive, and we're happy, that's a reward
(Laughs).

527
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,850
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Mhmm (Indicating
agreement) True.

528
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,370
Sadhguru: What other reward is there in life?

529
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,730
You want a crown (Laughs)?

530
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:04,679
Very uncomfortable, damn thing to wear, just
know that (Laughter).

531
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,590
Can you imagine a metal ring on your head?

532
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,950
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): I always used to
wonder, that... in our epic...

533
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,669
Sadhguru: It's a terrible thing to wear (Laughs).

534
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:13,340
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): It is shown, it is
of gold.

535
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,720
Sadhguru: See, right now, you're wearing a
helmet, it's properly cushioned, everything,

536
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,070
that only irritates you after some time.

537
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,200
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): After some time,
_____ (Unclear)

538
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,570
Sadhguru: Just a metal ring... metal ring,
you put it on your head and walk around.

539
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,140
That's the silliest thing to do.

540
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,159
So, we're not looking for a crown (Laughs).

541
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,980
Rich with life, it's reverberating.

542
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,970
The land, that's how it should be.

543
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,980
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Mhmm (Indicating
agreement)

544
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,500
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Sadhguru ji, where
do you do so much research?

545
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,780
Do you read?

546
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,159
Sadhguru: No, no, I don't do any research.

547
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:42,159
(Overlapping conversation)

548
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,159
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): You have a lot of...

549
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:45,250
I'm not talking about what you tell about
spirituality, life.

550
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,250
But...

551
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,250
Sadhguru: Even the soil...

552
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,250
(Overlapping conversation)

553
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,250
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): But this soil, tree,
seeds...

554
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,460
Sadhguru: ...this is because you know, for
six and a half decades, I have lived on this

555
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,429
planet.

556
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:56,339
Others don't live on this planet, they live
in their head.

557
00:25:56,339 --> 00:25:57,590
I don't have anything in my head.

558
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,610
So, I live on the planet.

559
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,130
I'm like a worm.

560
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:04,380
You ask a worm, it knows what is the soil
condition, isn't it?

561
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,940
Do you think the worm in this soil knows more
about this soil than a scientist?

562
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,960
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): But it cannot tell
us.

563
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,920
Sadhguru: No, this worm can speak.

564
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,170
That's the only difference (Laughter).

565
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,170
That worm also speaks, you're not understanding
the language.

566
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:23,559
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Yes, maybe (Sadhguru
laughs).

567
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:33,309
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): But, it is strange
to see that what is affecting our life, what

568
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:34,309
is affecting our children, we are not...

569
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:35,309
Because nobody...

570
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:36,309
Sadhguru: See...

571
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:37,309
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Even when I heard
about, I was talking to swami ji.

572
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:38,309
He told me about all that.

573
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:44,320
Desert... it's going to turn to desert and
the fruits and the vegetables itself, if the

574
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,650
soil doesn't have any nutrition...

575
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,650
(Overlapping conversation)

576
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,850
Sadhguru: It has nothing.

577
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,399
See, right now it's a fashion to eat salads
in America.

578
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:51,750
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): No, even in India.

579
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,750
Sadhguru: But for example...

580
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,750
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): I eat salads.

581
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,750
Sadhguru: All right.

582
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,750
You?

583
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,750
You eat salad?

584
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,790
You've been eating a buffalo (Laughs).

585
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:04,140
So, in California especially, it's very fashionable.

586
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,860
But one important item...

587
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,970
This is the only thing which has been studied.

588
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,750
If you study everything, it'll all come out.

589
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,950
Lettuce, for example.

590
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,540
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Okay.

591
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,679
Sadhguru: It has only ten percent of the nutrition
it had hundred years ago.

592
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:22,220
In 1920, if you ate it, what you got, today
you're getting ninety percent less.

593
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,890
You're eating trash.

594
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,169
This is what we've done to our food.

595
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:30,820
If you ate one orange in 1920, today you will
have to eat eight oranges to get the same

596
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,159
thing.

597
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,350
Can you eat eight oranges?

598
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,350
Even you can't eat.

599
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,350
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): But then people in
1920 must be starving.

600
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,350
You can't...

601
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:43,970
The amount of food you eat, amount of space
you have in the stomach, you need...

602
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:49,470
Sadhguru: No, if the food is rich, you don't
need that much quantity.

603
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,399
Right now, people are eating much more than
what they should eat because it lacks nourishment.

604
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:57,370
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): I thought it is because
of the volume, it satisfies the hunger.

605
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,279
Sadhguru: No, no, that is also there.

606
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:05,780
See, what level of activity - physical activity
-- people were putting in 1920, and what level

607
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,260
of activity you're putting now is not even
ten percent.

608
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,480
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Right.

609
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,610
Sadhguru: Everything had to be done with your
body.

610
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,610
All right?

611
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,330
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Now we have machinery.

612
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:19,020
Sadhguru: So, we can think, it's like, you
know, in the petrol.

613
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:25,270
Whether you want to ride with a hundred octane,
or you want to ride with fifty octane, it's

614
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,019
a big difference (Laughs).

615
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:30,299
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): So, you know
what happened, Sadhguru?

616
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:34,140
One day, I was flying with another captain,
even I'm a captain.

617
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,370
Sadhguru: Oh, you're also a pilot?

618
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,149
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Yes, I'm also
a pilot.

619
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:40,149
I'm with Indigo airline.

620
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:42,440
So, he told me about you.

621
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,690
And one day, I was on layover and then I actually
tried to do Isha Kriya.

622
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,380
Although I failed at it, but yes.

623
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,309
Then I started following your videos and your
ideology.

624
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:53,309
So...

625
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:54,309
Sadhguru: Hey, I have no ideology.

626
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:56,960
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Not exactly
ideology, but...

627
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Sadhguru: Simply, life sense.

628
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,950
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Haanji, life
sense.

629
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,100
But yes, like...

630
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,260
my father tells me this every time.

631
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:13,390
See, like... as a child needs a teacher to,
you know, guide in a certain way, my father

632
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,750
told me that a person needs somebody.

633
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,909
I mean, like, for me, it's you.

634
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:21,390
Sadhguru: See, flying an airplane, it's such
a simple, damn thing.

635
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,160
If you just pull it, it will fly.

636
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,960
But, if there was no trainer, you think you
would have?

637
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,220
You'd be dead, probably.

638
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,220
Isn't it (Laughs)?

639
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,739
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): Exactly.

640
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:31,419
That's what my father tells me.

641
00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:33,240
Sadhguru: Any unknown terrain, if you want
to walk...

642
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,081
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Sadhguru ji, question
comes that, okay, so many people follow you.

643
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:37,081
You are the trainer who shows them the path.

644
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:38,081
Who showed you this path?

645
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:40,860
Sadhguru: I told you, I've been a worm.

646
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,740
I've lived on this planet, absorbed life.

647
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,860
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): No, but I've seen
so many of his videos.

648
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,130
He never answers this question (Ritu Rathee
Taneja laughs).

649
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,410
Sadhguru: Do I look like I was trained by
somebody?

650
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,570
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): No, I don't know.

651
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,570
I'm asking.

652
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,590
Sadhguru: No, no, just tell me, looking at
me (Laughs).

653
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,870
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): I didn't feel
like.

654
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:02,780
I feel like, that maybe, you're like... totally
free, free bird and...

655
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,299
Sadhguru: Hey, bird has bird brain (Ritu Rathee
Taneja laughs).

656
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:06,299
Don't tell... call me a bird.

657
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:07,299
Hmm?

658
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:09,430
I got a human brain (Laughter).

659
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,770
Instrumental music...

660
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:18,770
Speaker (Ritu Rathee Taneja): (Speaks in Hindi
- not transcribed) It's very sweet.

661
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,110
Sadhguru: Yes.

662
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,450
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Because the soil
has micro...

663
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,780
microorganisms, right?

664
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,880
It has more nutrition?

665
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,620
Sadhguru: Definitely, it has.

666
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,620
Really.

667
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:37,570
Those neat looking agricultural lands, lines
and lines, they are not good lands.

668
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,669
Unfortunately, we've advertised like that
-- that's how land should look.

669
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:44,030
No, this is how it should look - full of vegetation.

670
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,030
Instrumental music...

671
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:53,500
Sadhguru: Farmer is living a quiet, nice life,
with a house, family, settled.

672
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,620
Both his children are well-educated now.

673
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,179
All from the farm.

674
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:03,539
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): But Sadhguru ji you
know, she is from Haryana, a farming background.

675
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:06,529
But, the main problem is, everyone is sending
their kids to cities.

676
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:08,049
They don't want them to be farmers.

677
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:09,049
Sadhguru: Unfortunately, yeah.

678
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:10,049
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Even a... for...

679
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:16,649
Sadhguru: We have made some kind of a rudimentary
survey.

680
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:19,880
Not even two percent of the farmers want their
children to become farmers.

681
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,870
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): And even for... they
want...

682
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,870
Sadhguru: Yes...

683
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,860
That is a thing, just imagine in twenty-five
years, if this generation passes, where is

684
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,140
the food security for this country?

685
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,610
Speaker (Gaurav Taneja): Are you taking the
same bike, to ride in Europe?

686
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,770
Sadhguru: Europe, I'm riding a GT 1600.

687
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,120
Arabia, I'm riding this.

688
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,160
From Tel Aviv to Oman, I'm riding this.

689
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
Instrumental music...

690
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,169
Sounds of Isha music - Soil Song Lalale Lale
Lale...
