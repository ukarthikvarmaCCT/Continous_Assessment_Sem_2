1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,055
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,055 --> 00:00:02,702
In the history of Pakistan,

3
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:04,882
none of their Prime Ministers

4
00:00:05,207 --> 00:00:07,922
completed the full 5-year term.

5
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:10,688
When Imran Khan became the Prime Minister, people believed

6
00:00:10,688 --> 00:00:14,264
that he would be the first Prime Minister to complete his term.

7
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,603
But it didn't happen.

8
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:17,979
Imran Khan's government has now fallen.

9
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:19,250
How?

10
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,769
What's the story behind it?

11
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:21,949
It's quite interesting.

12
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,421
Come, let's get to know it,
in today's video.

13
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:26,442
"Pakistan's Prime Minister, the former cricketer Imran Khan,

14
00:00:26,738 --> 00:00:28,513
has been ousted from power

15
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:30,916
after losing the vote of No-Confidence in Parliament."

16
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:35,404
"74 members have recorded a vote in favour of the resolution.

17
00:00:35,404 --> 00:00:37,452
It has been passed by a majority

18
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:40,065
of the total membership of the National Assembly."

19
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:44,358
"Meanwhile, Imran Khan has accused the US,

20
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:47,897
of conspiring to topple him over his ties with Russia and China."

21
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,939
Let's start at the beginning. 

22
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,177
While India had the General Elections in 2019,

23
00:00:57,177 --> 00:01:01,444
Pakistan had their General Elections the year before, in 2018.

24
00:01:01,444 --> 00:01:05,486
Traditionally, there have been 2 main parties in India for a long time, Congress and BJP.

25
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:08,171
In Pakistan's 2018 General Elections,

26
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:09,544
two traditional parties faced off.

27
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:11,006
PMLN.

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,284
With Nawaz Sharif's brother Shehbaz Sharif at the helm.

29
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:18,958
And PPP.

30
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:22,983
With Bilawal Bhutto Zardari heading it.

31
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:26,109
Along with them, there was a third contesting party.

32
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:27,232
PTI.

33
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,640
The name means 'Movement for Justice.'

34
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,878
And this party was being led by Imran Khan.

35
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:37,277
Imran Khan is a famous Pakistani cricketer,

36
00:01:37,277 --> 00:01:40,865
he led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

37
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,473
The only World Cup won by Pakistan till now.

38
00:01:44,473 --> 00:01:47,869
If you look at Pakistan's political situation in 2018,

39
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:50,669
Imran Khan was being said to be a new hope.

40
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:55,184
The two traditional parties were accused of nepotism and corruption.

41
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:57,826
PPP's chief, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari,

42
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,513
is the son of the former PM Benazir Bhutto,

43
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:02,855
and the former President Asif Ali Zardari.

44
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:08,554
And Benazir Bhutto is the daughter of the former PM, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.

45
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:11,735
On the other hand, PMLN Party's image was tainted with accusations of corruption.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,049
In 2017, Nawaz Sharif was removed from the post of PM.

47
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,895
By the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

48
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:21,183
There were allegations of corruption against him after the Panama Paper leak.

49
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,137
And there were several other corruption cases too.

50
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:27,957
In July 2018, he was sentenced to 10-years in jail,

51
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:30,784
on the charges of purchase of upscale apartments in London.

52
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,589
Six months later, he was again sentenced to 7-years' imprisonment 

53
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:34,831
and a fine of $25 million,

54
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:40,547
because he couldn't prove how he got the ownership of a steel mill in Saudi Arabia.

55
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:43,186
In the midst of such news, was Imran Khan.

56
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:45,299
He asked the people to vote for him,

57
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,765
and he promised that there would be no corruption and no nepotism.

58
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:51,712
For many people, Imran Khan came across as the last hope for Pakistan.

59
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:54,136
At the same time, he had some critics too.

60
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:56,823
Imran Khan is an Oxford graduate,

61
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:58,580
he played international cricket,

62
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,728
has had 3 love marriages.

63
00:02:59,728 --> 00:03:04,076
The first was with a British Jewish billionaire's daughter.

64
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:05,713
An inter-religious marriage.

65
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:08,798
After hearing this, you'd assume that he's very open-minded,

66
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:10,663
that he'd be a secular, liberal person.

67
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:11,742
Not quite.

68
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:15,687
Imran Khan was asked if he supports the rights of Ahmadi Muslims,

69
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:18,408
he answered that he doesn't consider the Ahmadis to be Muslims.

70
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,902
That he considers them non-Muslims.

71
00:03:20,902 --> 00:03:22,821
In case you don't know, Ahmadi Muslims,

72
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:25,758
consider Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be a prophet.

73
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:30,282
"A person who doesn't believe our Prophet to be the last Prophet,

74
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:31,584
he isn't a Muslim.

75
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:34,306
That's why, saying that

76
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:37,897
I'm being discriminatory against them,

77
00:03:37,897 --> 00:03:41,475
and trying to change the provisions of the Constitution,

78
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:43,764
is a total lie, it's propaganda."

79
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:49,186
And, in his election campaigns, he had heavily defended Pakistan's blasphemy laws. 

80
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,331
Pakistan's Article 295C,

81
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,278
provides for a death penalty for those who

82
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:56,069
malign Prophet Mohammed.

83
00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:01,111
Imran Khan used right-wing jingoistic nationalism too. 

84
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:03,314
Nationalism is loving one's country.

85
00:04:03,314 --> 00:04:05,443
Jingoistic Nationalism is when

86
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:07,913
one starts hating other countries.

87
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:10,233
Indian media uses this a lot.

88
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:14,863
And in the 2018 campaigns, Imran Khan's party used such slogans too.

89
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:16,767
"Modi sympathisers are traitors"

90
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,067
They even claimed that international establishments and India

91
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:24,861
were working together to ensure victory for Sharif's party.

92
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:27,389
It's the same as when some political parties in India

93
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,414
accuse other political parties

94
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:31,610
as being supported by Pakistan.

95
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,318
That they're controlled by Pakistan.

96
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:35,202
Anyway, despite all of this,

97
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:37,000
in the 2018 General Elections,

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,517
Imran Khan's party PTI, was #1.

99
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:41,380
They won 155 seats.

100
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,929
4 times more than they won in the previous elections in 2013.

101
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:46,532
Amazing performance.

102
00:04:46,532 --> 00:04:48,413
Because of corruption and nepotism,

103
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,146
both traditional parties lost terribly.

104
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:54,338
Shahbaz Sharif's PMLN won 84 seats,

105
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:57,911
and on the 3rd spot was Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's PPP.

106
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,126
With 56 seats.

107
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:02,639
These details are important to understanding the current political crisis.

108
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,914
So there are 342 seats in Pakistan's National Assembly in total.

109
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:10,225
So the majority mark is 172.

110
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:15,583
Despite being the #1 party, PTI couldn't cross the 172 mark.

111
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,410
They had only 155 seats.

112
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,654
Imran Khan formed a collation with some small parties and independent parties,

113
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,993
and with their help, he could get 178 seats.

114
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:26,973
Doing so helped him form a government,

115
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:29,956
but he was only slightly beyond the majority mark.

116
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:32,302
Only 6 seats more than the majority mark.

117
00:05:32,302 --> 00:05:34,525
It wasn't a strong government.

118
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,868
And so we come to the present scenario.

119
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:39,512
On 8th March, about a month ago,

120
00:05:39,512 --> 00:05:41,697
the senior leaders of the opposition parties,

121
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:43,783
presented to the National Assembly,

122
00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:47,245
their demand for a No-Confidence vote against Imran Khan.

123
00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:49,384
The thing is that, over the last few years,

124
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:53,404
almost all opposition parties in Pakistan have joined forces.

125
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:55,231
They created an alliance

126
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:58,363
called the Pakistan Democratic Movement. (PDM)

127
00:05:58,363 --> 00:06:00,519
This alliance is a catch-all collation.

128
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,771
There are no set ideologies of this alliance. 

129
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:04,613
It has parties of all kinds.

130
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:06,810
From the left wing to the extreme right wing.

131
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,992
Secular parties like Balochistan National Party and National Party,

132
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:13,641
And parties like Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and Jamiat Ahle Hadith

133
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:16,290
such religious conservative parties too.

134
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,450
Also, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party

135
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,500
a party that talks about Marxism and democratic socialism.

136
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,973
And parties like Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz)

137
00:06:24,973 --> 00:06:27,857
who talk about free-market capitalism.

138
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:29,030
They're all in it.

139
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,066
This alliance began joint opposition rallies about 1.5 years ago,

140
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:34,514
and raised the issues of the people.

141
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:38,541
They talked about problems that Pakistan faces even today.

142
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:41,526
Nawaz Sharif's daughter, Mariyam Nawaz, addressed the rallies,

143
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,802
saying that Imran Khan has taken away jobs from the people.

144
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:46,054
People don't even have food to last them 2 days.

145
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,843
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Pakistan's farmers are starving.

146
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,858
And the youth of the country is furious.

147
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:55,080
There were large crowds at these rallies.

148
00:06:55,258 --> 00:06:59,790
Overall, inflation, unemployment, power cuts, businesses closing down,

149
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,407
were the issues used by the opposition against Imran Khan.

150
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:06,549
And so, we get to March 2021.

151
00:07:06,549 --> 00:07:09,630
Pakistan's Finance Minister, Abdul Hafiz Sheikh,

152
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,956
contested elections for the Senate.

153
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:13,871
There's a Senate in Pakistan,

154
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:16,631
it is equivalent to India's Rajya Sabha.

155
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:20,733
But there are some differences between India's and Pakistan's legislative structures.

156
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:25,479
The National Assembly votes for the elections to the Senate.

157
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,257
And Pakistan's National Assembly is equivalent to India's Lok Sabha.

158
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:33,025
Abdul Hafiz Sheikh lost his Senate seat

159
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:35,297
even though Imran Khan campaigned for him.

160
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:38,255
It was won by the PDM candidate

161
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:40,006
Yusuf Raza Ghilani,

162
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:42,402
a former Prime Minister of Pakistan.

163
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:45,395
This was a major shock to Imran Khan's government.

164
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:48,108
The Finance Minister of the government lost the elections,

165
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,054
even though PM Imran Khan was campaigning for him.

166
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:54,376
The opposition used this to ask Imran Khan to resign.

167
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:57,159
Because Imran Khan had lost the confidence of the National Assembly.

168
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:01,563
Seeing this happen, Imran Khan called for a Voluntary Vote of Confidence.

169
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:04,073
He asked the Parliament to vote

170
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:07,319
to see if his government should continue to be in power or not.

171
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,072
Whether a majority of the MNAs,
Members of the National Assembly,

172
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,729
support him or not.

173
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:14,533
In India, we refer to them as MPs,
Members of Parliament.

174
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:17,531
While they call them MNAs,
Members of National Assembly. 

175
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,922
This was the second time in Pakistan's history,

176
00:08:19,922 --> 00:08:23,777
when a Prime Minister asked for a vote of confidence in the National Assembly.

177
00:08:23,777 --> 00:08:29,679
In this vote, Imran Khan proved his majority with 178 votes once again.

178
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:33,347
It was clear that the MNAs with whom Imran Khan had formed the government,

179
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,414
all of them still supported his government.

180
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:38,260
But now, one year later.

181
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,778
The tables have turned.

182
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:42,703
This time, instead of Imran Khan, the opposition demanded

183
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:44,557
a vote of confidence.

184
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,749
They presented this demand on 8th March.

185
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:49,534
On 10th March, Islamabad Police,

186
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:51,347
raided the Parliament lodges.

187
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:54,025
Opposition politicians were dragged away

188
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:55,702
and arrested by the police.

189
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,950
The opposition protested against the government because of this incident,

190
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,990
this brutality.

191
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,079
The way the opposition politicians were treated.

192
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:04,648
"Arrests have begun.

193
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:08,161
The ones present in the Parliament Lodges

194
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,878
are being arrested.

195
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:19,059
They have started arresting the JUI-F workers present here."

196
00:09:19,562 --> 00:09:21,581
The Interior Minister of Pakistan claimed that

197
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,077
it was important to do so,

198
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:27,087
because the members of the opposition were bringing in crowds to the Parliament.

199
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:28,576
They were calling in mobs.

200
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:31,940
He claimed that JUI-F brought in 70 workers

201
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,352
while no one is allowed to have a private militia.

202
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,498
In the midst of all this, Pakistan's Army,

203
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:39,838
which has a large influence on Pakistan's politics,

204
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:41,837
I talked about this in an interview

205
00:09:41,837 --> 00:09:43,529
it has been about 3-4 years,

206
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,108
when I interviewed a Pakistani activist. 

207
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:48,031
You can watch the video, I link to it in the description.

208
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,854
Pakistan's Army looked at this situation,

209
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:52,749
and decided to be neutral.

210
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:54,081
They didn't choose any side.

211
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:56,423
This angered Imran Khan.

212
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:58,214
In his speech, he said,

213
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:02,600
This was a big blow to Imran Khan,

214
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,758
because it was believed that

215
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:07,333
he was in power because of Pakistan's Army and ISI's support.

216
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,119
And was keeping the opposition in check.

217
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:10,702
Then on 18th March,

218
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:12,684
came another blow to Imran Khan.

219
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:16,335
His party members started revolting against him.

220
00:10:16,335 --> 00:10:20,532
PTI's rebel MNA, Raja Riaz, told news outlets,

221
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:23,485
that about 24 politicians in PTI,

222
00:10:23,485 --> 00:10:25,771
were ready to leave their party.

223
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:27,517
"How many MNAs are with you?

224
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:31,041
We're about 2 dozen people.

225
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,285
-24?
-Yes, sir.

226
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:34,506
-And they're related to PTI?
-Yes, they're from PTI.

227
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:36,620
-Twenty four?
-Twenty four."

228
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,617
It meant that without their support, Imran Khan's government would fall.

229
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:42,751
He said that most of those politicians

230
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:44,604
were in the Sindh House in Islamabad.

231
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:47,167
Raja said that he was disappointed with their Prime Minister.

232
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,687
There was a gas shortage in his constituency, 

233
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:51,217
he talked to the PM about it,

234
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,598
but nothing was done to address it.

235
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:56,326
After this interview, Imran Khan replied by saying that

236
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:59,165
the Sindh House where the politicians were staying at,

237
00:10:59,165 --> 00:11:01,254
had become a centre for horse-trading.

238
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:02,743
When the news reached more people,

239
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:05,643
Imran Khan's supporters, the PTI party workers,

240
00:11:05,643 --> 00:11:08,031
went to the Sindh House in a group,

241
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:10,163
raised some slogans in favour of Imran Khan,

242
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:13,045
and accused the rebel MNAs to have sold off their conscience. 

243
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:16,283
They climbed over the wall and entered the Sindh House.

244
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:27,311
The next day, on 19th March,

245
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,422
Imran Khan said that the rebel politicians in his party

246
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:33,148
have agreed to stay with the party.

247
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:35,727
On 20th March, Imran Khan gave them an offer;

248
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:38,394
if all of them went back to PTI,

249
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:39,634
they would be forgiven.

250
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:41,173
But on 22nd March,

251
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:44,941
the rebel MNAs rejected the offer of forgiveness.

252
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:47,773
On the contrary, an MNA, Dr Ramesh Kumar said that 

253
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:51,242
the number of rebel politicians had increased.

254
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:55,501
He said that there were 35 politicians who wanted to leave their party.

255
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:59,387
Ramesh Kumar said that crimes against minorities are on a rise in Pakistan.

256
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:02,305
"Earlier, on your program, we said that there are 33 members, today, 

257
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:06,361
35 members, an increase of 2 members,

258
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:10,816
35 members are showing their grievance with the party right now,

259
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:12,881
that these are our grievances,

260
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,469
That these are the things we discussed,

261
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:17,194
but nothing has been done for the minority."

262
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:20,676
Ahmed Hussain said that the Prime Minister had stopped listening to the people.

263
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:22,805
Inflation is on a steep rise in the country.

264
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,138
There are more and more difficulties for the masses.

265
00:12:25,138 --> 00:12:28,099
Pulses, flour, butter, sugar, the prices of all are rising.

266
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:32,702
The rebel MNAs were issued Show Cause Notices by Imran Khan's government.

267
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:35,620
According to the Article 63A of Pakistan's Constitution,

268
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,388
the MNAs of a party aren't allowed to easily defect to another party.

269
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:41,617
There are many restrictions on that.

270
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:43,677
But these MNAs replied that

271
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:45,228
they hadn't left the party.

272
00:12:45,228 --> 00:12:47,004
That they haven't left PTI,

273
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:49,330
and neither did they join another party.

274
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,306
For Imran Khan, the problem was that,

275
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:54,220
even if the MNAs didn't defect to another party,

276
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,959
even if they were disqualified,

277
00:12:57,196 --> 00:13:00,366
Imran Khan would still fall short of the majority mark.

278
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:02,838
More problems ensued on 23rd March.

279
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:06,735
Till then, politicians of Imran Khan's party were creating problems,

280
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:10,258
but starting then, the collation parties started creating problems too.

281
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:12,645
Three collation parties started saying that

282
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:15,817
They would stop supporting Imran Khan's government.

283
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:17,672
The first was the PML-Q,

284
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,399
a breakaway faction of the Pakistan Muslim League.

285
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,326
The second, MQM-P.

286
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:23,948
And the third was the BAP.

287
00:13:23,948 --> 00:13:25,526
Balochistan Awami Party.

288
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:27,622
They had a total of 17 seats.

289
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:31,592
So what could Imran Khan have done to save his government?

290
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,741
He tried to woo the collation parties.

291
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:39,237
On 28th March, the PML-Q leader was offered the post of Punjab's CM.

292
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,978
The Punjab in Pakistan.

293
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:44,829
The post of the Chief Minister of that state was offered to the leader of this collation.

294
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:47,731
By doing so, he retained PML-Q's favour. 

295
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:51,885
MQM-P was offered the Ministry of Ports and Shipping.

296
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:55,411
But on 30th March, this party signed an agreement with the opposition.

297
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,554
Imran Khan replied to this by saying that

298
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:58,988
he plays till the last ball.

299
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:01,588
That he would fight till the last ball to save his government.

300
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:03,904
After this point in time, Imran Khan,

301
00:14:03,904 --> 00:14:07,486
starting building conspiracy theories about foreign involvement.

302
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:09,729
He said that because he had gone to Russia,

303
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:13,821
America was infuriated over his Russian visit,

304
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:16,232
that's why America is trying to topple his government.

305
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:19,832
In fact, he claimed that all the opposition members had teamed up with America.

306
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:23,590
That they have tied up with the USA to overthrow his government.

307
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,415
The US State Department and the opposition

308
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:29,389
refuted this accusation.

309
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:31,780
They claim that Imran Khan is making things up.

310
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,910
This is something that the leaders of many countries resort to.

311
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:38,054
Once they've failed and there are no more excuses,

312
00:14:38,054 --> 00:14:40,823
they start blaming foreign countries.

313
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:43,319
After this, came 3rd April.

314
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:47,107
The day the Vote of Confidence was supposed to be held in the Assembly.

315
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:50,141
On this day, Imran Khan didn't appear before the National Assembly.

316
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:53,255
But his conspiracy theory about foreign involvement 

317
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:55,455
was now taken up by his Law Minister too.

318
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,969
The Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly,

319
00:14:57,969 --> 00:14:59,456
was from his party.

320
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:02,078
He said that because there is foreign involvement,

321
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,161
there cannot be a No-Confidence vote based on that.

322
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:08,711
He invoked Article 5 of Pakistan's Constitution.

323
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:11,609
It states that a No-Confidence vote is illegal

324
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:13,809
if there's an involvement of foreign powers.

325
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:16,255
There was no solid evidence supporting it.

326
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:17,910
2 days later, it was reported that

327
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,781
on that day, the Speaker of the Assembly wasn't present.

328
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:24,205
And it was said by the Deputy Speaker.

329
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:27,941
And the Speaker wasn't present because he wasn't in favour of the Article 5 ruling.

330
00:15:27,941 --> 00:15:32,159
After this ruling, Imran Khan advised the President of Pakistan Arif Alvi,

331
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,642
to dissolve the entire Assembly,

332
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,069
and conduct fresh elections in Pakistan.

333
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,260
And their President did so.

334
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,588
Because the President is like a rubber stamp

335
00:15:41,588 --> 00:15:43,250
he doesn't have many powers.

336
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,635
Till this point in the story, you would feel that

337
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:47,795
it was a happy ending for Imran Khan.

338
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:52,306
That he saved his government by calling for fresh elections.

339
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:53,961
But seeing this happen,

340
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:56,531
the Cheif Justice of Pakistan's Supreme Court,

341
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:58,332
took suo moto cognizance of this matter,

342
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,546
meaning, he brought this matter to the Supreme Court.

343
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:04,065
Supreme Court didn't prolong the proceeding. 

344
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:06,909
Neither was the Supreme Court cowed by the government. 

345
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:13,605
Rather, Pakistan's Supreme Court showed brilliant independence of the Judiciary.

346
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,578
On 7th April, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court,

347
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:18,336
passed a unanimous verdict.

348
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:21,132
They said that the actions of Imran Khan's government 

349
00:16:21,132 --> 00:16:22,756
were unconstitutional.

350
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,888
They could not dismiss the No-Confidence Vote with such tactics.

351
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:29,544
The fresh elections being called for

352
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:31,747
was declared null and void by them.

353
00:16:31,747 --> 00:16:35,693
And the demand of the opposition parties for a Vote of Confidence,

354
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:38,434
was held valid and given permission to be held.

355
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:40,237
Then came 9th April.

356
00:16:40,237 --> 00:16:42,252
The day of the Vote of Confidence.

357
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:45,893
As expected, Imran Khan's government lost this vote.  

358
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:47,979
The majority mark was 172,

359
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:50,903
and the opposition won 174 votes.

360
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:52,433
An interesting fact here,

361
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:55,966
Imran Khan actually became the first Prime Minister in Pakistan,

362
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:58,690
to be ousted by a No-Confidence Vote.

363
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,426
Strictly speaking, if a Prime Minister needs to be removed before the end of the term,

364
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:07,960
constitutionally, this is the only way to do so.

365
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,045
So in a way, this political crisis in Pakistan,

366
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,027
is good news for Pakistan's democracy.

367
00:17:15,027 --> 00:17:18,016
Supreme Court acted independently.

368
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:20,262
There was no interference from the army.

369
00:17:20,262 --> 00:17:23,887
And the Prime Minister was removed constitutionally.

370
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,220
It's said that Shehbaz Sharif can be the next Prime Minister of Pakistan.

371
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:30,348
I talked about him at the beginning of the video.

372
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:35,713
Overall, this situation isn't terribly bad for Imran Khan yet.

373
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,363
It's true that he has been removed from the post,

374
00:17:38,363 --> 00:17:41,877
but Pakistan's General Elections is only a year and a half away.

375
00:17:41,877 --> 00:17:45,136
Imran Khan wanted the Assembly to be dissolved now,

376
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:46,599
and fresh elections to be called.

377
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,160
Because he believes that the people still support him.

378
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,578
And if this is true,

379
00:17:51,578 --> 00:17:54,370
there will be elections in 1-1.5 years,

380
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,157
Imran Khan can wait for 1.5 years.

381
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:00,367
If Pakistan's people really support him,

382
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:02,656
he will win the next elections.

383
00:18:02,656 --> 00:18:06,772
By not accepting the No-Confidence Vote, Imran Khan

384
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:08,797
is ruining his image.

385
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:12,431
Here, I'm reminded of former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

386
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:18,124
He lost the Vote of Confidence in 1999 by 1 vote.

387
00:18:18,124 --> 00:18:20,758
With only 1 vote, his government was overthrown.

388
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:24,540
But he didn't use any conspiracy of foreign involvement,

389
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,534
he gracefully accepted this decision,

390
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:29,152
and he stepped down from the position of the Prime Minister.

391
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:31,757
Months later when the elections were held again,

392
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:33,565
he was back in power

393
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:35,467
with a stable majority.

394
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:39,105
That's why I believe that Imran Khan should accept the result.

395
00:18:39,105 --> 00:18:41,944
And respect Pakistan's Constitution.

396
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:46,922
Why is it that some countries are successful at protecting democracy?

397
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:49,312
While others fail.

398
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:52,465
On this topic, I would like to recommend an insightful book,

399
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:56,194

Why Nations Succeed or Fail.

00:18:56,194 --> 00:18:59,938
