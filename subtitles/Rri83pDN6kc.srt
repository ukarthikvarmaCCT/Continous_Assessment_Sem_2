1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,240
this is a jet powered car and that is Mr

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,359
Beast how's it going and if this car

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,280
can't jump over those school buses my

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,920
video's ruined and to make things even

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,599
more interesting we put this whole thing

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,519
together in about 30 days and we have no

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,279
idea if it works send the jet engine go

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,240
go

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,000
go I'm James welcome to

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,800
Donut we have a LIF off so Mr Beast hit

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,000
us up and asked us to build him a jet

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,480
powered car this dude is the biggest

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,399
YouTuber in the world so obviously we

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,280
said yes and we're all super stoked and

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,640
optimistic about this project there's no

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,280
way there's no way come 30 days to build

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,199
a rocket car why not explain okay so

18
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,000
technically we have a few problems to

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,480
actually pull this off we're going to

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,160
need to find a car that we can attach

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,480
Jets to we're going to need to find Jets

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,359
and then figure out how to put them on

23
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,039
the car and we need a way to control the

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,719
car without someone having to be inside

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,640
of it luckily we're really good at

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,159
buying dumb Vehicles so first things

27
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,040
first we hopped on Greg's list to find

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,640
ourselves a

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,640
car and this is what we ended up with

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,840
it's a 1997 Firebird a car that sort of

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,360
looks fast but it's not something that

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,600
we really feel too bad about destroying

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,960
you ready to hear this baby

34
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:28,040
purr that's what a V6 supposed to sound

35
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,000
like take the thing for a spin there's

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,799
something loose on this front left I

37
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,880
don't know what it is I thought I could

38
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,479
hear a little squeaky noise coming from

39
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:37,000
the left rear listen the thing really

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,159
just has to live for about 2,000 more

41
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,600
miles so now that we have our car all we

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,920
got to do is put Jets on

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,439
it um you just can't go to Jet

44
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,479
engine.com but we're not even figur

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,159
we're not even figuring that part out

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,360
turns out buying Jets isn't as easy as

47
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,040
you'd think you need all kinds of

48
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,680
permits to buy the type of engines that

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,759
we need plus we've never worked with

50
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:01,439
jets before and haven't no idea how to

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,119
even use them but we told Mr Beast we'd

52
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:06,560
build him a jet powered car so we have

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,440
to find a solution and that's when

54
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,959
Jeremiah came up with a brilliant idea

55
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,640
go on YouTube and type in jet engine and

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,599
that's when he found a guy who just

57
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,840
might be crazy enough to help us out

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,120
Matt take it away yeah my name is Matt

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,640
from warp

60
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,280
perception turns out Matt has put jet

61
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,840
engines on a bunch of things not only

62
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,800
does Matt have access to the jet engines

63
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,480
We need he also volunteered to help us

64
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,360
put them on the car all right Matt so Mr

65
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,480
Beast wants us to jump a car over the

66
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,200
length of a football field is this

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,519
something you think we're going to be

68
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,800
able to do ah yeah yeah that's

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,959
doable so we have our Jets but that

70
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,239
brings us to a new problem Matt lives

71
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,200
all the way in Chicago and we're going

72
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,159
to need to bring the car to him now you

73
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,920
might not be surprised to learn that we

74
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,319
didn't exactly buy the best conditioned

75
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,480
Firebird so we're going to need to do

76
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,360
some road trip prep I will see you in

77
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
Chicago very soon Matt see you here

78
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,840
you're welcome in Chicago yeah

79
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,360
baby step one install a sick vinyl wrap

80
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,760
we're also going to need beefier

81
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,400
suspension to withstand the impact of

82
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,280
the ramp at high speed we've got a few

83
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,040
things to do to get this thing ready for

84
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
the big jump uh we're going to be

85
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,080
replacing the stock wheels and tires

86
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,680
with a six set of esrs and we have some

87
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
fresh suspension just to freshen this

88
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,159
thing up a little bit so that we leave

89
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,840
the ramp nice and predictably after a

90
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,080
few days of work it's finally time to

91
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,800
hit the

92
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,909
[Music]

93
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,400
road Justin is making great time and

94
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,280
certainly nothing bad will happen in

95
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,000
Nebraska what happened whole pulley fell

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,280
off there's supposed to be a pulley

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,239
right here and now the belt is just

98
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,120
rubbing against this be

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,920
bearing we only have 15 days left before

100
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,280
jet car needs to be in North Carolina

101
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,920
and not broken so unfortunately we have

102
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,519
to get a trailer and tow the car the

103
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:09,319
rest of the way to Matt

104
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,040
Shop push it into the shop all right

105
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,359
guys I'm here ready to get started

106
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,919
what's up Matt what's up Justin what's

107
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,240
up first order of business now that

108
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,520
we're in Chicago check out that shiny

109
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,160
Bean second order of business fix that

110
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,120
pulley that made the car undrivable so

111
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,880
all I need to do replace the belt and

112
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,600
replace this pulley should be simple

113
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,840
15-minute job never works out that way

114
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,280
and with the F bird fixed it's finally

115
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,680
time to check out the Jets why not take

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,440
Matt's jet powered scooter out for a

117
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,840
spin dude this thing is

118
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,320
terrifying dude this guy's a warrior man

119
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,360
just should not be doing that now when

120
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,840
you think of a jet engine you probably

121
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,560
think of the big old Honkers on a

122
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,560
fighter jet we're going with something

123
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,440
obviously a lot smaller now specifically

124
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,360
this is a single stage turbo jet engine

125
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,199
it actually has a lot of similarities

126
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,840
with a turbo that you'd find in a car

127
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,319
engine now there are a couple components

128
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,440
to focus on now this compressor wheel is

129
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,520
what pulls in air into the combuster now

130
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,680
this would be the equivalent of a

131
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,840
combustion chamber in your car now air

132
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,319
gets pulled through and compressed in

133
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,520
the combuster fuel gets squirted in

134
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,520
through these nozzles right here now you

135
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,479
have compressed air you have fuel you

136
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,440
get spark in there when that spark

137
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,600
happens you get exhaust coming out which

138
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
spins the turbine wheel and this turbine

139
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
wheel is on the same shaft as the

140
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,560
compressor so you get more air being

141
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,000
pulled through so you can see how

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,160
similar that is to how turbo works now

143
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,600
the excess exhaust gas gets shot out

144
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,520
this nozzle right here and you get

145
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,199
forward thrust we'll be attaching seven

146
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,240
of these Jets to our Firebird for a

147
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,160
total of 500 50 lb of thrust now that's

148
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,000
not much compared to a commercial plane

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,160
like a 747 which makes over 100 times

150
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,520
that but when we combine this with the

151
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,120
acceleration from our V6 it should give

152
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,120
us enough beans to clear the football

153
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,280
field also unlike a regular car the Jets

154
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,639
will keep our Firebird accelerating even

155
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,199
after it leaves the ramp pretty cool so

156
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,400
now we just need to slap seven of these

157
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,199
bad boys on the back of our Firebird

158
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,919
should be easy right all right so we are

159
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,520
waiting on some parts to get here supply

160
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,479
chain issues have delayed some of the

161
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,680
crucial parts to mount the jet engines

162
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,160
so instead we got to move on to the RC

163
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,280
system our solution to this problem is

164
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,160
to attach big servos to the steering

165
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,880
wheel and the throttle so that Nolan can

166
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,560
drive it like a regular remote control

167
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,440
car we're pretty much building a full

168
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,880
scale RC

169
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,800
car going to do this sort of uh quick

170
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,319
coupling adapter the steering wheel

171
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,360
Amazon does not have the hub adapter for

172
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
the steering wheel for this car for some

173
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,759
reason so it looks like we're just going

174
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,879
to have to make it and I love making

175
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,879
parts from leftover scraps now that our

176
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,919
hub adapter is made everything's looking

177
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:09,080
good and moving swimly our plan actually

178
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,199
worked so yes good thing happen this

179
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,800
remote control system here actuates the

180
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,479
brake pedal as well as a there's a

181
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,759
steering servo so now there's no you

182
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,240
know human controls so the wiring is

183
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,840
good the system has power oh my God it's

184
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,319
turning what that's so sick

185
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,759
[Music]

186
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,039
sure what that is sick at the P look at

187
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,680
the PD oh it's

188
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,919
moving look I'll be honest I am a little

189
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,840
nervous cuz I want us to be able to jump

190
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,280
this thing but I'm also really excited

191
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,720
to do this like this is amazing this is

192
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,960
super

193
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,400
cool after a few days of working on the

194
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,120
RC system the missing jet Parks finally

195
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
arrived so now that we're this far the

196
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,520
only real thing that's causing us issues

197
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,000
is we don't have a lot of time to test

198
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,479
it we are in a rush so uh hopefully we

199
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:08,240
can get as much development time in this

200
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,800
very short amount of time we have

201
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,519
[Music]

202
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,759
[Music]

203
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,560
left all right it's been a long day we

204
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,360
have the fuel lines hooked up all we got

205
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,000
to do is put some fuel in the tank and

206
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,720
we get to fire it up and here it for the

207
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,320
first time you nervous yeah to test this

208
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,200
we have to start all seven engines at

209
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,240
the same time to check the amp draw we

210
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,440
are in the neighborhood it's 1 p.m. but

211
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,279
got to do what we got to

212
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,080
[Music]

213
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,200
do the Jets are finally running or so we

214
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,079
thought so we got one 1 two three yeah

215
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:01,240
four

216
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,040
started three didn't so we're going to

217
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,399
do something with that battery and try

218
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,800
again right only two of the engines had

219
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,320
actually fired up at Full Throttle

220
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,720
meaning we have a serious wiring issue

221
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,480
to figure out and the jump is like in 3

222
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,760
days so we have no choice but to deal

223
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,800
with those issues when we get

224
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,240

248
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,079
docomo so now while the boys made their

249
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:19,360
way to North Carolina I hopped on a jet

250
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,880
powered vehicle of my own a

251
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,040
[Music]

252
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
jet

253
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,800
we just found out that Nolan and Phil

254
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,000
and Justin are about 2 hours uh late

255
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,440
they're 2 hours later than they said

256
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
they would be

257
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,160
here so it's not a really great look for

258
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,639
donut there they are jet car has landed

259
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,720
with all of us finally together we got

260
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,959
our first look at Mr Beast

261
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,800
jump a full4 mile drag STP leading to a

262
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,399
massive ramp over an entire football

263
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,040
field with 12 school buses on it I love

264
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,639
the optimistically tall Landing ramp as

265
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,480
well Landing ramp is taller than this

266
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,480
ramp and Meanwhile we're sitting here

267
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,760
thinking should we tell him our car

268
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,040
doesn't work

269
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,880
yet we still have to address all the

270
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,880
problems with the car plus we haven't

271
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,240
done any testing to make sure Nolan can

272
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,560
actually drive the thing without

273
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,399
crashing and to make things even worse

274
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,000
we were informed that the algorithm

275
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,959
doesn't like green Flames so we had to

276
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,920
take them off okay we're at the track

277
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,120
the jump is tomorrow but we still don't

278
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,560
know what's up with those five engines

279
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,160
that didn't fully spin up so uh we got

280
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,399
to test that and then we opened up the

281
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,839
trunk and found another problem we got a

282
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,760
giant pool of kerosene sitting in the

283
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,000
bottom of the trunk the kerosene fuel

284
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,480
from the Jets spilled everywhere during

285
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,200
the road trip and all of the electronics

286
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,880
got soaked oh that was sick did it all

287
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,760
come

288
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,040
out cap this dude that's a lot of oh my

289
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,240
God we spilled a bunch of kerosene on

290
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,040
our engine control units so uh Matt and

291
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,720
I have taken them out of the car Matt's

292
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,399
going to clean them uh and then we'll

293
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,839
put them back together hopefully no

294
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,279
kerosene has gotten into weird

295
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,320
electrical connections and messed it up

296
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,560
I'm so tired and this is very stressful

297
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,399
if the electronics don't work neither

298
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:27,880
will our Jets so we have no choice but

299
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,519
to sit here and wait for them to dry

300
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,120
out a few hours later everything seems

301
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,519
dry enough I think they the purple

302
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,800
temperature so Matt and Nolan wired up

303
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,680
the first jet but I'm actually nervous

304
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,240
here because we won't be able to get

305
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,440
another one if one of these uh gets

306
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,399
damaged so no sleep now it's time to see

307
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,520
if it actually

308
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,799
[Music]

309
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,880
works okay so that's one that we know

310
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,079
Works uh so now we just kind of have to

311
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,279
connect the stuff back together how we

312
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,360
already did and hopefully all seven fire

313
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,839
back up we're going to test all seven

314
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,040
engines at the same time make sure they

315
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,600
can all hit Full Throttle at the same

316
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,440
time Perfect all right so we're in the

317
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,639
car now uh we're going to see how much

318
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,399
the Jets can move the car on their own

319
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,560
we're going to put in neutral and see

320
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,800
what happens

321
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,760
uh

322
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
yeah

323
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,560
chcken down dude I'm not I'm not I'm not

324
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,600
Mak that bro let's cut

325
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,880
it no no no that's not what I me that

326
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,199
was no engine that was just all jet all

327
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:58,519
Jet and neutral nice okay so that was

328
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,079
only slightly terrifying uh but we have

329
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,399
run out of daylight and we still haven't

330
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,240
tested the RC system yet so we have a

331
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,320
very little time in the morning and then

332
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,199
we have to do the

333
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,480
[Music]

334
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,800
jump we're back I've got a full night's

335
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,639
sleep and I feel great okay we got 2

336
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,000
hours until Mr Beast gets here 2 hours

337
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,839
sounds like a lot of time but it's

338
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,160
really not when we got here the jet

339
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,240
engines were pouring gas all over the

340
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,920
track luckily we addressed that still

341
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,120
the brakes don't work I've never driven

342
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,800
it with the RC system but I guess the

343
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,839
good news is that Jimmy gets here in 2

344
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,759
hours

345
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:37,000
so we have 20 minutes left we are

346
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,320
finally testing the RC system uh we're

347
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
still having some trouble with the

348
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,680
brakes right down to the wire as we

349
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,120
always are okay here we go

350
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,000
so it works perfect all right we're

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,959
going to go to the uh midpoint location

352
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:00,880
where I'm going to be sitting for the

353
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,160
Run car uh works now we just got to test

354
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,880
it with driving with the fpv system get

355
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,600
some practice in oh yeah not only will

356
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,199
Nolan be controlling an actual car with

357
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,079
a remote controller but he's also going

358
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,079
to be wearing fpv goggles from a drone

359
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:18,399
and we have done absolutely no testing

360
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,759
with any of this stuff either we better

361
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,170
not crash it now cuz we only got one jet

362
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,540
[Music]

363
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
car

364
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,399
my

365
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,639

366
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:40,360
not working oh yeah it is dude that was

367
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,839
a minute of of helmet time before it cut

368
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,240
out like the feed cut out uh a little

369
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,399
stressed right now yeah uh near the end

370
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,399
of the track like the feet on the

371
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,920
goggles cut out so I just lost control

372
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,240
man dude that was a little

373
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,120
nerve-wracking I got to got to be

374
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,480
honest big time big time but before we

375
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,639
can figure out a solution to the goggles

376
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,000
we just got worded that the Beast has

377
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,120
landed Jesus

378
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,800
Christ oh my God oh my God are you going

379
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,560
to start all the way down there

380
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,759
thankfully Mr Beast and his friends are

381
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,959
all impressed I'm bringing my 2-year-old

382
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:22,720
out here this is like I feel like going

383
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,839
to make me the coolest dad ever so I

384
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,120
turn this into the hypothetical wheel

385
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,519
turn oh my God

386
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,639
oh that's so cool where it is very cool

387
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,959
but I don't I don't know I'm just used

388
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,319
to things breaking whenever sometimes I

389
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:37,639
touch stuff like this and then it just

390
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:39,440
stops working and it delays set by it's

391
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,800
not going to stop working okay here just

392
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,759
I here make sure it still works all

393
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,319
right I'll see you in a minute car got

394
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,519
speed car where is it going all you I'm

395
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,519
done and now it's time for the jump but

396
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,959
here's the thing we're not going to jump

397
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,759
jet car just yet we're actually going to

398
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,160
jump not a jet car not a jet car a it's

399
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,959
just a it's just a regular it's a

400
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:04,600
regular now in order to demonstrate how

401
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,600
good jet car is Mr Beast also bought a

402
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,160
second Firebird that we also need to

403
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,039
jump off a ramp and the entire time that

404
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,199
we've been working on jet car Justin has

405
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,839
been working all day mouning the remote

406
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,640
control system to not a jet car but

407
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,720
there are two problems number one the

408
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,000
fpv issue if Nolan falls out of range he

409
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,959
can crash the car so I came up with the

410
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,120
idea to drive down the drag strip in a

411
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,799
side by side to stay close close enough

412
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,080
to the signal problem solved but there's

413
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,280
also a more complicated problem I can

414
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,640
hear the bottle moving there you go not

415
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,720
a jet car might look the same as jet car

416
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,799
but it's a different model gear and our

417
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,000
remote controlled gas pedal won't work

418
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,039
with the newer throttle body and we have

419
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,720
no time to fabricate a new system so

420
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,520
we'll need another way to accelerate the

421
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,160
car we didn't get this car working the

422
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,440
way we wanted but we're going to do it

423
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,520
the caveman way throw a brick on the

424
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,400
pedal and send it to the Moon

425
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,840
bricks all right we're just waiting for

426
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,799
the goahead from the team to send the

427
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,919
stock car down over the ramp I still

428
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,400
have no camera no camera no camera okay

429
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,440
is it good good to go is uh Justin clear

430
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,760

431
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,960

God we got to get over there where's the

439
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,159
golf cart D dude that was the sickest

440
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,360
thing ever Against All Odds not a jet

441
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,600
car was a success Nolan laced it holy

442
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,760
crap boys this is insane it went through

443
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,919
a bus it went right through the

444
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,200
emergency

445
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,360

God I can't wait any longer J in let's

449
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,840
do we still have a jet car to jump and

450
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,200
if it doesn't do better than not a jet

451
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,400
car the whole project will be a failure

452
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,559
and we'll be so embarrassed and with the

453
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,400
sun going down on North Carolina the car

454
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,520
was as ready as it can be it's time to

455
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,799
line it up on the drag strip and get

456
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,200
into position okay I still I do not have

457
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,799
camera feed we still don't have camera

458
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,960

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,159
currently trying to figure it out

462
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,679
because that is the scariest thing that

463
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,919
can

464
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,960
