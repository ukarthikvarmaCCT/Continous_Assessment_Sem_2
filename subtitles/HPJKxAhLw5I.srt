00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,370
- [MrBeast] You guys spammed
me to plant 20 million trees

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,100
on Twitter, Reddit, all
over my comment section.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,300
So I made it happen.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,020
Today, we will be
planting 20 million trees.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,370
And we put 'em in the hole.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,410
Now we need mulch.

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,063
Put the mulch around the tree,

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,493
and we hydrate it.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,440
And there we go.
(bell dings)

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,550
And again.

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,150
Hole, tree, mulch, water.

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,980
And before we go any
further, this is Sarah.

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,780
She's a tree planting expert.

14
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,270
Will this tree grow to be big and healthy?

15
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,250
- I'm gonna look and
see if I can pull on it

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,100
and it doesn't pull out
of the planting hole.

17
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,910
(triumphant jingle)
So good job there.

18
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,910
- Only 19,999,980 more trees.

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,173
Let's go!

20
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:43,364
(all cheer)
Yeah!

21
00:00:43,364 --> 00:00:44,370
- Oh yeah.
- Sturdy?

22
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,570
- Oh, very sturdy.
(bell dings)

23
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,760
- You could tug on this with a rope

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,720
and it wouldn't come out.
(bell dings)

25
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,360
- Chris, I need help. Can
you massage my tree for me?

26
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,920
- Massage your tree?

27
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,690
- I can't get it out of this pot.

28
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,360
- Dude, it's like rock solid in here.

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,710
There you go.
(bell dings)

30
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,800
- So talking to trees
makes them grow faster?

31
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,633
- Huh?

32
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,749
- Grow! What do you want
the planet to die, come on.

33
00:01:04,749 --> 00:01:05,582
- Grow.
- Can you grow!

34
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:06,920
- Do you see the sky? It's so beautiful.

35
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,146
- You're gonna be a house
for birds and stuff.

36
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:10,227
(hands whacking)

37
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:11,877
- You got toughen these trees up.

38
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,370
Look at this. No movement.

39
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,740
So the reason we're spacing
the trees eight feet apart,

40
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,510
is so the roots have to grow out

41
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,590
and they don't have to compete.

42
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,800
- It's kind of weird to put
mulch around a growing tree,

43
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,230
'cause it's grinding up
all of its relatives,

44
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,910
and spreading it around them.

45
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,847
- Bro.

46
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:30,750
(upbeat music)

47
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,460
- All right, well, it's started to rain.

48
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,170
At least now we don't
have to water the trees.

49
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,630
No, but seriously, we wanna
plant 20 million trees

50
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,030
and a little bit of
rain never hurt anyone.

51
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,650
- If a tree falls in the woods,

52
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,510
and no one's around to hear
it, does it make noise?

53
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,010
Yes. It's still a tree.

54
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,240
- [Cameraman] Plant a tree
in the middle of the forest-

55
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,680
- Hold on, I've gotta
do something important.

56
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,524
- Oh okay.
Timber! (explodes)

57
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:49,424
- Why are you mad?

58
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,027
- What is this?

59
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:53,130
(bells dings)

60
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,300
- It's a hole.
- With a tree in it.

61
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,133
- Look at this tree!

62
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:58,680
Look.
(jeans squelching)

63
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,033
You see that?

64
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:01,136
(man screaming)

65
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:03,719
(upbeat music)

66
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,900
- After planting all day,

67
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,970
we only managed to plant 300 trees.

68
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,280
- Which is less than 20
million and my back hurts.

69
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,110
- I put out a tweet and
I have tons of people

70
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,580
coming here tomorrow to plant trees.

71
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,470
- I think I've got an idea for a drone.

72
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,420
- So I haven't mentioned this
yet, but this is Mark Rober.

73
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,290
This is his channel.

74
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,660
He used to work at NASA,
he put this thing on Mars.

75
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,920
He does a lot of cool things.

76
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,090
He's gonna try with the drone,

77
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,410
and we're gonna try with people.

78
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,243
- Play to your strengths.

79
00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:28,200
- May the, the... alright.

80
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,603
It's day number two and we
brought a lot more people.

81
00:02:30,603 --> 00:02:32,480
(crowd cheering)

82
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,980
And now we're gonna try to
plant the 20 million trees.

83
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,887
So step one is we need to
give everyone their tree.

84
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:39,095
- Can I have a fist bump?
- Yes.

85
00:02:39,095 --> 00:02:40,530
- Oh my God.

86
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,090
- Here's your tree.
- I shall name him Russell.

87
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,923
- Russell.

88
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:43,830
- Look at all these people.

89
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,620
We're easily gonna hit 20 million.

90
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,880
(electronic upbeat tune)

91
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,500
And now it's time to begin.

92
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,141
Let's plant the trees.

93
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:52,890
(crowd cheering)
Unless you're him.

94
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,360
He already planted it.

95
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,640
- You're doing great.
- Great, good job.

96
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,630
Do you need help?

97
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,220
- If you would like to help, go for it.

98
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,303
- Dig right here, seems
like the best spot.

99
00:03:01,303 --> 00:03:02,577
- The hole's too big.

100
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:04,890
(dramatic music)

101
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,990
- Tree review.
(rock music)

102
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,343
See the tug test?

103
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,580
You don't want any
oxygen in the root system

104
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,900
or the tree won't survive.

105
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,790
What are these people doing?

106
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,870
That's a solid tree.

107
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,703
- That's a solid boy?
- That's a solid tree.

108
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:18,330
- Okay, good.
- That's great.

109
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,298
Whoever planted that, amazing.

110
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:22,881
(upbeat music)

111
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,610
Make sure you want to do a donut.

112
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,600
Can I believe in you?
(bell dings)

113
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,340
Thank you so much for helping
us do this, by the way.

114
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,240
How'd you hear about this?

115
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,760
- Oh, I saw the tweet. Had to hop in.

116
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,650
- Ooh. Not bad.
- Fits well, I like it.

117
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,760
Thanks for helping with my tree, man.

118
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,593
- Of course.
- Appreciate it.

119
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:40,810
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you as well.

120
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,080
- I was honestly like, I have to do this.

121
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,000
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

122
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,230
- We're gonna get to the 20 mill, right?

123
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,370
- Oh 100%. No doubt.
- Alright, cool.

124
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,203
- Thank you.

125
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:50,340
- Interview conducted.

126
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,230
Look at all these people.

127
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,340
Let's do a tree test.

128
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,540
The way you know if they did a good job

129
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,450
is if you can pull on it,
and that one you can pull on.

130
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,040
- You're killing it.
- Thank you.

131
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,140
- [Cameraman] How many trees
have you planted so far today?

132
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,980
- I have dug 473 holes.

133
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,740
- Really?
- Yes.

134
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,637
- How many did you dig?
- Oh my goodness.

135
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:10,680
- Hey you, digging.
- Bro, how's it going?

136
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,760
- I don't know. How's it going?

137
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,110
- It's good. It's good.
- Yeah?

138
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,640
- It's pretty fun to plant some trees.

139
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,170
- It is pretty fun to plant some trees.

140
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,564
- You know.
- You know.

141
00:04:17,564 --> 00:04:18,510
- Earth does a lot.

142
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,736
- Earth does do a lot.

143
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:24,736
(upbeat music)
(bell dinging)

144
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,427
- Do a little tug test. Oh, she's nice.

145
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:28,489
Oh, she's nice.

146
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:29,322
We just need some-
- There we go.

147
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:31,170
- That's a good tree, man.
- Good job Chris.

148
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,180
- Dude, thanks.
- Got 'em!

149
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,013
- There we go.

150
00:04:34,013 --> 00:04:35,700
- He gets a high five, you know, whatever.

151
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,100
- The last tree.
- Thanks Chandler.

152
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,230
- As you can see, there
are a ton of trees here.

153
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,450
Now, we actually grabbed
a drone shot beforehand.

154
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,940
So here's the drone
shot of the empty field.

155
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,230
Look at it. It's empty.

156
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,740
And here's the drone shot now.
Is that a lot of extra trees?

157
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,210
- Yes, it's quite extra.

158
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,070
We had to. Yeah.

159
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,903
- Cool.

160
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,550
Unfortunately, despite having
a large number of people,

161
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,580
we came nowhere near close
to planting 20 million trees.

162
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,200
But I don't wanna let you guys down.

163
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,430
So I devised a plan

164
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,980
where we can actually
plant 20 million trees,

165
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,210
but I need your help.

166
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,190
We partnered with the largest nonprofit

167
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,580
tree planting organization
in the world, Arbor Day.

168
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,600
But we need your help.

169
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,180
Every dollar donated, they
will plant a tree. Watch.

170
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,520
Here's a dollar and I donated it.

171
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,233
- Another dollar, another tree.

172
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,057
- Here's $10 and I just donated it.

173
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:28,200
(bell dings)

174
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,916
This is $30 and guess what
happens when I donate it?

175
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,150
(bell dings)

176
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,062
Even Chandler can do it.

177
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:37,305
- Another one.

178
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:38,580
Another one.

179
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,625
- Yep.

180
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,890
- And another one.

181
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,660
- Arbor Day and their
partners are the pros.

182
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,310
They've planted hundreds
of millions of trees,

183
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,200
they'll make sure they have
a high rate of survivability

184
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,730
and they genuinely do care.

185
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,870
If you donate a dollar,

186
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,910
something like this ends up in the ground.

187
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,480
And given enough time, this
will turn into this masterpiece.

188
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,980
Now one thing I want to address.

189
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,240
I personally haven't always been

190
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,440
the most environmentally friendly.

191
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,550
We've burnt the box for it

192
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,200
and we've done many other dumb things.

193
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,390
And a lot of you might be of
the mindset of the old me.

194
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,940
That was basically someone
else will figure it out.

195
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,810
But that's not how it works.

196
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,090
We genuinely need all the help we can get.

197
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,740
And honestly, I've done everything I can.

198
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,970
I got a bunch of fans together

199
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,590
and we planted thousands of trees.

200
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,320
Me and mark have invested
months of time behind the scenes

201
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,640
into getting this all together.

202
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,130
And I'm personally planting
a hundred thousand trees,

203
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,750
AKA a hundred thousand dollars donation.

204
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,390
I've literally tried my
best to do everything I can.

205
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,830
And now it's your guys' turn.

206
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,020
You guys have been
spamming my comment section

207
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,550
and spamming my mentions on Twitter

208
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,810
telling me to do something.

209
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,820
And now I wanna see that same energy.

210
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,080
We only have one earth

211
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,120
and it's important we take care of it.

212
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,980
Recently, lots of not so great things

213
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,270
have been happening to forests

214
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,520
and people just keep making
fun of our generation

215
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,550
for retweet activism and not
actually doing something.

216
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,620
Which is why we created teamtrees.org

217
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,570
with the help of the Arbor Day Foundation.

218
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,250
This is your chance to make a difference.

219
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,560
For every dollar you
donate here on YouTube

220
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,530
or at teamtrees.org, a
tree will be planted.

221
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,700
And the Arbor Day Foundation

222
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,990
are really good at what they do.

223
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,823
These trees will have

224
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:00,960
an extremely high rate of survivability.

225
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,890
Please donate now.

226
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,780
Don't push it off till
later, you might forget.

227
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,090
This is our chance to
show the world we care.

228
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,740
Teamtrees.org, donate there

229
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,350
or donate using the donate
button below the video.

230
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,183
Thank you.

231
00:07:11,183 --> 00:07:13,606
(bell dinging)

232
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,550
(bomb exploding)

233
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,383
