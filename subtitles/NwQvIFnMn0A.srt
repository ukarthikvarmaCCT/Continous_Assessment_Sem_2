1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,261
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,261 --> 00:00:03,077
I will tell you a religious story

3
00:00:03,077 --> 00:00:06,564
and you have to guess the names of the main characters in this story.

4
00:00:06,564 --> 00:00:08,503
This is the story of a man

5
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:10,478
who has a name with the last two letters

6
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:11,606
being 'AM'.

7
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:13,478
This man had a wife

8
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:15,154
whose name started with S.

9
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:18,295
The husband and wife were exiled from their city

10
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:20,999
and they travelled far towards the south.

11
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:23,972
A relative of this man traveled with them

12
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:25,902
whose name starts with L.

13
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:28,247
On their journey,

14
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:30,607
a king from a faraway kingdom

15
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:32,833
takes the woman with him.

16
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,081
The last letter of the king's name is N.

17
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:37,955
There are many other things in the story,

18
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,563
but in short, the woman is freed

19
00:00:40,563 --> 00:00:42,996
and escapes from the king's captivity.

20
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:45,398
The man and woman then return.

21
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:47,989
Can you fill in the blanks here?

22
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:50,374
You can pause the video and think for a few seconds.

23
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:51,823
You might think it's an easy question

24
00:00:51,823 --> 00:00:53,257
this is the story of Ramayana

25
00:00:53,257 --> 00:00:55,616
in which the characters are Ram, Sita, Lakshman, and Ravan.

26
00:00:55,616 --> 00:00:57,962
But how would it feel if I say that

27
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:00,794
these fill-in-the-blanks fit in another story.

28
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,356
Where our characters are

29
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:04,801
Abraham, Sarah, Lot, and Pharaoh.

30
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:07,102
This is the story of Prophet Abraham.

31
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:08,860
A common prophet in

32
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,190
Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.

33
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,452
A while ago I made a video on Ramayana

34
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:14,707
which was liked a lot by you.

35
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:15,914
If you haven't seen it,

36
00:01:15,914 --> 00:01:17,679
I'll put the link in the description below.

37
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:18,997
You can go and watch it later.

38
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:21,511
So, continuing with this religion series,

39
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,497
in today's episode, let's talk about

40
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:25,160
Prophet Abraham.

41
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,565
Now, some of you might have wondered

42
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:30,258
what was the point of making videos on religions?

43
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:31,761
That too in today's world.

44
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:33,007
Friends, I believe that

45
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:35,352
looking at today's world,

46
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:38,851
I feel that it is necessary to make videos on religions.

47
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:40,975
Because religion has become something

48
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,561
that is being exploited in terribly

49
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,399
by politicians and media

50
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:47,024
to spread fear among people.

51
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,980
Using religion alone,

52
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,036
hatred is being spread among people.

53
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:54,367
And I think videos do 
a good job of countering it.

54
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:58,850
The more people from different 
religions learn about other religions

55
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,408
the more will we be able to relate to each other.

56
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:04,182
The more love and brotherhood will develop among people.

57
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:06,405
So let's start today's story

58
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:08,225
which is common in three religions.

59
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:16,871
Many people believe that Prophet Abraham

60
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:20,229
was the first figure to preach monotheism.

61
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:22,002
Monotheism means to

62
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:23,826
believe in only one God.

63
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:25,692
Its opposite is polytheism.

64
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:27,492
Polytheism means that you

65
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:29,973
believe that there are many gods.

66
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:32,589
Monotheists say that there is only one God.

67
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:33,785
These three religions,

68
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:35,597
Christianity, Islam, and Judaism,

69
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:38,516
are classified as Abrahamic religions.

70
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:40,239
And the word 'Abrahamic'

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,269
is derived from Prophet Abraham.

72
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:43,527
Many people believe that

73
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:45,570
Prophet Abraham was the first prophet.

74
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:47,322
Especially Jews believe this.

75
00:02:47,322 --> 00:02:48,923
Many Christians also believe this.

76
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:50,744
But on the other hand, some Christians say that

77
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:52,374
it was not Abraham but Enoch

78
00:02:52,374 --> 00:02:53,638
who was the first prophet.

79
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:56,524
Genesis chapter 5 verse 22 says that

80
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:58,977
"Enoch walked with God for 300 years."

81
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:02,289
Genesis is actually the first book of the Bible.

82
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:05,525
Enoch is said to be a descendant of Adam.

83
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:08,449
And Adam is believed to be the first human being

84
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,098
by the believers of these three religions.

85
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:11,753
Muslims believe that Adam

86
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:13,660
was the first Prophet.

87
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,484
So, let's start our story

88
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:18,339
with the story of Adam and Eve.

89
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:20,094
You must have heard the names

90
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:21,916
Adam and Eve somewhere.

91
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,345
Adam is also called Aadm.

92
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:26,308
And it is believed that God

93
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:27,730
created him from the soil.

94
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,405
God gave him breath

95
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:31,132
and he became a living being.

96
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:32,799
Throughout this video,

97
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,478
I will use different words to refer to God,

98
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:36,868
but they will mean the same entity

99
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,899
because we are talking about monotheism.

100
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:41,595
So, irrespective of the word,
we're referring to the one God.

101
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:44,179
In the 1500s, there was a very famous painter

102
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:45,625
Michelangelo.

103
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,304
He made this historic painting

104
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:51,086
which can be found in the Vatican City Museum today.

105
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:52,980
He wants to show in this painting

106
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,620
how God created Adam.

107
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,144
After creating Adam,

108
00:03:57,144 --> 00:03:59,636
he was placed in the Garden of Eden.

109
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:01,437
There were two trees in the garden.

110
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:03,652
The first tree was called the Tree of Life

111
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:05,098
and the other was called

112
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:06,734
the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.

113
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:08,709
God told him to eat whatever he wanted

114
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,142
but not to eat any fruit from the other tree.

115
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:12,704
That was the one condition.

116
00:04:12,704 --> 00:04:14,248
Then God thought that

117
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:15,881
the man would feel very lonely

118
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,170
there should be some helper with him.

119
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,361
So after this,

120
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:22,735
God made animals and birds from the soil.

121
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:24,874
But there was no suitable helper.

122
00:04:24,874 --> 00:04:27,252
Then God sent Adam to sleep

123
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:28,776
and when he was sleeping,

124
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:31,708
He took out a bone from his body

125
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,409
and made a woman out of that bone.

126
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,597
Adam named this woman Eve.

127
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:38,373
Eve is also called Ava

128
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:39,830
which means life.

129
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,417
One day, a snake came

130
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,225
and tried to mislead Eve

131
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:46,086
into eating forbidden fruit.

132
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:49,470
The tree whose fruits were forbidden by God

133
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,753
the snake said that eating 
those fruits would enlighten them.

134
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:54,125
That they will become like God.

135
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,460
Tricked by the snake,

136
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,780
Eve ate that fruit

137
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,487
and fed it to her husband Adam.

138
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:01,591
And when God came to know about this,

139
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:03,253
He was angry.

140
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:05,337
In anger, He curses them.

141
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:07,171
The snake was cursed that

142
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:10,576
it will keep crawling on his stomach all its life

143
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,158
and will eat dust all its life.

144
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:14,996
The woman was cursed that

145
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:17,066
she will have to give birth to children.

146
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,426
And while giving birth to children,

147
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:21,287
she will have to endure intense labor pains.

148
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,117
And Adam was cursed to

149
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:25,530
having to work for his entire life.

150
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,238
He will have to work hard to earn a living.

151
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:29,406
And with this,

152
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:33,058
Adam and Eve were thrown out of the Garden of Eden.

153
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:36,414
And they spend the rest of their lives on Earth.

154
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:38,257
It's a very interesting story.

155
00:05:38,257 --> 00:05:39,992
It has been referred to many times

156
00:05:39,992 --> 00:05:41,253
in pop culture movies.

157
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:43,357
One movie that I saw was called Knowing.

158
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:45,175
It is a science fiction movie from 2009.

159
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:46,217
At the end of this movie,

160
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:48,214
Adam and Eve were shown.

161
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,836
But if we move ahead in our story,

162
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,196
then after thousands of years,

163
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:56,364
the population of humans increases on earth

164
00:05:56,364 --> 00:05:58,529
and God starts looking at humans.

165
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,354
And seeing everything, God thinks that

166
00:06:00,354 --> 00:06:02,851
humans had become very evil.

167
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:04,399
They were becoming worse.

168
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,095
God starts regreting creating humans.

169
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:10,603
Who turned out so evil.

170
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,466
He decides to wipe out the whole earth.

171
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:18,785
All the humans, animals, and birds,

172
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:20,119
He wanted to end all.

173
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,755
But in the meantime,

174
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:28,365
there was a good person

175
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:29,205
Noah.

176
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:31,385
Christians call him Noah

177
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:33,536
and Muslims call him Nuh.

178
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:34,884
So, in the eyes of God,

179
00:06:34,884 --> 00:06:36,447
Noah was a very good person.

180
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:39,513
So, God decided to tell him His plans.

181
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:41,100
He told Noah that

182
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,392
He was going to cause a great flood on earth.

183
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:45,216
A great flood will come.

184
00:06:45,216 --> 00:06:46,851
Everything will be wiped out.

185
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:49,629
He told him to make a big boat.

186
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:51,813
He told him to get on the boat,

187
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:56,571
and to bring his wife, their three sons, and their wives.

188
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:58,147
And apart from this,

189
00:06:58,147 --> 00:07:03,120
to bring a male and a female of each living organism,

190
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,900
on his ark.

191
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,910
And obviously, he was asked to take sufficient food with them,

192
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,794
for everyone to survive.

193
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:11,911
So, God waited for Noah to make this boat (ark),

194
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:13,990
and when it was completely built,

195
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,345
there was a flood on the entire earth.

196
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:20,098
It rained continuously for 40 days and 40 nights.

197
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:22,870
Everything on Earth was submerged under water

198
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,418
for 150 days.

199
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:28,631
But Noah's Ark was afloat on the water

200
00:07:28,631 --> 00:07:31,219
and the people on it were alive.

201
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:34,718
Finally, the boat reached the mountain of Ararat.

202
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:37,077
It was the only dry land.

203
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:40,535
With time, the water starts receding

204
00:07:40,535 --> 00:07:42,605
and all the people on this ark

205
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:46,770
came out and got a new chance to live.

206
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,770
I would like to refer to another science fiction film

207
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,085
which had an indirect reference to Noah's Ark

208
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:52,756
the film 2012.

209
00:07:52,756 --> 00:07:54,149
At the end of this film,

210
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:55,857
everything was submerged under water

211
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:59,033
but some ships were built

212
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:00,615
in which some people were able to survive.

213
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:01,948
If you notice,

214
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,432
many Hollywood films have

215
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:05,527
parts of the story which

216
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,517
are inspired by religious scriptures.

217
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:09,295
Many of them are direct films

218
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:10,867
like the film 'Noah'

219
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,266
which is based on this story.

220
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:14,750
But in our story,

221
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,572
Noah made an offering to God.

222
00:08:16,572 --> 00:08:18,423
He asks God to promise that

223
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:21,853
He will never destroy life like that again.

224
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:23,670
Now, the interesting thing is that

225
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,771
there is a similar story in Hinduism.

226
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:28,385
The story of King Manu.

227
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:31,710
A small fish asks for protection from King Manu.

228
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,779
And when the King saved it,

229
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,500
the fish kept growing.

230
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,710
According to the Puranas,

231
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,803
this fish was actually Matsya,

232
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:40,594
an incarnation of Lord Vishnu.

233
00:08:40,594 --> 00:08:42,390
This fish tells King Manu

234
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,960
that a big flood was about to come,

235
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,217
and everything will be destroyed.

236
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:46,802
And tells him to make a boat to survive.

237
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:49,317
So King Manu built a huge boat

238
00:08:49,317 --> 00:08:52,489
which carried many living creatures,
 plants, and Saptarishis.

239
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:54,820
And when the great flood came,

240
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,047
they could survive because of the boat.

241
00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:59,114
And the Matsya awatar

242
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:02,367
guided them safely to the Himalayas.

243
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,241
Now, another mind-blowing thing is that

244
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:06,830
in the ancient civilization of Mesopotamia,

245
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,709
there is a similar story written in the scriptures found there.

246
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:13,879
The Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh.

247
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:17,266
Here, a great sage Utnapishtim was warned

248
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,825
about a great flood

249
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,756
and he saved his relatives,

250
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:24,556
living creatures, and food in a huge boat.

251
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:26,790
Not only that, in Greek mythology,

252
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,000
due to the anger of God Zeus,

253
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,326
a great flood comes.

254
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:33,277
Deucalion was warned about this flood

255
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:35,683
by his father Prometheus.

256
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:38,370
Deucalion and his wife built a boat

257
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,915
to escape the flood.

258
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:41,519
Moving on with the story,

259
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,687
we come to Abram.

260
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:44,819
There is a famous story of Abram

261
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:47,567
when he broke the idols.

262
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,238
This story is not mentioned in the Hebrew Bible,

263
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:54,185
but it is mentioned in Midrash Genesis Rabbah chapter 38.

264
00:09:54,185 --> 00:09:56,745
Midrash is basically a commentary on the Bible

265
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:58,455
by a Jewish Rabbi.

266
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:00,036
We will find this story

267
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:02,639
in chapter 21, verses 51-70 of the Qur'an

268
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,181
with some differences.

269
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:05,923
The basic story is that

270
00:10:05,923 --> 00:10:08,738
it was the era when people used to worship idols.

271
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,809
Abram's father, Terah,

272
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:12,623
was a man who made the idols.

273
00:10:12,623 --> 00:10:14,045
And worshipped them.

274
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:18,595
One day, Abram's father went on a trip far away

275
00:10:18,595 --> 00:10:22,198
and left Abram in charge of his shop.

276
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:24,978
A man came to the shop to buy an idol.

277
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:26,992
Abram asks him for his age.

278
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:28,605
50 years, said the man.

279
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:31,275
"50 years?", said Abram.

280
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:33,438
Abram said that a 50 years old man

281
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:36,122
would be worshipping an idol which is not even older than 1 year.

282
00:10:36,122 --> 00:10:38,085
Hearing this, the man was embarrassed

283
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:39,972
and left the shop.

284
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,671
On another occasion, when no other person was present,

285
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:45,087
Abram picked up a stick

286
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:47,346
and broke all the idols.

287
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,696
And then he placed that stick in the hands of the biggest idol.

288
00:10:50,696 --> 00:10:53,459
When people return, they were shocked.

289
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,461
Some say that Abram must have done it

290
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:57,565
because he always criticised worshipping idols.

291
00:10:57,565 --> 00:10:59,760
They asked Abram why he did it.

292
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,020
Abram replied that the idols were actually fighting with each other.

293
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,095
And that the biggest idol

294
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:08,861
picked up the stick and broke all the smaller idols.

295
00:11:08,861 --> 00:11:10,779
Abram told the people to ask the biggest idol

296
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,195
why he broke the others.

297
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:14,147
People called out his bluff.

298
00:11:14,147 --> 00:11:16,457
They said that the idols cannot fight with each other.

299
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:17,620
Neither can they speak.

300
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,128
So, Abram's asked,

301
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:21,387
"Why do you worship these idols

302
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:24,316
when these statues cannot speak or do anything?

303
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,067
You will not gain anything from it,

304
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,979
nor will you suffer any loss from it."

305
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:32,013
Abram was ordered to go into a big fire.

306
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:33,863
And if Abram was right,

307
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:37,002
the real God will save him.

308
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:39,627
So Abram went into that fire

309
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:41,432
and God saved him.

310
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:42,944
Because of this story,

311
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:44,639
idols are not worshipped

312
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,371
in Judaism and Islam.

313
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:48,808
And some conservative Muslims,

314
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,954
in fact, some conservative Hindus also say that

315
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:54,583
because Hindus worship idols,

316
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,867
Hindus are 'Kafirs' for Muslims.

317
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,711
How true is this?

318
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:01,152
If you look closely,

319
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:03,244
Hindus don't worship idols.

320
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:06,614
They worship God through the idol.

321
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:09,239
It's like you remember your father

322
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,539
by looking at his photo.

323
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:12,752
You remember your father through the photo

324
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:14,226
and show him your love.

325
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:15,519
But it doesn't mean that

326
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,206
you forget your actual father

327
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:19,957
and start showing love only to this physical photo

328
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:21,227
and start remembering the photo.

329
00:12:21,227 --> 00:12:23,275
Similarly, every Hindu knows that

330
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:26,558
God is being worshipped through the idols.

331
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:29,420
The physical idol is not being actually worshipped.

332
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,120
Acharya Prashanth gave a good answer to this

333
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,730
when I spoke to him.

334
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,435
"The idol has been a successful experiment.

335
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:42,529
The idol has been a good means to reach the formless.

336
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,528
And when the idol is worshipped,

337
00:12:44,528 --> 00:12:47,408
it is never said that the idol is the true God.

338
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:49,676
It is said that I will use this idol

339
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:51,872
to reach the true God.

340
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,222
I will use the idol to

341
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:54,380
reach the formless."

342
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,500
Even Christians do not consider this to be wrong.

343
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,956
This is the reason why

344
00:12:57,956 --> 00:13:01,083
you will find Jesus and Mary's idols in many churches.

345
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,304
Many passages are cited by them

346
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,247
to prove this.

347
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:09,690
Chapter 20, verse 4 and 5 in Exodus of the Hebrew Bible,

348
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,957
it is written that God has forbidden 
to make idols of any other thing.

349
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:15,845
He has forbidden bowing down before idols.

350
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,541
It should be noted that

351
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,564
it is not God's idols

352
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,254
it is forbidden to bow down before idols of other things.

353
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:22,942
Now, let's move 5 chapters ahead.

354
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:26,059
Chapter 25, verse 17 to 22 says,

355
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:28,947
God himself commands Prophet Moses

356
00:13:28,947 --> 00:13:31,420
to make a mercy seat of pure gold.

357
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,874
To make idols of Cherub on both sides.

358
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:36,213
God says that he will speak to Moses

359
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:37,938
from among these statues.

360
00:13:37,938 --> 00:13:39,371
This is not the only example.

361
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:41,623
Another book, Hebrew Bible Ezekiel,

362
00:13:41,623 --> 00:13:43,428
chapter 41, verse 25.

363
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:45,871
Read the description of the Temple of Jerusalem.

364
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:49,829
There were carvings of cherub 
and palm trees on the doors and walls.

365
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,784
So it doesn't seem like God

366
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:54,442
has a problem with us using his photos

367
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:56,045
or making his idols.

368
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,887
As long as we use those things

369
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:00,155
to worship God.

370
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:02,783
Not to worship those idols or photos.

371
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:04,370
Quran Surah 4 Ayat 48

372
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,108
is often quoted

373
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:08,159
as the quote to show that

374
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,240
Quran is against making idols.

375
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,770
Here too we see that

376
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,454
"Do not associate partners with God.

377
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:17,315
That is, don't worship anyone other than God.

378
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,721
This sentiment is seen in Chapter 31 Ayat 13 of the Qur'an

379
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:22,605
Worship only God.

380
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:24,772
So to say that all Muslims

381
00:14:24,772 --> 00:14:26,473
consider all non-Muslims to be Kafirs

382
00:14:26,473 --> 00:14:27,919
is a wrong notion.

383
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,856
The people who want to spread hatred

384
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:31,806
are the ones who spread such misinformation.

385
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:34,021
The meaning of the word 'Islam'

386
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:35,604
is Submission before God.

387
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:37,119
Submitting before God.

388
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:39,049
And the meaning of the word 'Muslim'

389
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,955
is the one who submits before God.

390
00:14:40,955 --> 00:14:43,271
That is why from the perspective of a liberal Muslim

391
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:45,675
any person who believes in any religion

392
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:47,009
is a Muslim.

393
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:48,276
Because in his religion,

394
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:49,821
whatever name he has given to God

395
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:51,226
he is worshipping the God

396
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:52,835
and submitting to him.

397
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:54,625
This is not my personal opinion,

398
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,967
this is how it is.

399
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:57,376
Even at that time,

400
00:14:57,376 --> 00:14:59,012
there were many other religions in Arabia.

401
00:14:59,012 --> 00:15:01,374
If you see chapter 2, verse 62 of the Qur'an

402
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:03,285
it says that Jews, Christians, and Sabians

403
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,880
were counted among the believers.

404
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,204
These were the people who believed in God.

405
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:09,949
It mentions fighting

406
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:12,031
only those people

407
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:14,645
who believe an idol to be God.

408
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:16,393
Around 600 AD,

409
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,961
there was a tribe called the Quraysh tribe.

410
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,481
They lived in the region of Saudi Arabia.

411
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:24,069
They believed that their central god

412
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:25,192
was Hubal.

413
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:26,867
Which was actually an idol

414
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:28,249
made of stone

415
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:29,969
and whose right hand was broken.

416
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:32,595
Quraysh tribe replaced its right hand

417
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:34,069
with a golden hand.

418
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,077
With a hand made of gold.

419
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:38,377
Now this idol was actually broken

420
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:41,983
by Prophet Muhammad in 630 AD.

421
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:46,189
Don't confuse mythological stories and actual history.

422
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:48,738
What I just told you is actual, proven history.

423
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:50,410
And the stories before that

424
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,931
were mythological and biblical stories.

425
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,994
If we talk about ancient Egyptians,

426
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:57,759
they worshipped the jackal gods.

427
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,997
Like Anubis and Wepwawet.

428
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:01,811
And apart from stone idols,

429
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:05,070
another type of idol worship has been mentioned in the Quran.

430
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,183
To idolize something.

431
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:09,841
Like in chapter 18, verse 32 to verse 46,

432
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:11,743
a warning has been given.

433
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:15,139
"Don't idolize your property or wealth.

434
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:17,220
Don't worship your wealth."

435
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,247
In chapter 25, it has also been said that

436
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:21,381
people often turn their desire, their ego

437
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:22,652
into God.

438
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:25,869
And you will find the same warning in Hinduism.

439
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:30,127
In Hinduism, even though we get to see different forms of God,

440
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:32,590
we get to see different avatars of God,

441
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,758
but in Bhagavad Gita chapter 10, it is mentioned that

442
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:37,493
Lord Krishna is saying,

443
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:06,348
By the way, if you want to understand Bhagwat Gita better

444
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:09,132
I would suggest this audiobook on KUKU FM

445
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:12,560
Shreemad Bhagwat Gita: Samasyao Ka Samadhan in Hindi

446
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,000
It is a long audiobook.

447
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,074
With more than 25 hours of content.

448
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:20,266
But it's been broken down into small chapters of 8-10 minutes.

449
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:22,508
So you don't have to feel overwhelmed.

450
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,099
You can understand it step by step.

451
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,233
Apart from this, on KUKU FM

452
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:30,088
you can also get an audiobook for Jesus Christ's stories

453
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:32,194
Jesus Christ: The Son of God in Hindi.

454
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:36,314
In case you don't know, KUKU FM 
is a platform for audio-learning platform

455
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:39,340
on which you can listen to a lot of knowledgeable audiobooks.

456
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,450
Not just on religion, but also on science,

457
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,527
history, geography, politics, and audiobooks of such other subjects.

458
00:17:44,527 --> 00:17:45,992

462
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:56,373
The link to this is in the description below.

00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:57,555
Do check it out.

464
00:17:57,555 --> 00:17:59,188
And not just in Gita,

465
00:17:59,188 --> 00:18:01,819
but we get to see mention of monotheism

466
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:04,982
in Rigveda, Mandal 1, Shlok 46.

467
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:08,008
"The Rishi is called by many names

468
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,621
Agni, Yam, Indra, Varun"

469
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,905
Look at Chapter 32 of Yajurveda.

470
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:13,554
It is written that "He is Agni,

471
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:15,190
Aditya, which is Sun,

472
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,084
He is Vayu, Chandrama, Jal,

473
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:18,784
There is no one like him.

474
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:19,802
His name is great,

475
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:21,899
He is in all beings.

476
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:23,663
Before him there was nothing.

477
00:18:23,663 --> 00:18:26,324
All people have been created by that God."

478
00:18:26,324 --> 00:18:28,653
Similarly, if we talk about the other meaning,

479
00:18:28,653 --> 00:18:30,426
then in the texts of different religions

480
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:32,357
whether it is Hinduism, Buddhism or Christianity,

481
00:18:32,357 --> 00:18:34,927
it is mentioned in the scriptures

482
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:37,807
to never idolize your ego.

483
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:41,702
To never worship your material desires or wealth.

484
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:44,326
So you can see how these things mentioned in different religions

485
00:18:44,326 --> 00:18:46,558
align with each other.

486
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,388
How similar these religions are
to each other fundamentally.

487
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:51,453
But one thing is worth mentioning.

488
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:54,243
Even though in Islam, Christianity or Judaism

489
00:18:54,243 --> 00:18:56,868
the people of other religions are not kafirs

490
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:59,694
but atheists are definitely kafirs.

491
00:18:59,694 --> 00:19:02,040
People who don't believe in any god

492
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,730
are definitely called kafirs.

493
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,926
Why am I saying this?

494
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:07,469
Because the word kafir means the same thing.

495
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:09,692
Kufr means disbelief

496
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:12,520
and kafir means one who disbelieves in God.

497
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,053
A person who doesn't believe in God.

498
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,724
But does this mean that

499
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:19,488
we should kill all the non-believers?

500
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:22,127
There are only two ways people can say such things to you.

501
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,393
First, psychopaths.

502
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:26,136
The terrorists who actually want to kill people.

503
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:29,366
And second, people who spread WhatsApp propaganda

504
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:31,113
who want to instil fear in people.

505
00:19:31,113 --> 00:19:33,571
What is actually written in religious scriptures?

506
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:35,612
Quran chapter 9 verse 5 says,

507
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:36,960
Kill the Mushrik,

508
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,022
meaning disbelievers,

509
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:39,187
wherever you find them.

510
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:41,525
You will find such lines in many religious scriptures.

511
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:44,131
Hebrew Bible, Book 1: Samuel, Chapter 15

512
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:47,040
conveys the message of God to Saul.

513
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,334
"Now go attack the Amalekites,

514
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:51,868
and totally destroy everything that belongs to them.

515
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:53,105
Do not spare them."

516
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:57,263
In Christianity, Gospel of Mattew Chapter 10 Verses 34-36.

517
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,475
Jesus tells his disciples

518
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:02,172
"Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth.

519
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:03,812
I did not come to bring peace

520
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:04,734
but a sword."

521
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:07,560
Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2 Shloka 31 to 38.

522
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,847
Lord Krishna tells Arjun,

523
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:11,155
"Happy are the Kshatriyas,

524
00:20:11,155 --> 00:20:14,828
the warriors to whom such fighting opportunities come unsought,

525
00:20:14,828 --> 00:20:18,407
opening for them the doors of the heavenly planets."

526
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:21,893
Such calls for violence can be found in almost every religious scripture.

527
00:20:21,893 --> 00:20:24,110
If I start explaining all of it,

528
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,719
it will be a long video.

529
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:28,864
But in short, all these lines of scriptures

530
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:31,453
are very heavily contextual.

531
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:34,045
If you read it out of context, you will feel that

532
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:37,503
it is true that they are promoting violence.

533
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,350
But if you read it in context, you will understand

534
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,120
the context it is being discussed in.

535
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,781
For example, when Lord Krishna tells Arjun,

536
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:47,921
he says that when the Mahabharata war was going on,

537
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:50,316
when Prophet Muhammad tells his followers,

538
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,031
it is being said

539
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:54,943
in the context of the fight with Quraysh tribe.

540
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:57,015
The same thing is applicable in the case of Samuel.

541
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:59,416
And the line of Jesus here

542
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,338
has a metaphorical meaning.

543
00:21:01,338 --> 00:21:03,820
Actually, in any scripture, it is not said that

544
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,281
one should go and start killing innocent people.

545
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:08,301
It is another thing that

546
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:10,003
the terrorists and orthodox people in every religion,

547
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:13,928
deliberately misinterpret these religion scriptures.

548
00:21:13,928 --> 00:21:16,256
And present them in such a way that

549
00:21:16,256 --> 00:21:18,643
people are influenced to do violence.

550
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:20,545
People start to hate.

551
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:23,184
In our country, we see such great Islamic scholars

552
00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:25,018
like Wahiduddin Khan

553
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:27,392
who was awarded the Padma Vibhushan award

554
00:21:27,392 --> 00:21:29,878
by the Indian government in 2021.

555
00:21:29,878 --> 00:21:33,298
He says that Islam is the religion of peace and tolerance.

556
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:35,703
He conveys this message to people.

557
00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:37,352
And on the other hand, there are people like

558
00:21:37,352 --> 00:21:39,403
terrorist Osama Bin Laden

559
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:41,821
who brainwash people by saying that

560
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:43,786
Islam tells you to kill.

561
00:21:43,786 --> 00:21:46,737
Similarly, if you learn Hinduism from the right scholars,

562
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:48,948
you will learn love and affection.

563
00:21:48,948 --> 00:21:51,134
But if you listen to the evil people,

564
00:21:51,134 --> 00:21:54,215
they will misrepresent these verses of the Gita in a way that

565
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,903
will force you to take up arms.

566
00:21:55,903 --> 00:21:58,595
"Nowhere is it written that religion demands violence.

567
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:01,512
And you should be alerted of this

568
00:22:01,512 --> 00:22:06,209
that there is a centralized conspiracy unit

569
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:09,112
that is plotting such conspiracies

570
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:11,264
of using something that is not even written in the scriptures

571
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:13,055
by writing it in Sanskrit

572
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:16,363
and spreading it through WhatsApp and other sources."

573
00:22:16,363 --> 00:22:19,273
Now let's talk about the 4th story of Abram

574
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:21,227
which I talked about at the beginning of the video.

575
00:22:21,227 --> 00:22:23,005
The same story which was

576
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:25,345
quite similar to the Ramayana.

577
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,889
But if you go into the details,

578
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,291
it is not that similar.

579
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,212
It is just a coincidence

580
00:22:30,212 --> 00:22:31,199
that there were so many similarities.

581
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:33,264
In this story, God told Abram

582
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:34,727
to leave his home

583
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:36,828
and go in search of a place

584
00:22:36,828 --> 00:22:38,249
that God is going to show him.

585
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:40,433
Abram, his wife Sarai,

586
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:42,738
and his nephew Lot,

587
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,066
leave their home.

588
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:46,088
It was by chance that Abram,

589
00:22:46,088 --> 00:22:47,450
was very similar to Ram,

590
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,625
Sarai to Sita 
and Lot to Lakshman.

591
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,844
They go to many places

592
00:22:50,844 --> 00:22:53,384
and finally, take turn towards Egypt

593
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:55,386
to escape a famine.

594
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:57,637
When they were about to enter Egypt,

595
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,988
Abram tells his wife,

596
00:22:59,988 --> 00:23:02,241
"I know how beautiful you are.

597
00:23:02,241 --> 00:23:03,973
When the Egyptians see you,

598
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:06,560
they will see that you are my wife

599
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,735
and they might kill me.

600
00:23:07,735 --> 00:23:09,164
While keeping you alive.

601
00:23:09,164 --> 00:23:11,244
But if we say that you are not my wife,

602
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:12,302
but my sister,

603
00:23:12,302 --> 00:23:14,939
then they will treat me well

604
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:16,687
and my life will be saved."

605
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,529
The kings of Egypt at that time were known as Pharaohs.

606
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:21,491
The Pharaoh's officials saw Sarai,

607
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:25,339
praise her and take her to their palace.

608
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,489
Because Abram said that he was her brother,

609
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,613
Abram gets good treatment

610
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:31,994
and Abram was given many sheep,

611
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:36,180
cattle, donkeys, servants, and camels.

612
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,070
But suddenly, Pharaoh's house

613
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,584
was hit by a lot of serious diseases.

614
00:23:41,584 --> 00:23:43,660
So, Pharaoh suddenly calls Abram

615
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,250
and asks, "What have you done to me?

616
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,772
Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife?

617
00:23:47,772 --> 00:23:49,841
Why did you say that she was your sister?

618
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:51,587
I had made her my wife.

619
00:23:51,587 --> 00:23:54,028
But now, take your wife and go back."

620
00:23:54,028 --> 00:23:55,139
So, on Pharaoh's orders,

621
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:57,228
Abram and his wife and whatever they had,

622
00:23:57,228 --> 00:24:00,175
were sent out of Egypt.

623
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:02,830
After this, Abram went to Negev and Bethel.

624
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,264
and the shepherds of Abram and Lot

625
00:24:05,264 --> 00:24:07,585
start fighting with each other.

626
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:09,567
So, Abram and Lot

627
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:11,696
went their separate ways.

628
00:24:11,696 --> 00:24:15,632
At this point, Abram lived on the land of Canaan.

629
00:24:15,632 --> 00:24:17,548
Abram and Sarai did not have a child.

630
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:21,522
Sarai gave Abram her slave woman Hagar

631
00:24:21,522 --> 00:24:23,366
and a child was born,

632
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:25,588
and he was named Ishmael.

633
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:28,066
God makes an agreement with Abram

634
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,206
that he would be the father of many nations.

635
00:24:31,206 --> 00:24:34,464
Because of this God renamed Abram

636
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:36,997
and names him Abraham.

637
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:39,280
This is the reason why I was

638
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,989
calling Abraham as Abram.

639
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:42,956
Because it was only after this story

640
00:24:42,956 --> 00:24:44,685
that Abram was named Abraham

641
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:47,272
and Sarai was named Sarah.

642
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:49,431
God promised Abraham

643
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:51,271
all the land of Canaan.

644
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:53,697
And what is the description of Canaan exactly?

645
00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:55,398
These are the places that range from

646
00:24:55,398 --> 00:24:56,780
the valley of Egypt

647
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,207
to the Euphrates River.

648
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,848
That is the present-day Israel,

649
00:25:00,848 --> 00:25:02,979
West Bank, Gaza, Jordan,

650
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:05,403
and Syria and Lebanon's southern areas.

651
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:06,904
They were all part of this land.

652
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:08,895
All of this is considered to be a part of this land.

653
00:25:08,895 --> 00:25:10,894
What is the connection with actual history?

654
00:25:10,894 --> 00:25:13,544
When the Zionist movement started in Israel,

655
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:15,722
the Zionists said that

656
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,831
the land promised by God

657
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:19,816
was for the Jews.

658
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:23,331
So when Jews were prosecuted in Europe for centuries,

659
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:26,836
they moved here in 1900 after that.

660
00:25:26,836 --> 00:25:28,210
Moving forward in the story,

661
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,089
God promised Sarah

662
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:31,511
that He will give her a son.

663
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:33,721
And then Isaac is born.

664
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:35,532
By this time, the child Ishmael

665
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:36,947
did not have a good attitude.

666
00:25:36,947 --> 00:25:38,616
So Sarah told Abraham

667
00:25:38,616 --> 00:25:40,993
to send him away.

668
00:25:40,993 --> 00:25:42,549
Abraham hesitates whether or not

669
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:45,065
to send his son away.

670
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:46,637
But when he asks God,

671
00:25:46,637 --> 00:25:48,442
God told him to send Ishmael away.

672
00:25:48,442 --> 00:25:49,950
The slave woman Hagar

673
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,929
went with her son Ishmael to the desert.

674
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:56,044
God arranged water for them

675
00:25:56,044 --> 00:25:57,856
and promised Hagar that

676
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:02,126
one day her son will make a great nation.

677
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:04,391
Jews and Christians believe that

678
00:26:04,391 --> 00:26:06,729
they are the descendants of Isaac.

679
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:08,288
And Muslims believe that

680
00:26:08,288 --> 00:26:10,293
they are the descendants of Ishmael.

681
00:26:10,293 --> 00:26:12,440
This is the point of the story

682
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,626
from which these Abrahamic religions

683
00:26:14,626 --> 00:26:16,159
separate from each other.

684
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,478
Jews believe that Isaac had a son named Jacob.

685
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:23,874
Who was later renamed Israel.

686
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:26,189
And that Israel was actually the ancestor

687
00:26:26,189 --> 00:26:27,876
of 12 tribes of Israel.

688
00:26:27,876 --> 00:26:30,234
That's why today all the Jews believe that

689
00:26:30,234 --> 00:26:31,975
they are actually the descendants

690
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:33,436
of Isaac's son Jacob.

691
00:26:33,436 --> 00:26:35,142
On the other hand, in Christianity,

692
00:26:35,142 --> 00:26:37,332
Jesus is the most important prophet.

693
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:38,895
Christians believe that Jesus

694
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:41,070
is actually the descendant of Isaac.

695
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,758
And because they believe in Jesus,

696
00:26:42,758 --> 00:26:45,781
they consider themselves a spiritual descendant of Isaac.

697
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:47,544
Third, Muslims believe that

698
00:26:47,544 --> 00:26:50,032
Abraham and Ishmael together

699
00:26:50,032 --> 00:26:51,538
built the Kaaba in Mecca.

700
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:54,246
which is the most sacred site of Islam.

701
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,412
That's why Muslims trace back

702
00:26:56,412 --> 00:26:58,748
their spiritual lineage to Ishmael.

703
00:26:58,748 --> 00:27:00,713
So these were some interesting stories

704
00:27:00,713 --> 00:27:02,579
about these three Abrahamic religions.

705
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,394
You can comment below whether you liked them or not.

706
00:27:05,394 --> 00:27:06,955
If you liked them,

707
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:09,837
what other religious videos would you like to see?

708
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,154
There are many stories to tell.

709
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:13,644
The story of Prophet Joseph,

710
00:27:13,644 --> 00:27:14,851
the story of Moses,

711
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:16,187
the Ten Commandments,

712
00:27:16,187 --> 00:27:18,728
and the conquest of Canaan by Joshua.

713
00:27:18,728 --> 00:27:20,196
And then fast-forwarding to the

714
00:27:20,196 --> 00:27:22,435
storied of Prophet Jesus and Prophet Muhammad.

715
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:24,101
And apart from this, there are other religions

716
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:26,181
like Buddhism, Jainism, and Zoroastrianism.

717
00:27:26,181 --> 00:27:28,053
On which religion would you want the next video to be?

718
00:27:28,053 --> 00:27:29,544
Tell me in the comments.

719
00:27:29,544 --> 00:27:33,304
You can enjoy this video of Ramayan by clicking here.

720
00:27:33,304 --> 00:27:34,800
Thank you very much!
