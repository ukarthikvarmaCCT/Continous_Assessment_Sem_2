1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,994
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,994 --> 00:00:04,223
It's been two weeks since
the Israel-Palestine war started.

3
00:00:04,223 --> 00:00:07,294
And now, the situation in Gaza
is no less than h3ll.

4
00:00:07,294 --> 00:00:08,632
Since 9th October,

5
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:11,788
Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza.

6
00:00:11,788 --> 00:00:14,027
This means food, supply of medicines,

7
00:00:14,027 --> 00:00:16,164
water, and even electricity

8
00:00:16,164 --> 00:00:18,174
has been cut off by Israel in Gaza.

9
00:00:18,174 --> 00:00:20,919
On top of that, the
continuous bombardment is unimaginable.

10
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:24,356
The scenes coming out of Gaza are shocking.

11
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:25,573
Look at this footage.

12
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:28,112
Entire neighbourhoods have been reduced to rubble.

13
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:32,076
These were the Gazan
buildings that were targeted by Israel.

14
00:00:32,076 --> 00:00:33,773
Estimates show that

15
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:37,203
more than 2,800 Palestinian civilians have been k*ll*d.

16
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,483
Thousands are still trapped in this debris.

17
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:45,199
The ones who are still alive are trying
to get shelter in hospitals and schools.

18
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:47,468
But by 16th October,

19
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:51,683
water was also running out
in the  United Nations shelters too.

20
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:55,916
The United Nations agency
UNRWA said on 15th October that

21
00:00:55,916 --> 00:01:00,850
they are witnessing an
unprecedented human catastrophe in Gaza.

22
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,748
Mehmood Matar, a surgeon working in Gaza,

23
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:07,565
told BBC that hospitals are completely overwhelmed.

24
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:09,184
There is no water, no electricity,

25
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:11,130
and the network connection is also unstable.

26
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,647
He said that he was looking for water.

27
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:16,132
Another doctor working at
Naseer Hospital in Gaza said that

28
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:17,909
fuel is also going to run out.

29
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,859
There are 60 patients on dialysis.

30
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:21,431
35 patients are in ICU

31
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:23,259
they need ventilators.

32
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:26,103
If fuel runs out, it will not be possible to save them.

33
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:28,706
And this isn't in only one hospital.

34
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:30,319
It's the same everywhere.

35
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,139
On 17th October, health officials said that

36
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:34,942
the only oncology hospital in Gaza

37
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:37,038
would be shut down within 48 hours

38
00:01:37,038 --> 00:01:39,332
if the situation continues like this.

39
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,776
And all cancer patients

40
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:43,470
will be left without critical care.

41
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,879
Take a look at the map of Gaza, friends.

42
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,404
It is a small place.

43
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:50,683
This strip is spread over just 365 kmÂ².

44
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:53,294
If you compare it with the size of New York,

45
00:01:53,294 --> 00:01:55,182
you will realize how small it is.

46
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,116
Even if you compare it with Delhi,

47
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,590
it is almost 1/4th of the size of Delhi.

48
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,691
In this small area, 2.3 million people live.

49
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:04,657
This is one of the most
densely populated places in the world.

50
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,262
Even before the war began,

51
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:08,316
the living conditions here were very bad.

52
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:09,780
The people who lived here

53
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,645
were constantly under Israeli surveillance

54
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:15,687
and could not even travel beyond
Gaza without Israel's permission.

55
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:17,892
It is also important to mention that

56
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:19,694
out of the 2.3 million population,

57
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:21,947
almost half of the population are children.

58
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:22,810
You heard it right.

59
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,700
This is the reason why according to the estimates,

60
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,083
out of all the people k*ll*d in this war,

61
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,546
60% of them were the women and children living in Gaza.

62
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:34,023
But the situation was so
bad even before the war began that

63
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:38,660
those criticising Israel
called Gaza an open-air prison.

64
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,670
As if the place is an open jail.

65
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,050
On 7th October, Ham*s attacked Israel,

66
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,962
which started this war.

67
00:02:45,962 --> 00:02:47,436
But in response,

68
00:02:47,436 --> 00:02:51,178
Israel is continuously attacking Gaza.

69
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:53,776
By putting a total blockade on Gaza,

70
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:55,922
due to which, not only Ham*s members are being k*ll*d,

71
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:59,727
but also Palestinian civilians.

72
00:02:59,727 --> 00:03:01,595
And now Gaza has turned into h*ll.

73
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,087
People say that

74
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:06,394
dolling out collective
punishment like this to the people of Gaza

75
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,515
Israel's action is no less than t*rr*rism.

76
00:03:09,794 --> 00:03:11,657
The Norwegian Foreign Minister said that

77
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:14,638
it is unacceptable to impose a total blockade.

78
00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:18,614
At least humanitarian aid, such as
medicine and food, should be allowed in Gaza.

79
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:23,518
United Nation's Secretary-General
Antonio Guterres had a similar opinion.

80
00:03:23,518 --> 00:03:26,579
Israel should allow humanitarian aid in Gaza

81
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:31,580
and Ham*s should release Israeli
hostages without any conditions.

82
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,654
Imagine in such circumstances,

83
00:03:33,654 --> 00:03:36,619
if you were a common person living in Gaza,

84
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:38,171
what would you have gone through?

85
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:40,165
You don't have electricity, water,

86
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:41,937
internet connection is cut-off,

87
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:43,665
you can't get food from anywhere.

88
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,469
And then one day

89
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:47,905
you suddenly see some pamphlets falling from the sky.

90
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:51,241
On those pamphlets, there is a warning from Israel.

91
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:52,623
In the warning, it is written that

92
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:55,729
all the people living in the north of the Gaza Strip

93
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:57,924
should evacuate and

94
00:03:57,924 --> 00:03:59,353
go to the south of the Gaza Strip.

95
00:03:59,353 --> 00:04:02,199
You can hear the sound of bombardment all around.

96
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,977
And now you are being warned

97
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,285
to vacate your house as soon as possible

98
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:09,257
and go to the south if you want to survive.

99
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:10,373
According to the estimates,

100
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:13,570
about 1.1 million people live in Northern Gaza.

101
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,386
The IDF warned everyone

102
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:17,612
to evacuate and go to the South.

103
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:21,052
The shelters of the United Nations in Northern Gaza

104
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,678
were no longer safe.

105
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:25,000
Anyone could be targeted in Northern Gaza,

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,163
the hospitals, schools or even clinics.

107
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:28,756
The UNRWA pointed out

108
00:04:28,756 --> 00:04:32,182
that many pregnant women, children, and elderly people

109
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:33,831
would not be able to move.

110
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:34,942
Where will they go?

111
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,364
How will they evacuate?

112
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:38,364
On top of that, the World Health Organization

113
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:40,803
strongly condemned Israel's orders.

114
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:42,877
There are 22 hospitals in northern Gaza

115
00:04:42,877 --> 00:04:44,604
which have more than 2,000 patients.

116
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:47,072
How will hospitals be evacuated?

117
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:49,120
Despite this, the Israeli military said that

118
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,925
around 600,000 Gazans

119
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:53,862
evacuated from the northern area to the south.

120
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:56,318
500,000 people did not evacuate,

121
00:04:56,318 --> 00:05:00,562
but let's assume that you were
among those who evacuated to the south.

122
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:03,164
But does this mean you will be safe from the bombings?

123
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:05,476
"Our people that were k*ll*d or injured

124
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:07,228
during these aerial strikes,

125
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:09,120
in their homes in Deir al Balah,

126
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,495
which is located in Southern Gaza."

127
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,950
We witnessed instances

128
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,190
of airstrikes in Central Gaza,

129
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,430
where the homes of many families were destroyed.

130
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,250
People living in Southern Gaza aren't safe either.

131
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,440
Khan Yunis, a city in Southern Gaza,
had to suffer through multiple airstrikes.

132
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,240
A BBC correspondent confirmed
the air strike in southern Gaza

133
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,750
a building near the Rafah crossing was damaged indeed.

134
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,750
According to the correspondent,

135
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,630
Israel hit the area near the
Rafah crossing point at least thrice.

136
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,190
This area is very important.

137
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,580
Look at this place carefully.

138
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,290
Rafah border crossing.

139
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,420
This is the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt.

140
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,690
If there is no safe place in Gaza,

141
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,600
people will obviously think of leaving Gaza.

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,620
On one side, there is the sea, where you cannot go.

143
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,420
On two sides, there is the country of
Israel, where you obviously cannot go.

144
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,030
So, the only place that you can flee to

145
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,270
is Egypt in the south.

146
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,830
And there is only one border crossing here.

147
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,740
The Rafah border crossing.

148
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,120
So, what would you have done in such a situation?

149
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,660
To escape the bombardment,

150
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,480
you would have tried to flee Gaza.

151
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,930
Thousands of people tried to do this

152
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,960
so they gathered at the Rafah border.

153
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,880
But Egypt is not ready to open this border.

154
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,160
Egypt and other Arab countries say that

155
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,040
it is unacceptable for Palestinian
refugees to go to their countries

156
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,080
because the Palestinians have their own country.

157
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,970
They cannot be thrown out of their own country.

158
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,770
In the midst of all this,

159
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,960
the danger of the war escalating is also rising

160
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,400
because clashes were seen in Israel and Lebanon.

161
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,110
North of Israel is Lebanon

162
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,190
where the H*zboll*h militant group operates.

163
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,840
Like the Ham*s group,

164
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,060
H*zboll*h is also backed by Iran

165
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,280
and there has already been
a war between H*zboll*h and Israel

166
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,510
in 2006, which lasted for a month.

167
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,940
Here, I'd like to tell you that

168
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,810

193
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,510
And now let's get back to the topic.

194
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,760
What has happened now is that

195
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,830
in the last few days,

196
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,370
there has been a brief r*cket
firing between H*zboll*h and Israel.

197
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,790
On 16th  October, an anti-tank
missile was fired from Lebanon

198
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,400
which fell on a town in northern Israel,

199
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,200
and injured three people.

200
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,150
Israel has ordered its civilians

201
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,980
to evacuate the area near the Lebanon border.

202
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,000
The biggest threat here is that

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,420
H*zboll*h is actually more dangerous than Ham*s

204
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,030
and more powerful.

205
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,490
They have lakhs of r*ckets and missiles

206
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,240
which can attack anywhere in Israel.

207
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,420
On top of that, Iran has also warned Israel

208
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,370
that if Israel tries to do a ground invasion in Gaza,

209
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,620
that is, if it deploys its army to Gaza on the ground,

210
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,060
it can get a response from other places.

211
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,770
It should also be noted here that

212
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,810
around 900 Indian troops

213
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,900
are stationed at the Israel-Lebanon border.

214
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,770
They are a part of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force.

215
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,730
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.

216
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,760
Our Indian troops have been stationed there since 1978.

217
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,120
On 15th October it was reported that

218
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,620
a r*cket shell fell near the site in southern Lebanon.

219
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,290
Thankfully, no casualties were reported.

220
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,270
It is still a big mystery

221
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,750
how could Ham*s collect more than 5,000 r*ckets in Gaza

222
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,490
and how was Israel completely unaware of it?

223
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,200
In the last video, I said that

224
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,490
Egypt had already warned Israel that

225
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,750
an attack was imminent.

226
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,310
Later it was found that

227
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,180
America also had information about it

228
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,950
and they also warned Israel too.

229
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,340
There was an update on 28th September

230
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,920
by multiple streams of intelligence that

231
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,720
Ham*s can launch r*cket attacks across the border.

232
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,470
On 6th October, one day before the attack,

233
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,380
American officials circulated a report

234
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,540
that Ham*s was showing unusual activity.

235
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,990
And an attack could happen at anytime.

236
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,630
A Middle Eastern diplomat in Washington DC told CNN

237
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,610
that his government

238
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,540
was repeatedly warning the White House
and thw US intelligence officials

239
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,820
that there was a build-up of weapons by Ham*s.

240
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,230
He also said that

241
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,440
they have so many weapons in Gaza

242
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,480
that it was 'beyond anybody's imagination.'

243
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,780
So, obviously, the question arises,

244
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,270
did the Israeli government already know about this attack

245
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,190
and they did nothing?

246
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,590
Here, take a look at Israel's internal politics as well.

247
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,620
I had talked about this in this video.

248
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,310
For the past few years,

249
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,800
Israel's politics has been quite unstable.

250
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,580
Many elections were held

251
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,000
and the current Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,

252
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,070
has been charged with fraud,

253
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,150
breach of trust, and

254
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,560
taking bribery in three different scandals.

255
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,960
Allegations are that billionaires have given him money.

256
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,850
He denies this

257
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,960
but a corruption trial is going on

258
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,980
against Netanyahu which include

259
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,560
Cases 1000, 2000, and 4000.

260
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,150
These trials are pending.

261
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,530
I told you in this video

262
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,520
how Prime Minister Netanyahu

263
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,740
is trying to interfere with the judiciary.

264
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,790
He is trying to change this process

265
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,790
of how judges are selected.

266
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,750
Citizens in Israel were out on the streets,

267
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,380
there were nationwide protests in Israel a while back.

268
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,680
Here, you might recall the same lines of Rahat Indori.

269
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,690
"Is there a lot of tension at the borders?

270
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,640
Find out if the election is around the corner."

271
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,340
Since the start of this war,

272
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,980
Netanyahu has used emergency powers

273
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,250
to keep his position secure.

274
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,690
Had this war not happened,

275
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,780
and the corruption trial against him went on as scheduled,

276
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,280
would he have had to resign
from his Prime Ministerial position?

277
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,600
That's another important question.

278
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,770
Apart from this, another allegation
that is being put on Netanyahu is that

279
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,230
he tried to encourage the Ham*s group in the past.

280
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,170
On one hand, there was the great
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,

281
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,440
whom I talked about in the
video on Israel-Palestine history.

282
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,070
He tried unrelentingly to bring
peace between Israel and Palestine.

283
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,500
The peace process was almost over

284
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,100
when a fanatic shot him.

285
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,450
On the other hand, what did Netanyahu do?

286
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,350
He leads a right-wing government

287
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,750
with the chest-thumping approach.

288
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,650
He divided the power between Gaza Strip and West Bank.

289
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,190
He ignored the legitimate
Palestinian Authority and President

290
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,600
And Ham*s, a t*rr*rist organisation,

291
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,630
he tried to negotiate with
them indirectly through Egypt.

292
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,280
Look at this article in The Telegraph.

293
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,640
"How Benjamin Netanyahu empowered Ham*s

294
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,570
and broke Israel"

295
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,410
This 18th October article

296
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,490
from the Times of Israel.

297
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,030
"For years, Netanyahu propped up Ham*s

298
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,070
Now it's blown up in our faces"

299
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,260
It states that, according to several reports,

300
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,100
Netanyahu had said that

301
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,610
they should facilitate transfer funds to Gaza

302
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,270
so that there can be a separation

303
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,980
between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank

304
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,490
and Ham*s in Gaza.

305
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,140
He said that this gap would ensure,

306
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,750
that a Palestinian state will never be formed.

307
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,590
An extreme right-wing politician from his political party

308
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,170
had made a statement in 2015

309
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,750
that Israel's policy is to treat
the Palestinian Authority as a burden

310
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,880
and treat Ham*s as an asset.

311
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,290
The Israeli government allowed

312
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,910
suitcases with millions of
dollars from Qatar to enter Gaza

313
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,460
to benefit Ham*s in 2018.

314
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,500
These may seem shocking to you

315
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,680
but the majority of the Israeli
public already knows about these things.

316
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,020
Because thankfully the Israeli media

317
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,180
is still free.

318
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,840
It does not sit in their government's lap.

319
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,210
This is the reason why according to the latest polls,

320
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,850
the approval rating of Netanyahu has been falling rapidly

321
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,370
since the war started.

322
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,470
According to a recent poll,

323
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,480
only 29% of the Israelis

324
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,440
support Netanyahu now.

325
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,450
This has reached an all-time low.

326
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,270
Israel is now witnessing protests

327
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,840
against Netanyahu's government.

328
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,950
People are venting their anger on Netanyahu.

329
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,900
With placards in their hands.

330
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,940
"Bibi, you have bl00d on your hands."

331
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,300
"Go to jail, Bibi."

332
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,680
In another incident, an angry mob

333
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,030
shouted at the Israeli Cabinet Minister

334
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,490
outside a hospital.

335
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,440
And the minister had to go back.

336
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,150
That person said,

337
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,470
now it's time for them to take control.

338
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,910
Them as in Israeli civilians.

339
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,680
That's why I say,

340
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,720
never have blind faith in any
government, organization, or group.

341
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,030
Always take the side of humanity

342
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,650
and think about the common people.

343
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,860
Whether they are the common people living in Israel

344
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,630
or the common people living in Gaza.

345
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,470
Now you can click here to
watch the video on the Israel protests

346
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,980
from a few months ago,

347
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,830
when Netanyahu tried to take over the judiciary.

348
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,380
Thank you very much!
