00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,046
Hello, friends.

2
00:00:01,046 --> 00:00:03,654
On 24th December 1999,

3
00:00:03,654 --> 00:00:06,365
Indian Airlines flight IC 814,

4
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:08,448
Took off from Kathmandu.

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,579
This flight was headed to Delhi.

6
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:14,777
It usually takes 2 hours
to fly from Kathmandu to Delhi.

7
00:00:14,777 --> 00:00:18,131
But the passengers and crew members on this flight

8
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:20,239
Were unaware that for them,

9
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,350
reaching Delhi would take a much longer time.

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,480
5 people hijacked this plane.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,467
These hijackers asked for $200 million

12
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:33,295
from the Indian Government 
to free the passengers.

13
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:35,710
They had some additional demands as well,

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,198
Such as releasing some terrorists from jail.

15
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:42,000
The entire country held their breath for the next 7 days

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,862
And watched this unfold on their television screens.

17
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:49,545
This hijacking was the biggest hijacking in Indian history,

18
00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:51,659
And the last plane hijacking.

19
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,033
Yup, that’s right friends,

20
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:57,643
Fortunately, since then, no other plane has been hijacked in India.

21
00:00:57,643 --> 00:01:00,701
Come, let’s understand this entire incident in detail.

22
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:03,961
"24 December 1999."

23
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:07,434
"An Indian airplane flying from Kathmandu to Delhi

24
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,130
was hijacked today."

25
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,658
"The plane was carrying 11 crew members,

26
00:01:11,658 --> 00:01:14,202
and 179 passengers."

27
00:01:14,202 --> 00:01:17,687
"We were blindfolded, all of us,
with our heads down."

28
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:20,625
"Their safety was our first priority."

29
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:23,278
"We have evidence to show that hijackers

30
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:25,786
were encouraged by Pakistan."

31
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:32,099
A little after this flight took off from Kathmandu,

32
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,433
The passengers of this flight were served food.

33
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:36,680
And while they were having lunch,

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,224
Suddenly, 4 masked men stood up

35
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:42,627
And started taking away the food.

36
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:47,061
They announced that the plane had been hijacked.

37
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:50,075
The hijackers went into the pilot’s cabin,

38
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:52,360
And with Capt Devi Sharan at gunpoint,

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,888
He was instructed to keep flying westwards.

40
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:59,728
Actually, the hijackers wanted to take this plane to Pakistan.

41
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:02,994
So this plane kept flying beyond Delhi towards Pakistan.

42
00:02:02,994 --> 00:02:05,540
Specifically, to Lahore’s airport.

43
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,374
But the Pakistani air traffic controllers in Lahore

44
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:12,865
Strictly forbade the flight from landing in their territory.

45
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:15,541
On the other hand, the Indian air traffic controllers

46
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,821
came to know about this hijacking at 4:40 PM.

47
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:22,444
And interestingly, our incumbent Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee,

48
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:24,993
And his Principal Secretary Brajesh Mishra

49
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:29,869
came to know about this one hour later,
at 5:20 PM.

50
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:32,414
At 06:04 PM, the Indian air traffic control

51
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:36,151
tried to establish communication with flight IC814.

52
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:39,598
Capt Devi Sharan tells them that the plane was running low on fuel.

53
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,560
And they weren’t permitted to land in Lahore.

54
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,922
The captain requests the Indian air traffic control

55
00:02:44,922 --> 00:02:47,201
to ask their Pakistani counterparts

56
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,408
To grant them permission to land in Lahore.

57
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:50,942
Because the hijackers were getting frustrated.

58
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:54,082
The hijackers were threatening to kill the passengers

59
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:56,355
If they weren’t allowed to land in Pakistan.

60
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:58,293
At 6:30 in the evening,

61
00:02:58,293 --> 00:03:01,339
The Indian High Commission in Pakistan,
requests Pakistani authorities,

62
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:03,722
To allow the plane to land in Lahore.

63
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:05,849
But they weren’t granted permission.

64
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:10,083
Meanwhile, Capt Devi Sharan tried to talk to the hijackers,

65
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,470
To tell them that the plane was running low on fuel,

66
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,669
And that they couldn’t keep waiting for permission,

67
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:17,625
They had to land somewhere and refuel.

68
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,628
He proved successful in convincing the hijackers.

69
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:25,841
And the hijackers agree to have the plane land in Amritsar,

70
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,172
For refuelling.

71
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:31,977
At 6:44 PM, the flight starts descending towards Amritsar.

72
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:35,284
Friends, the hijackers did not want this to happen.

73
00:03:35,284 --> 00:03:37,253
They had hijacked an Indian plane,

74
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:39,417
And to have it land in India,

75
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:43,616
Would give a huge upper hand to the Indian government and authorities.

76
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:47,500
In this crisis, this situation was very advantageous for India.

77
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,984
The Indian forces could now get better control over the situation

78
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:53,910
Because the plane was about to land in India.

79
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,813
But what happened next, turned out to be a historic blunder.

80
00:03:57,813 --> 00:04:00,506
Subramanian Swamy describes this incident

81
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:04,299
 

82
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:07,257
What did the Indian authorities do wrong?

83
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:09,678
There was not one, but several mistakes.

84
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:13,592
At 7:01 PM, the flight landed at Amritsar airport.

85
00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:18,103
Immediately, they request that the flight be refuelled.

86
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:21,115
Amazingly, Punjab’s Director General of Police

87
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,762
Sarabjit Singh was informed about this hijacking

88
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:26,432
1 hour earlier around 6 PM.

89
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,699
And not through other official sources

90
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:30,304
But through the TV news.

91
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:33,114
Can you imagine the scale of the communication failure here?

92
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:38,561
Such an important officer got to know about this hijacking while watching TV.

93
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:41,702
After this hijacking, a crisis management group was formed.

94
00:04:41,702 --> 00:04:45,290
And a local committee with the purpose of

95
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,646
delaying the plane as much as possible.

96
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:52,143
This would allow more time for the commandos to develop a strategy

97
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:54,655
And to conduct some operations on the ground.

98
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,568
But the hijackers in the plane

99
00:04:56,568 --> 00:04:59,656
Refused to communicate with the local police officials.

100
00:04:59,656 --> 00:05:03,582
They wanted to communicate with the officials in Delhi.

101
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:06,818
But this communication couldn’t be effective.

102
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:12,040
Captain Devi Sharan requested again to have the plane refuelled.

103
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,078
If it wasn’t refuelled, the hijackers were threatening to attack the passengers.

104
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:19,969
They would start killing the passengers.

105
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:21,394
5 minutes passed.

106
00:05:21,394 --> 00:05:23,267
10 minutes.
15 minutes.

107
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:25,088
No refuelling was initiated.

108
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:28,696
Hijackers actually attacked a person.

109
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,227
Satnam Singh.

110
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:33,847
They used a knife to injure his neck.

111
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:36,389
Once again, Captain Devi Sharan requested

112
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:38,885
To refuel the plane immediately.

113
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:41,438
40 minutes pass like this.

114
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:45,024
By 7:45 PM, the Crisis Management Group formulates a plan

115
00:05:45,024 --> 00:05:46,386
And gave orders to the Punjab Police.

116
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:51,818
They decided to take advantage of the fuel tanker fuelling the plane

117
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,323
to hide some officers of the Punjab Police

118
00:05:54,323 --> 00:05:57,878
So that they could go and puncture the tires of the plane.

119
00:05:57,878 --> 00:06:00,439
With damaged tires, the plane would not be able to take off again.

120
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,798
It was a good plan,

121
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:03,916
But before this plan could be brought into action,

122
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,225
The ATC came up with another plan.

123
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:08,505
Why not place a fuel tanker in front of the plane

124
00:06:08,505 --> 00:06:09,638
To block its way?

125
00:06:09,638 --> 00:06:12,764
So a fuel tanker started moving towards the plane.

126
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:16,213
But the driver of the fuel tanker was driving it a bit too fast.

127
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:19,641
So the ATC was worried that the speed of the tanker

128
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:22,258
May tip off the hijackers that they were planning on doing something.

129
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:25,884
So the driver was asked to drive slowly.

130
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:27,167
And the driver,

131
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,219
due to miscommunication or something else,

132
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:31,416
Suddenly stopped the fuel tanker.

133
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:35,410
The hijackers and the captain in the cockpit of the plane,

134
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,164
Saw this happening.

135
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:39,482
The hijackers were shocked to see this.

136
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,984
First, the tanker was moving towards them so fast,

137
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,458
And then it stopped suddenly.

138
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,977
They figured out something was wrong.

139
00:06:46,977 --> 00:06:48,771
This frustrated the hijackers.

140
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:50,394
They gave up on refuelling,

141
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:52,242
And wanted to take the plane back into the air.

142
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:53,573
Without refuelling.

143
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:56,562
Captain Sharan was pressurised into

144
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:58,558
having the plane take off

145
00:06:58,558 --> 00:07:01,479
By ignoring the fuel tanker,

146
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:02,814
Even if it meant hitting it,

147
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:04,318
They wanted the plane to be airborne.

148
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:08,057
Under pressure, Captain Sharan prepared to have the plane take off.

149
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:09,799
While speeding on the runway,

150
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:12,695
He barely avoided hitting the fuel tanker in front of them.

151
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:14,622
There was an accident almost.

152
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:18,946
But it didn’t happen, and once again the plane was in the air.

153
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:21,796
This happened exactly at 7:49 PM.

154
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:26,724
The moment when the NSG commandos reached the airport.

155
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:29,353
The operation backfired terribly.

156
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:33,145
The NSG Commandos didn’t get the chance to take any action.

157
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:37,727
And most importantly, the plane was still not refuelled.

158
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,031
While taking off, Capt Devi Sharan sent a message to the ATC.

159
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:44,470
“We are all dying.”

160
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,199
Lahore is just 50 km from Amritsar.

161
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,350
Once again, this flight turned towards Pakistan.

162
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:57,865
Once again, the ATC in Pakistan denied permission to land this plane in Lahore.

163
00:07:57,865 --> 00:08:03,669
They were worried that the hijackers would force the pilots to land the plane in Lahore.

164
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:08,293
So all lights were turned off at Pakistan’s airport.

165
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:12,303
All the navigational aids and lights in the airport were turned off.

166
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:14,467
So that even if they wanted to land the plane,

167
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:16,704
it would be exceedingly difficult without lights.

168
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:20,302
But Capt Sharan was under so much pressure from the hijackers,

169
00:08:20,302 --> 00:08:23,575
He couldn’t care whether the runway was visible or not.

170
00:08:23,575 --> 00:08:26,717
He had to land the plane, no matter where it was.

171
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:28,790
The place descended slowly,

172
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,180
And suddenly, Capt Sharan realised

173
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,068
That they were about to crash land on a highway.

174
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:39,065
Seeing this, he made a final request to Pakistan’s ATC.

175
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:41,220
That they will crash land on the highway

176
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,376
If they weren’t allowed to land at the airport.

177
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:49,342
Hearing this, finally, the ATC at Lahore agreed

178
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:53,768
And this plane landed in Lahore at 8:07 PM.

179
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:56,913
India tells Pakistan’s Airport Officials

180
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:59,695
To prevent this plane from taking off again.

181
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:03,715
India planned to send the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad,

182
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:08,796
G Parthasarathy, to negotiate with the hijackers.

183
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:13,664
At this airport in Pakistan, this plane was finally refuelled.

184
00:09:13,664 --> 00:09:16,369
And to prevent this plane from taking off once again,

185
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:18,597
Lights were turned off once again,

186
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:20,832
And their commandos surrounded the plane.

187
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:26,011
Apparently, the Pakistani forces tried to negotiate with the hijackers.

188
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:28,454
They asked them to release the children and female passengers.

189
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:30,611
But these negotiations failed.

190
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:35,465
Hijackers were frustrated that their negotiations couldn’t reach a solution.

191
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:38,438
Their demands weren’t fulfilled.

192
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:40,762
Another passenger was attacked.

193
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:42,248
Rupin Katyal.

194
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,010
A 25-year-old man from Gurgaon,

195
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,548
Returning with his wife from their honeymoon.

196
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:49,114
Rupin passed away later.

197
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:50,951
"One passenger, Rupin Katyal,

198
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:54,788
returning from his honeymoon,
was brutally stabbed to death."

199
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:59,216
Pakistan was tasked with providing a helicopter to the Indian High Commissioner.

200
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:01,947
So that he could reach Lahore for the negotiations as quickly as possible.

201
00:10:01,947 --> 00:10:05,254
But the helicopter was provided 3 hours late.

202
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:07,139
By the time he reached Lahore,

203
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,463
He found that the plane had taken off once again.

204
00:10:10,463 --> 00:10:13,772
How was this possible when all the lights at the airport were switched off?

205
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:16,815
And the plane was surrounded by the Commandoes,

206
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:18,686
How could the plane still take off?

207
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:20,877
We do not have much information about this.

208
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:23,938
But we get some clues later on in the story.

209
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:26,686
The flight was directed from Lahore to Oman.

210
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:30,485
But even there their permission to land was rejected.

211
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:35,466
The next landing of this flight was at Dubai’s Al Minhad Air Base.

212
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:37,527
Around 3:00 AM.

213
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:42,950
After relentless negotiation, the hijackers finally released 26 passengers here.

214
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,269
A special relief aircraft of Indian Airlines was called to Dubai

215
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:51,198
To take the passengers back to India.

216
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:55,278
The then Civil Aviation Minister Sharad Yadav was present on this flight.

217
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,663
And was accompanying the passengers to take them back to their homes safely.

218
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:04,373
Some important information was revealed by the passengers returning from Dubai

219
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,590
about this hijacked flight.

220
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,430
It was found that in the plane,

221
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,515
Men were segregated from women and children.

222
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:15,650
And everyone was blindfolded.

223
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,272
So that no one could see anything.

224
00:11:17,272 --> 00:11:21,835
Some women claimed that the hijackers were decently behaving towards them

225
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:24,060
And were quite affectionate with the children.

226
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,701
They said that there were 5 hijackers

227
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:29,113
And they had code names.

228
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:32,426
Their leader called himself the Chief.

229
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:37,155
And the four others were Burger, Doctor, Shankar and Bhola.

230
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,446
Obviously, these were the fake names they were using for the hijacking.

231
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:42,699
But we later found that their real names were

232
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,248
Most of the hijackers were from Pakistan.

233
00:11:52,248 --> 00:11:54,565
Captain and hostages later revealed that

234
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:58,563
Hijacker Burger kept people calm on the flight.

235
00:11:58,563 --> 00:12:02,102
By singing, making jokes, and simply by talking to them.

236
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:05,894
It was quite surprising that some hijackers were behaving like this

237
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:10,398
Because there were also stories of how people weren’t being given food.

238
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:13,283
A woman claimed that her child was crying because of hunger,

239
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:15,846
And the hijackers shouted at her to have the child shut up.

240
00:12:15,846 --> 00:12:17,182
1 day passed.

241
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:21,937
The passengers in the plane were in worse conditions.

242
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:24,108
Food and water were running low.

243
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:26,405
The toilets were in terrible condition.

244
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:28,460
The plane took off once again.

245
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,277
And this time, it flew to Afghanistan.

246
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:33,746
26th December, at 8 in the morning.

247
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:36,707
The plane landed at Kandahar International Airport.

248
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:40,649
After the landing, Taliban’s authorities present here

249
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:45,818
Offered to mediate between the hijackers and India.

250
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:50,394
That’s right, at this time, Taliban was in power in Afghanistan.

251
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:54,010
But India didn’t recognise the Talibani government.

252
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,284
So India sent an Indian High Commissioner from Islamabad to Kandahar,

253
00:12:58,284 --> 00:12:59,555
To negotiate.

254
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:03,670
The plane and its passengers remained there for the next 6 days.

255
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,672
6 days.

256
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:08,491
Even after everything, they were trapped there for 6 days.

257
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:11,232
They had no idea about what would happen next.

258
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:12,650
What their future held.

259
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,966
If they’d be killed there.

260
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:17,672
The Indian government was suspicious of Taliban’s real intentions.

261
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:21,604
Because this plane was surrounded by Taliban's members

262
00:13:21,604 --> 00:13:23,139
carrying weapons.

263
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:27,570
Taliban claims to have taken the action against the hijackers.

264
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,991
So that the hijackers wouldn't behave recklessly,

265
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:34,043
they had placed their members all around the plane as security.

266
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:36,163
But Indian analysts believe that

267
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:40,969
this was done so that India couldn't carry out military operations against the hijackers.

268
00:13:40,969 --> 00:13:44,879
Ajit Doval was a part of a special team

269
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,211
that was sent to Kandahar to negotiate with the terrorists.

270
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:53,188
They claim that the hijackers were getting support from active ISI in Kandahar.

271
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:56,477
That they were guaranteed to get a safe exit.

272
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:59,323
They claim that without ISI's involvement

273
00:13:59,323 --> 00:14:01,903
India could have better resolved this hijacking.

274
00:14:01,903 --> 00:14:04,914
Ajit Doval's story is very interesting on its own.

275
00:14:04,914 --> 00:14:07,128
If you want to know more about his life,

276
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:08,940
I recommend this audiobook to you,

277
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,875
Super Spy Ajit Doval.

00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:38,383
Now let's return to our topic.

289
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:41,593
Friends, the scenario in India was very tense.

290
00:14:41,593 --> 00:14:43,862
It was in 1999.

291
00:14:43,862 --> 00:14:46,741
The year of the Kargil War.

292
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:49,881
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried

293
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:52,589
to have peaceful relations with Pakistan.

294
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:53,818
But the efforts failed.

295
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:57,744
And this hijack was a sensitive issue for the Prime Minister's image.

296
00:14:57,744 --> 00:15:01,329
Many things are still not clear about this case.

297
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:03,140
Even now, we do not know

298
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,102
how the security was breached at Kathmandu's airport.

299
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:09,799
It's said that Dawood Ibrahim's Nepal network was used for this.

300
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:12,562
The mishandling by the Indian authorities

301
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:15,463
gave rise to a theory, that I'll discuss later in this video.

302
00:15:15,463 --> 00:15:17,565
Getting back to our timeline now,

303
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:22,097
the hijackers at Kandahar demanded $200 million.

304
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:25,840
They wanted to get ₹16.5 billion.

305
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,002
Additionally, they demanded the release of 36 prisoners.

306
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:32,272
Apart from this, they also demanded

307
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:35,978
the dead body of Sajjad Afghani, the founder of Harkat-Ul-Mujahideen.

308
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:38,047
These were outrageous demands.

309
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:41,900
They made high demands,
and asked for a lot of money.

310
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,179
But in India, the government was under different pressure.

311
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:51,003
On 26th December, External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh,

312
00:15:51,003 --> 00:15:53,058
was at a press conference regarding this hijacking.

313
00:15:53,623 --> 00:15:55,021
"The government has been

314
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:57,513
in constant touch

315
00:15:57,513 --> 00:15:59,021
with the negotiating team."

316
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:02,558
Suddenly, a mob of people disrupted this press conference.

317
00:16:02,558 --> 00:16:07,206
They were the family members and relatives of the passengers of the plane.

318
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:11,149
At this press conference, they ask the External Affairs minister

319
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:13,941
to fulfil the demand of the hijackers,

320
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:16,113
so that their loved ones could be safe.

321
00:16:20,316 --> 00:16:22,761
They refer to the December 1989 incident

322
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:26,297
10 years ago when Union Minister Mufti Mohammad Saeed's daughter

323
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:28,234
Rubiya Saeed was freed after

324
00:16:28,234 --> 00:16:30,469
the government released militants.

325
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:33,104
They stressed the importance of civilian lives,

326
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:35,907
they demanded that the government take action

327
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:38,933
to get their loved ones back into the country immediately. 

328
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:43,341
They believed that the safety of the passengers of the plane should be the number 1 priority.

329
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:46,627
Their safety trumped all else.

330
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:49,081
Whether that's a demand for the release of a prisoner,

331
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:51,349
or money, everything else was a second priority.

332
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:55,697
Everything was happening in front of External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh.

333
00:16:55,697 --> 00:16:59,857
But the Indian negotiators were yet to reach Kandahar.

334
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:02,805
They reached the next day, on 27th December.

335
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:05,978
The team of negotiators was led by Vivek Katju.

336
00:17:05,978 --> 00:17:09,260
He was the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs then.

337
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,529
And Home Ministry's official Ajit Doval,

338
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,103
The same day, the pressure on the government intensified.

339
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:17,364
when the relatives of some hostages gatecrashed

340
00:17:17,364 --> 00:17:18,962
into Rajiv Gandhi Bhawan,

341
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:21,714
where the Crisis Management Group was in a meeting.

342
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:25,422
Some people were protesting in front of the Prime Minister's residence.

343
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:30,854
Taliban clearly stated that they won't allow Indian forces to conduct rescue operations.

344
00:17:30,854 --> 00:17:34,625
But they do offer to negotiate on behalf of India.

345
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,440
And the negotiations went on so.

346
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,704
Taliban's leader Maulana Mohammad Umar,

347
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,729
told a Pakistani newspaper that

348
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:44,400
the hijackers should either leave the plane

349
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,276
or lay down their weapons.

350
00:17:46,276 --> 00:17:48,756
The negotiations lasted for days.

351
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:51,193
The team of Indian negotiators were placed there,

352
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:53,758
with the Taliban in between them and the hijackers.

353
00:17:53,758 --> 00:17:58,260
Ultimately, the demands of the hijackers could be narrowed down by a lot.

354
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,520
Only 3 prisoners were to be released instead of 36.

355
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,694
The credit for bringing down the demands of the hijackers

356
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:07,621
is given to both, the Indian negotiators and Taliban.

357
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:09,993
Coming back to the hijacking, by the 5th day,

358
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:11,964
the toilets in the plane were overflowing.

359
00:18:11,964 --> 00:18:13,919
People were losing hope.

360
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,391
The RAW Chief back then, A. S. Dulat,

361
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:19,431
reached Jammu on 30th December.

362
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,848
He tried to convince Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah,

363
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:26,203
to release 2 prisoners.

364
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:28,972
Farooq Abdullah was very reluctant.

365
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:32,912
He argued that this would have a negative impact later on.

366
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,635
As we see now, it did.

367
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:38,105
But eventually, the pressure was so intense back then.

368
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:40,588
That he was forced to abide by the demands.

369
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:42,601
The prisoners were transported to Delhi.

370
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:46,762
And were placed on a flight with External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh.

371
00:18:46,762 --> 00:18:48,569
Off they went to Kandahar.

372
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:50,885
The next day, 31st December.

373
00:18:50,885 --> 00:18:53,447
The demands of the hijackers were met

374
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:57,466
and 3 prisoners were released in Kandahar.

375
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:59,609
On the other hand, the hijackers,

376
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:01,995
released the passengers of the plane.

377
00:19:01,995 --> 00:19:04,529
At this point in time, the Indian team had expected that

378
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:07,372
the hijackers would be arrested by Taliban.

379
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:09,272
But they didn't do this.

380
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:12,582
Taliban's supreme leader and another Talibani member

381
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:16,479
put the hijackers and the released terrorists in a vehicle,

382
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:18,287
and drove towards the border.

383
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:20,111
Towards Pakistan's border.

384
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:22,675
By this point in time, it was clear to India,

385
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:25,775
about Pakistan's involvement in this hijacking.

386
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:28,126
"2 of the released persons have surfaced there.

387
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,239
Only goes to confirm

388
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:32,527
that Pakistan is neck deep

389
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:35,280
in this dirty game of hijacking."

390
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,089
Harkat was a Pakistan-based militant group,

391
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,731
active in PoK,

392
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:43,053
and 33 prisoners out of the 36 whose release was demanded,

393
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:44,854
were Pakistanis.

394
00:19:44,854 --> 00:19:48,920
These hijackers safely crossed the border to reach Pakistan.

395
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,540
On the other hand, the passengers were finally safe.

396
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,215
Several passengers were injured

397
00:19:54,215 --> 00:19:57,269
and most of them were starving.

398
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:00,754
On 31st December, they came home.

399
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:02,624
The plane that was hijacked,

400
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:05,554
was retired in 2001,

401
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:07,795
because it was already a 20-year-old plane.

402
00:20:07,795 --> 00:20:10,854
The blame for this incident obviously falls on the hijackers.

403
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:13,346
And the stakeholders supporting them.

404
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,792
Whether that's Taliban or the Pakistani forces.

405
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:19,255
But along with this, the incumbent government

406
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:21,411
was also criticised.

407
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:25,034
How terribly they failed at dealing with this crisis.

408
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:26,878
When this plane was in Amritsar,

409
00:20:26,878 --> 00:20:29,494
it was a golden opportunity for the Indian forces,

410
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,392
to regain control of the plane.

411
00:20:31,392 --> 00:20:33,926
But the big blunders committed by the government,

412
00:20:33,926 --> 00:20:36,701
could be labelled as a communication gap.

413
00:20:37,297 --> 00:20:39,290
But as a result of these blunders,

414
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,598
the Jaish-e-Mohammad group was later formed.

415
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:44,946
And we witnessed these attacks.

416
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:50,410
Another shocking reveal from Amritsar's controversy surfaced.

417
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,530
The RAW Chief tells us,

418
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,729
how among the passengers in the plane

419
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:58,437
Shashi Bhushan Singh Tomar was one of them.

420
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:01,101
The brother-in-law of N K Singh.

421
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:04,768
And N K Singh was Prime Minister Vajpayee's Secretary.

422
00:21:04,768 --> 00:21:08,272
It's said that the plane was allowed to take off from Amritsar,

423
00:21:08,272 --> 00:21:10,749
to ensure Tomar's safety.

424
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:15,749
If Tomar's safety played even a minute part in Amritsar's lost chance,

425
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:19,605
it was a shameful act by the authorities.

426
00:21:19,605 --> 00:21:21,246
The other shocking thing was that

427
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:25,379
many of the top leaders of the nation came to know about the hijacking,

428
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:26,705
through the TV news.

429
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:29,045
Instead of their communication channels.

430
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:30,675
Such as LK Advani,

431
00:21:30,675 --> 00:21:32,003
the then Home Minister.

432
00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:35,198
He says that he came to know about this incident,

433
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:36,339
through the news programs.

434
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:38,091
Instead of being informed by the Crisis Management Group.

435
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:40,673
At the end of this story, there is some good news.

436
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:43,033
And it's that since then

437
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:46,074
there has been no other hijacking incident in the country.

438
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:49,532
The regulations and processes have been made so strict that

439
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:52,909
it has become extremely difficult to hijack any plane.

440
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:54,766
What are these safety measures?

441
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:57,250
let's discuss them in detail in some future video.

442
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,491

Or India's worst plane crash.

446
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:06,895
And I'll see you in the next video.

447
