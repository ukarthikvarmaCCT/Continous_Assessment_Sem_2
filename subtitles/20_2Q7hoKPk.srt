1
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,017
Come on, in!
- Yes, I'm here.

2
00:01:06,237 --> 00:01:07,666
Just say the word.

3
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,845
Where are we
with the Myntra designs?

4
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:13,200
And is the meeting
with king set up?

5
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:16,250
I need these designs approved asap.

6
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,587
If you're going to
meet this deadline...

7
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:19,071
And we're going to meet it. Okay?

8
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:23,486
Listen, those are too many words.
And not a single one sounded good.

9
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:27,757
Well, I've sent the presentation.
Did you check?

10
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:29,699
Yeah, I saw it.

11
00:01:29,947 --> 00:01:32,182
And?
- There's too many ruffles. Okay?

12
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:34,004
They're not working for me.
Neither are the...

13
00:01:34,124 --> 00:01:36,542
The pleats and the patchwork...
I mean...

14
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:38,731
I need something that's a little
more ramp. - Listen, chill.

15
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:41,030
Let's go out, have a drink.

16
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,899
And let's discuss it over a drink.

17
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,694
You are young and single.

18
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:47,048
No, I'm hoping
you're single considering...

19
00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:48,687
...you spend all your time here.

20
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:50,437
Yeah, I'm a loser. Okay?

21
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:53,048
But I keep my professional
and personal life separate.

22
00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:54,211
Anyway, thanks.

23
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,684
You go, enjoy yourself,
have a drink.

24
00:01:56,804 --> 00:01:58,718
I'm going to finish our work.
- Okay.

25
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:01,017
Bye. Good luck.

26
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:04,855
Okay.

27
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,521
I'm still here.

28
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,241
Thank you.

29
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,865
Bro, we're going to lose.
- Yes, loser.

30
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:23,679
Hey.

31
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,798
Oh!
- Whoa!

32
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:31,135
Crap!

33
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:36,110
Ooh! We go!

34
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,359
We go!

35
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:06,092
I hope you know he is not
the real Gaurav from 'Going wrong'.

36
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:08,135
He is fake.
- Yeah, actually I'm the fake one.

37
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,564
Yeah.

38
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:12,550
Yes, creep.
- I was kidding.

39
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:18,131
What would I have done without you?
- You would've been lame.

40
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:21,337
Well... - Hey, listen.
Your taste isn't bad.

41
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:23,005
Got it?
- Right.

42
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,810
You see that place, over there?
- Yes.

43
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,036
That's exactly where
I'm going to perform.

44
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:31,085
You won the Indian challenge!
- Hey, it's not that bad. Right?

45
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:32,477
No!
- You're glad you came, right?

46
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:34,300
Yes.
- Who wrote the pallet?

47
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,654
Actually, there was no ink
in the printer.

48
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:39,366
And I had to send
the designs because...

49
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:43,342
...my designs are heading
this season's evolution trunk.

50
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:44,808
It's very deep.

51
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:45,916
Isn't it?
- Yes.

52
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:48,399
You're so much nicer when you
like your clothes, you know that?

53
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,643
I'm always nice to you.
Okay, stop it.

54
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:53,932
Well, that depends how you
describe 'always'.

55
00:03:54,473 --> 00:03:56,855
Anyway, I'll call your drinks.

56
00:03:57,735 --> 00:04:00,098
So, how are you coping up with...

57
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,967
...Raghav's exit?

58
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:08,021
Don't look at me like that.
- I'm just asking you.

59
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:09,679
I'm fine.
- Are you?

60
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,035
Yes.

61
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:15,120
I knew he was going back to London.
So, I'm mentally prepared.

62
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,785
So, have you deleted his number?

63
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,313
I never dial once I'm drunk.

64
00:04:22,624 --> 00:04:25,106
Okay, cool.
Give his number to me then.

65
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:27,781
Why do you want it?
- I like that guy.

66
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,410
He is a nice guy, he is in London
and he knows a lot of people.

67
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,709
You are my friend,
you cannot hang out with him.

68
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:34,677
But why? This is not fair.
- That's it.

69
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:36,516
End of discussion!
- Hey!

70
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:37,996
He is my Ex.
- So?

71
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:39,381
You can't do this.

72
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,464
Fine. If you have a problem...

73
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:51,358
No!

74
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:55,140
Darn it!

75
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,605
This was the moment...

76
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:58,415
We were waiting for this!

77
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:00,929
Oh, God!
It was such an awesome batch.

78
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:02,417
The carpet was awesome too.

79
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:05,392
Deva, are you serious?

80
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:07,202
They left because of you,
didn't they?

81
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,921
I'm alone... - Did you even
notice I was at home?

82
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:13,372
How does that matter?
Do you watch football?

83
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:16,531
It does matter. I was in the kitchen
cleaning after you and your friends.

84
00:05:16,795 --> 00:05:18,869
Oh! Wow!

85
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:21,338
This is such a classic... It's...

86
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,398
Fantastic! Just because
I'm enjoying my evening...

87
00:05:23,518 --> 00:05:25,516
...I'm happy watching this match
and my friends are here...

88
00:05:25,636 --> 00:05:27,971
...but you have to make sure,
you put up this drama!

89
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:29,488
You can't sleep without it,
is it? - Dev.

90
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:31,672
I was in irritating meetings
since morning.

91
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:33,915
And when I come back home,
I just want to relax.

92
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:35,607
I don't want to take care of
you and your friends and...

93
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:37,256
...take care of
this house or do anything.

94
00:05:37,376 --> 00:05:39,249
So, don't even talk to me about
drama right now. - What should I do?

95
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:40,443
You want me to keep
the cushions here?

96
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:41,549
Yeah?
- Please! Don't do anything.

97
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:43,074
Yeah? Something else?
- Don't do anything!

98
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,826
Can I watch my match now?

99
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:49,742
Thank you so much.
- You're doing that anyway.

100
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,908
Okay...

101
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:57,063
Do you ever wonder
what happened to 2008 batch?

102
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:58,983
Like, where are they?
How are they? - Yes.

103
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:00,683
I think about them every day.

104
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,743
Really?
- No.

105
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:05,469
Okay, so this might...

106
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:07,271
...interest you.

107
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,233
Open.

108
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,113
Yes? No?

109
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:17,678
Maybe?
- Uh! No.

110
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,921
Why?
- Why would I go?

111
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:22,435
And who goes to these things?
- I do.

112
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:24,875
Yes, you're really cool.

113
00:06:25,124 --> 00:06:26,876
So are you.
- Great!

114
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:29,449
You will thank me
in a while, of course.

115
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,051
Yes! We're done!

116
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:35,386
You've made a group?

117
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,984
You added me to the group?

118
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,676
I love you too.

119
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:40,985
Delete me now.
- Of course.

120
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:44,546
There's a ten year school
reunion next month. Dev!

121
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:47,170
Dev.

122
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:49,837
Dev. Dev!

123
00:06:50,335 --> 00:06:51,435
Dev!

124
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,659
What have I done now?
- Nothing.

125
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,465
I'm talking to you.

126
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:00,682
Anyway, there's a reunion
next month. - I'm aware.

127
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:03,643
It's mentioned in the group.
- Group?! Which one?

128
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:07,461
Here.

129
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:20,151
Where's your phone?

130
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,736
It's on charging.

131
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,031
Should we go?

132
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:26,907
I want to go.

133
00:07:36,428 --> 00:07:38,576
Thank you so much
for coming with me, G.

134
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:40,972
I would've forgotten this file.

135
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:42,628
It's okay.

136
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:46,087
By the way, Piya is in
and so is Sam. And that...

137
00:07:46,798 --> 00:07:49,590
Diptanshu is out! So happy.
I never liked him.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,319
Aww...

139
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:55,642
Do you think
that Piya still has those...

140
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,646
Do they grow, with age?

141
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:02,355
Say yes.

142
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:04,817
I think they do grow.

143
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:07,507
Hey! I'm talking about the group.

144
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:09,499
The reunion.
- No!

145
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:12,086
I'm not coming
for the stupid reunion. - It's not!

146
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:13,837
It's not stupid.
- Yes, it is.

147
00:08:13,957 --> 00:08:15,069
It's not.

148
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,949
Dating Raghav has just made
you this uptight person.

149
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:20,983
Hey! - You haven't
met them for 10 years!

150
00:08:21,386 --> 00:08:22,587
I mean it will be fun to see if...

151
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:24,390
...people have changed
or not at all.

152
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,267
Just do me a favour.
Just give it a thought.

153
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:29,542
Please.

154
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:30,964
G...

155
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:34,591
If I wanted to see somebody
from school, I would have by now.

156
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:38,130
And everyone who I want in
my life is alrready in it.

157
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:40,146
Like you.
- I know.

158
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,571
Thanks. But that's not true.

159
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:47,767
If I tell you something,
you won't believe me.

160
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:50,684
But let me tell you something,
you still miss Deva.

161
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:52,304
Okay!

162
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:55,374
No.

163
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:58,459
I haven't thought about her
for a long time.

164
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,974
Ans she doesn't miss me.

165
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,165
Where is the pickle from Aarya?

166
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:05,356
It had fungus, so I threw it away.

167
00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:07,680
What else did you throw away?

168
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:11,204
My electric shaver is missing too.

169
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,882
That got spoilt.

170
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,079
You would have got a shock.

171
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:19,293
That didn't happen with
your taunts though, right?

172
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:24,489
You know, if you didn't insist
on being this man child...

173
00:09:24,609 --> 00:09:26,739
...there would have been
no need for me to taunt.

174
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,417
I know. I know all this lecture.

175
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:30,945
If you know everything,
you can try to change atleast.

176
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:34,455
What do you mean?
- I mean, I am fed up...

177
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,141
...of your childish behaviour.

178
00:09:36,261 --> 00:09:38,596
I have a life and I'd really
like to go and live it...

179
00:09:38,716 --> 00:09:40,282
...but I am out of such...
- Hold on.

180
00:09:40,402 --> 00:09:42,730
I didn't ask you to do that.
You are doing it by yourself.

181
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:45,404
In fact, it would be
better if you don't do it.

182
00:09:45,524 --> 00:09:46,884
Yes, because it's a perfect life.

183
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,010
You don't go to work.
You stay at home and drink.

184
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,490
Watching stupid...
- This is also my house.

185
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,996
I am paying the rent
for the last four months.

186
00:09:56,082 --> 00:09:59,511
I'm chasing my dream
and it takes time.

187
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:02,656
How would you know about it?
You don't have any dreams.

188
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,147
You're living your
comfortable life.

189
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:09,419
Dev, I did and you know it.

190
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:12,034
Then we got married
and life happened...

191
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,358
...but I knew that I
have responsibilities...

192
00:10:14,478 --> 00:10:15,985
...and we worked
together as a team.

193
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:19,458
I know that we are us
and we were never just I.

194
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:23,541
Was that supposed to be
an explanation? - Oh, shut up.

195
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,260
Okay, let's recall.

196
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:29,483
We met in school
and started dating.

197
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,546
And then suddenly we got married
because that was your right time.

198
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:35,603
Then you wanted to move to US
because that was your right time.

199
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:37,430
And you wanted to do
a family planning...

200
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,285
...because that was your
bloody right time.

201
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:41,899
Did you ever think that was
the right time for me?

202
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,746
Your right time?

203
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:45,944
You never wanted to marry after
being together for seven years.

204
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:47,519
You wanted me to keep
waiting around for you...

205
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,911
...to figure out
what your right time was?

206
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:50,971
I wish I had spent those
years in chasing my dreams.

207
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,964
I would've really...
- You don't know that, Dev.

208
00:10:55,037 --> 00:10:57,111
You know everything.
- I do. - Wow!

209
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,472
So, you know very well where
the cushions have to be kept...

210
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,861
...because that's
how you planned it.

211
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:04,073
Wine glasses have
to be clean, right?

212
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:06,022
The bedsheets should
be clean, crisp...

213
00:11:06,142 --> 00:11:07,583
...and there shouldn't
be grease on it.

214
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:10,060
As per your plan.

215
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:12,456
We'll get married at the age of 25
because that's how you planned it.

216
00:11:12,576 --> 00:11:14,647
We'll plan our family at 29!
You know what?

217
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,427
Hell with you and your planning!

218
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:18,413
You spent your entire
life planning!

219
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:19,543
Have you ever realised?

220
00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:21,814
Have you ever lived
those moments with me?

221
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:28,086
I enjoyed being with you, Dev.

222
00:11:28,585 --> 00:11:30,893
I enjoyed being married to you.

223
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:33,634
I enjoyed doing up this house.

224
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:39,623
Why do we always
end up discussing this?

225
00:11:41,054 --> 00:11:42,481
Because all I wanted was...

226
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,518
...to watch and enjoy my match,

227
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,804
with my friends and my beer.

228
00:11:55,487 --> 00:11:56,689
Of course!

229
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:11,324
Hello!

230
00:13:11,444 --> 00:13:13,976
Seeing messages from
your reunion group...

231
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:16,138
That's why I called.

232
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:20,381
Is Deva coming?
- Dev said yes. So...

233
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:22,183
...I guess, yes.

234
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:23,465
Hang on!

235
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:27,459
Woah! Good Lord!

236
00:13:28,178 --> 00:13:30,574
Listen. Deva just replied.
She's coming!

237
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:32,208
Okay! Good night!

238
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:54,537
Good morning!

239
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,571
Yeah! Good morning!

240
00:14:01,058 --> 00:14:02,172
It's 8:30 in the morning.

241
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:04,935
Why don't you take a shower?
I've already put the breakfast on.

242
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:07,793
No, it's fine. I'm okay.

243
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:11,737
You drank quite a bit. Might
be nice if you had something.

244
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:14,242
It's alright. Thank you.

245
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:20,062
Okay, let me just cut to the chase.

246
00:14:20,348 --> 00:14:23,323
We're going to the reunion anyway.
They're expecting us, so...

247
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:26,871
...I was thinking whatever happens
here, should not happen there.

248
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:28,982
Can we...

249
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:31,100
...can we please be
nice to each other?

250
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,225
No name-calling, no sarcasm.

251
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:35,123
Let's just be nice.

252
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:37,204
Was this request for you or for me?

253
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:38,838
For both of us.

254
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:43,654
Listen, Deva.

255
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:47,326
I'll take my own time. Please.

256
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:53,093
Look, Dev. I...

257
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:56,530
I hate saying this, but we
used to be the perfect couple.

258
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:58,735
I mean, people used
to look up to us.

259
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:01,476
And we were in love
and we got married.

260
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:03,849
And I know we're...

261
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:05,777
...a little, but...

262
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:08,268
It's a rough patch
and it's just...

263
00:15:08,518 --> 00:15:10,379
If we go there like
this, fighting...

264
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:13,435
...in front of everyone.
Can we please just be...

265
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:15,802
End of the day,
you are just concerned...

266
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:18,366
...about what they'll think.

267
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:25,628
Okay, fine. Let's just be...

268
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,201
...cordial to each other.

269
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,194
Okay?

270
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:33,308
Just that.

271
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:36,386
Yeah.

272
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,292
"What do I think about now?"

273
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,961
"These passing winds say it all."

274
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:11,686
"We'll meet when at leisure..."

275
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:16,733
"All of us, will meet again."

276
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:22,906
"This life is so unpredictable!"

277
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:26,519
"Where is it leading us to?"

278
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:30,834
"I wish to revisit the old...

279
00:17:30,954 --> 00:17:35,476
...memories again."

280
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:50,449
G...

281
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:55,414
...when do we leave?

282
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,090
Hey, my brother!

283
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,767
Such drama!
- It's me, Kunal!

284
00:18:18,124 --> 00:18:19,391
Yaay!
- Woah!

285
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,674
Don't make a scene
just because you...

286
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:22,252
...think you've this new
found freedom. Please!

287
00:18:22,463 --> 00:18:23,799
I don't have his new found freedom?

288
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:24,984
Actually, I have it.

289
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,035
What's happening?
Why is he behaving like this?

290
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:29,304
I followed you because
I knew you were hurting.

291
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:30,957
It was hurting...

292
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,413
...10 years ago, too.
Where were you then?
