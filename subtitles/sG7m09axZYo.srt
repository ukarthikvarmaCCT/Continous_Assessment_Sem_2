1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,040
today I'm going to take up a very common

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,080
problem that a lot of English learners

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,720
face the problem is that they translate

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,820
their sentences from Hindi to English

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,769
whenever they are trying to speak

6
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,200
something in English and I know this

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,420
because of course it has happened to all

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,160
of us at some point of our lives

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,960
whenever we were trying to learn a new

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,710
language

11
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,689
we definitely faced this issue because

12
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,660
we are habitual to thinking in our

13
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,510
native language now the issue is that in

14
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,210
that process of translation a lot of

15
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,210
time is lost and the moment just

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,390
vanishes most of the times we lose the

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,460
moment the translation takes a lot of

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,160
energy a good effective conversation

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,460
requires snappiness it requires to think

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,920
on your toes that charm that is required

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,260
now let's address a few issues that are

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,059
connected to this problem is this good

23
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,239
or bad it is bad should it happen no it

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,489
should not happen will it happen yes it

25
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,370
will happen will it go away yes it will

26
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,649
go away I'm going to tell you how it is

27
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,120
going to go of it let us first

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,250
understand one thing it is not something

29
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,549
that happens in absolute that either you

30
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,560
are going to translate or you're not

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,990
going to translate at all no it is

32
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,090
something that will happen more in the

33
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,840
beginning and then eventually decrease

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,580
when the time passes and when your

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,159
practice happens it is going to decrease

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,270
to a very low level and then eventually

37
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,329
it will completely vanish here we agree

38
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,430
on one thing it is a continuum it's not

39
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,170
going to happen with the click of a

40
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,299
finger so how will it exactly happen

41
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,820
I'll show you this is you translating

42
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,270
every sentence and this is you who does

43
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,000
not have to translate anything at all so

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,520
how will this happen right now this is

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,420
like zero so zero and right now this is

46
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,640
you okay so you are translating

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,290
everything once you start practicing

48
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,930
okay this is you practicing giving it

49
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,540
time giving it a lot of energy this

50
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,180
keeps on coming down and as this comes

51
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,790
down this keeps on increasing little by

52
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,069
little little by little and then again

53
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,440
it keeps coming down and this comes here

54
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,180
okay now you're 50% through

55
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,760
eventually what will happen this you are

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,299
going to grow and this you is going to

57
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:23,409
become small and eventually this is what

58
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:27,909
it looks like you become this from this

59
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:29,920
let's talk about your instincts let's

60
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,890
talk about your intuition do you know

61
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,200
how to drive I'm sure most of you

62
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,510
already know how to drive so do you

63
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,939
remember your first day are driving the

64
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:41,170
person must be telling you about the

65
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,620
clutch the brake the gears how to keep a

66
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,359
little distance with the other cars and

67
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:48,730
which lane to take etcetera etcetera at

68
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,370
that time I'm sure it must have felt

69
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,709
cumbersome it must have felt difficult

70
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:56,680
but now when you drive don't you think

71
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,750
you don't have to think about it you

72
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,489
don't have to actually apply your mind a

73
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:03,010
lot of people drive listening to music

74
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,310
lot of them drive talking on the phone

75
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,989
which is absolutely wrong but they still

76
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,689
do so that means there comes a point in

77
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:12,909
your life when you don't have to any

78
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:15,760
further think when you have to drive you

79
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,859
don't have to think about driving that

80
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:19,720
is what I meant similarly it will happen

81
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,489
for any other skill whatever you're

82
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:23,819
trying to learn it will become automatic

83
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,280
initially it always faces friction but

84
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,010
when you keep providing it the fuel of

85
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,699
practice

86
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,680
every now and then you're giving that

87
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,329
signal to your mind that you're going to

88
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,650
do it you're going to do it you're going

89
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,090
to keep practicing you're going to keep

90
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,250
doing it you're going to keep working on

91
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,340
your language eventually your brain will

92
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,739
stop resisting the change it will start

93
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:48,099
accepting it ok and your brain is going

94
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,709
to actually start supporting you you

95
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,560
will not have to consciously try to

96
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,870
speak in English English is going to

97
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,329
flow out of your mouth it will just flow

98
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,849
like that now the point is how do we do

99
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,790
that ok I will answer this question with

100
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,849
another question you tell me how much

101
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,129
time in the last 30 days have you

102
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,930
actually given to learning English

103
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,919
have you actually given it 30 years in

104
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,070
the last 30 days and if I have to give

105
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,199
you a figure and I can assure you that

106
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,960
these many number of hours if you put in

107
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,389
into learning English you will

108
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:26,800
definitely be

109
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,259
able to speak proper English I'm not

110
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,539
saying advanced level English just a

111
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,210
basic level English you will be able to

112
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,280
speak with fluency if I give you a

113
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,650
figure will you be working on that I

114
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,750
have a figure for you I'm giving you a

115
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,090
figure of 1000 RS 1000 okay if you give

116
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,810
it 1000 hours you will be able to speak

117
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,800
fluent English basic fluent English that

118
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,590
is a very good book that I read just a

119
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,060
few years ago the name of the book is

120
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,849
mastery and it was written by Robert

121
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:07,719
Greene mastery has this point that when

122
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:10,060
you give something ten thousand hours

123
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,629
not one ten thousand hours you come to a

124
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:17,020
position that you are an expert of that

125
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,210
particular skill and now you are in a

126
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,129
position to teach that skill to other

127
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:23,500
people I'm not asking for ten thousand

128
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,180
hours from you because we don't have to

129
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,969
become experts we just need basics I'm

130
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:30,370
going to call it the 1000 hours rule if

131
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,039
you give it your 1000 hours I am

132
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,650
promising you you will be able to speak

133
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,560
proper fluent English with confidence

134
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,690
and without hesitation

135
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,279
one last fundamental that I'm going to

136
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,880
talk about with you today is effort

137
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,500
expectation ratio the name is itself

138
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,669
self explainatory

139
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:51,340
how much is your effort and how much is

140
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,560
your expectation the ratio right now is

141
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,539
pretty disturbed the effort that you're

142
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:58,120
putting in is around 10 which is pretty

143
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,430
low and the expectation that you have

144
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,110
out of yourself is pretty high it's

145
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,599
somewhere around 90 we need to maintain

146
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:07,960
this ratio a little we need to make the

147
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,629
effort more and expectation little so

148
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:12,699
the ratio instead of being one is to

149
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:15,639
nine should be nine is to one the effort

150
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,430
should be 90% and your expectation

151
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,590
should be 10% stop expecting too much

152
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,539
out of yourself at such an early stage

153
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:25,150
because as I said unless you give it

154
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,300
your 1000 hours no big thing is going to

155
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,940
happen for you and as a good teacher I

156
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,219
have a homework for you like always that

157
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:35,949
you have to listen to me carefully and

158
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:39,220
you have to do this you have to

159
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,460
in front of the mirror okay let's first

160
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,440
break the hesitation to ourselves and

161
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,270
then we will talk about breaking the

162
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,670
hesitation to the outside world so you

163
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,610
have to go stand in front of the mirror

164
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,860
of your room your washroom anywhere and

165
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,320
you have to speak to yourself for ten

166
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,320
minutes okay ten minutes that's all I

167
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,690
ask you for and once you do that come

168
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,080
back to the video comment done simple

169
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,060
keeping a record of your own growth is

170
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,070
very difficult it's important that

171
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,630
somebody else is watching over you you

172
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,430
can keep doing this in your regular days

173
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,520
keep doing it daily and keep informing

174
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,740
me I'll be more than happy to know tell

175
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,810
