1
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,510
Which brand?

2
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,500
As good as it intoxicates it's fine.

3
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,170
Any brand would do for me.

4
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,450
Watch your drink, you've to drive.

5
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,300
I can control the vehicle
even if I am drunk.

6
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,920
Listen to his crap. He's too much.

7
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,080
Who's banging on the door?

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,380
Hey, just check.

9
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,860
Yes, coming.

10
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,310
Who's that? Idiot!

11
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,300
I want matchstick
to light my cigarette.

12
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,900
I don't have any. Get lost.

13
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,550
Please give it. Listen. Hey.

14
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,940
I said I don't have it. Now, just go.

15
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,820
Listen...

16
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,500
Who's banging on the door?
Just check.

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,020
Why is this constant
banging on the door today?

18
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,220
I told you I don't
have any matchstick.

19
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,360
Now, leave.

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,530
- But... hey...
- I said leave.

21
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,650
I just want fire,
just need a matchstick.

22
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,620
Listen. Hey...

23
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,540
Now you will get beaten up.
This is my last warning.

24
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,900
You idiot...

25
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,820
Sir, this is the
only piece of land I've.

26
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,850
Show some mercy.

27
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,460
Have mercy.

28
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,330
Hey, my name is Daya.

29
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,580
What is it? Daya.

30
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:35,100
But I'm not merciful by nature.

31
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,980
Nana sir has liked your land.

32
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,780
Now, I want it.

33
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,260
Now, I want it.

34
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,660
Come on, sign.

35
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,870
Sign the documents. Come on.

36
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,810
You?!

37
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,310
Kill him.

38
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,840
Leave me!

39
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,110
Leave me.

40
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,090
Pardon me.

41
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,500
Pardon me, please.

42
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,340
Mistakes can be forgiven.

43
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,040
But misdeeds deserve punishment.

44
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,270
No.

45
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,640
- Jaggu.
- Yes.

46
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,260
I'm tensed about Rocky.

47
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,940
Rocky is backed by Sultan now.

48
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:18,010
If Sultan backs up somebody
he will surely destroy his enemies.

49
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,430
Don't worry. He will kill
all of them and return soon.

50
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,250
Hope he is safe.

51
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,050
Both of you are cowards.

52
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,680
Jaggu, I am really worried about him.

53
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,230
- I will go and see him.
- Yes, let's go.

54
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,590
Don't take pain, he will come back.

55
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,110
- Hey!
- Come...

56
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,590
Rocky, these girls?

57
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,300
Actually, we were partying
at our friend's farmhouse.

58
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,400
Suddenly we felt dizzy
and started vomiting.

59
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,910
- Gaikwad sir.
- Yes.

60
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,650
Found more bodies downstairs.

61
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,220
- Ambulance is already here.
- Okay.

62
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:04,620
My darling, sweetheart.
Let me love you.

63
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,860
- To hell with this phone.
- Let it be.

64
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,900
Hello.

65
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,770
- Kale sir.
- What's it?

66
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,930
- What?
- Yes.

67
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,860
- Love me.
- Get lost, you jinxed.

68
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,620
Market is open for all. Give it.

69
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,950
- Next time I want full payment...
- Yes, sir.

70
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,780
...if you want the supplies.

71
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,230
Yes, Kale.

72
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,230
Ganu.

73
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,720
What?

74
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,330
Sir, call for you.

75
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,680
Nana sir.

76
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,470
Somebody killed Daya last night.

77
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,160
Even the stuff stored
at his site is missing.

78
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,220
It's a huge loss.

79
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,530
It has to rain to stop the wildfire.

80
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,730
Hey, speak up. What did you see?

81
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,770
Have you seen a ghost?

82
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,200
He's totally in shock.

83
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,790
Rane! Shane!

84
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,490
- What nonsense is going on?
- Sir.

85
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,490
Stop your nonsense. Madam is here.

86
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,680
Madam has come.
Now she will make you spill beans.

87
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,980
You will speak like a parrot now.

88
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,040
Salutation, madam!

89
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,410
Madam, last night
massacre happened here.

90
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,610
Moreover, this was a brutal murder.

91
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,170
It's not a murder.

92
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,010
It's revenge.

93
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,150
Revenge?!

94
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,810
But how?

95
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,730
No rocket science
needs to be applied here.

96
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,140
Look at him carefully.

97
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,980
He has been tortured first.

98
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,770
Isn't killed directly.

99
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,750
Take proper photos, I want close ups.

100
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,840
Yes, madam.

101
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,020
- Gaikwad.
- Yes, madam.

102
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,800
Send the body for postmortem.

103
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,170
Yes, ma'am.

104
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,440
And who's he?

105
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,930
The eyewitness of the massacre.

106
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,620
- He came to meet Daya last night.
- Take him in the custody.

107
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,730
- Hey, come on. Get up.
- Okay, madam.

108
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,770
- No one except me will meet him.
- Yes, madam.

109
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,560
I want proper primary report.

110
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,940
I don't want any carelessness.
Last time you know what had happened.

111
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,160
- Yes, madam...
- Back off, please.

112
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,460
Ma'am, who's responsible
for this massacre?

113
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,540
I will let you know as soon
as I get a full proof report.

114
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,820
And we will talk
to the media once again. Thank you.

115
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,360
Please give us some time.
Please. Thank you.

116
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,790
Ma'am one question, please.

117
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,750
Ma'am, what do you
think about these murders?

118
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,890
But madam, no body was found here.

119
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,730
Something is amiss, Gaikwad.

120
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,890
How was this Daya?

121
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,010
Daya always appeared
descent in the society.

122
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,770
But was into illegal businesses.

123
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,730
Builder by business.

124
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,860
But he used to forcefully
take possessions of lands

125
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,650
construct illegal buildings,
extortion.

126
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,930
These were his main businesses.

127
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,050
No one took action on him?

128
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,250
Nana, madam.

129
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,530
What do you mean?

130
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,370
He was Nana's right hand.

131
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,930
Where's this Nana?

132
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,570
He's in Delhi with minister sir.
Regarding election.

133
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,320
Delhi elections.

134
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,810
So he will come
here for the campaign.

135
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,010
Yes.

136
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,890
So let us start his campaign.

137
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,570
- Right?
- Yes, madam.

138
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,790
- Who's it?
- It's me. Vivek.

139
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,390
It's me, uncle.

140
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,340
I brought this for you, uncle.

141
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,950
How are you feeling now?

142
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,770
No progress.

143
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,810
Uncle, everything will be alright.

144
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,190
Wait for a few more days.

145
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,480
Yes.

146
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,680
'Famous businessman
Daya has been murdered.'

147
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,290
What are they showing
on TV since this morning?

148
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,450
About these murders?

149
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,930
Uncle, even I don't
know anything from this.

150
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,670
I just got to know.

151
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,410
Okay. Shall I take your leave Now?

152
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,610
Are you going?

153
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:49,890
Alright.

154
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,780
Go.

155
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,370
Uncle, have faith in God.

156
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,130
Everything will be fine. I am there.

157
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,520
Who?

158
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,450
Nana sir.

159
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,080
- Sir, investigation is going on.
- Shut up!

160
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,490
I've lost my man.

161
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,690
And you're still investigating?

162
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,690
Don't you love life?

163
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,970
I'm helpless, sir.

164
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,620
New S.P. Kalpana madam
is handling this case.

165
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,360
But why are you there?

166
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,010
- I haven't done anything, sir.
Leave me. - Come on.

167
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,310
Nana, he was near the murder spot.

168
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,970
He's from the opposition party.

169
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,360
Speak up. Who did you give the tip?

170
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,420
I don't know anything,
please leave me.

171
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,870
I will bury Patil tonight.

172
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,910
Ganu, election is coming close.
Take careful steps.

173
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,390
Rizvi had come at night, right?

174
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,070
- To see Daya?
- Yes.

175
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,340
Kale, where's his body?

176
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,750
- He's in SP Kalpana madam's custody.
- Kale.

177
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,550
Nana is the smartest among the lot

178
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,070
and gives a checkmate to his enemy
before he realizes the danger.

179
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,310
24 hours.

180
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,510
Only 24 hours.

181
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,440
[Sulatan Ajam Khan]

182
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,220
'I know you adjust a lot for me.'

183
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,560
'Thank God you realise it.'

184
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,200
"Anybody who crosses my way"

185
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,250
"or messes with me."

186
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,350
"Anybody who crosses my way
or messes with me."

187
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,150
"I swinge him."

188
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,610
"Anybody who crosses my way
or messes with me."

189
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,450
"I swinge him."

190
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,050
"I live in an entirely different
world that is full of friends."

191
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,320
"I'm an ordinary man."

192
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,970
"I've got a good physique."

193
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,800
"At times I'm angry man,
and at times a soft spoken person."

194
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,730
"I am the king of this world."

195
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,850
"Wow, brother."

196
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,470
"Wow, brother Rocky."

197
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,110
"Wow, brother."

198
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,750
"Wow, brother Rocky."

199
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,350
"Wow, brother."

200
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,270
"Wow, brother Rocky."

201
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,700
"Everybody needs a partner in life."

202
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,630
"And I'm always on demand."

203
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,270
"I'm always into
discussions amongst girls."

204
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,620
"Brother Rocky is always trending."

205
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,260
"Everybody needs a partner in life."

206
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,150
"And I'm always on demand."

207
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,910
"I'm always into
discussions amongst girls."

208
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,110
"Brother Rocky is always trending."

209
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,870
"I've got a good physique."

210
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,350
"Even the filmy
heroines are after me."

211
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,650
"I am the king of this world."

212
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,430
"Wow, Rocky."

213
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,240
"Wow, Rocky."

214
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,870
"Wow, brother."

215
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,470
"Wow, brother Rocky."

216
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,070
"Wow, brother."

217
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,750
"Wow, brother Rocky."

218
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,470
"Wow, brother."

219
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,030
"Wow, brother Rocky."

220
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,710
"Wow, brother."

221
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,350
"Wow, brother Rocky."

222
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,990
"Wow, brother."

223
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,470
"Wow, brother Rocky."

224
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,110
"Wow, brother."

225
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,910
"Wow, brother Rocky."

226
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,430
"Wow, brother."

227
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,030
"Wow, brother Rocky."

228
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,710
"Wow, brother."

229
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,470
"Wow, brother Rocky."

230
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,950
"Wow, brother."

231
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,230
"Wow, brother Rocky."

232
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,490
What was the need
to get into the brawl?

233
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,550
Have we taught you this?

234
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,510
Rocky, remember one thing in life.

235
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,280
Not every time,
violence can solve problems.

236
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,510
Think calmly.

237
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:32,310
Mind you, this rage of
yours will ruin you one day.

238
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,310
Why don't you invest your caliber

239
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,470
on your career,
on your work, on your profession?

240
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,040
Show your rage over there.

241
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,230
Who won these medals
and certificates?

242
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,270
Where's that Rocky?

243
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,910
I want that Rocky.

244
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,830
Don't you want to settle in life?

245
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,190
Have you thought over it?

246
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,910
Do you really wish to settle in life?

247
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,230
Do you wish to get married?

248
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,990
Twice, brother.

249
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,940
What?

250
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,390
Two marriages.

251
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,510
Two marriages?

252
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,830
- Yes.
- Why?

253
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,110
Leave that. We are really hungry.

254
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,860
Do you have...

255
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,040
Vidya, will they starve now?

256
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,190
Coming. Piping hot fritters
are ready to serve.

257
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,310
I thought they will be
full after so many rebukes?

258
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,950
Make way.

259
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,280
Take this. You all are hungry, right?

260
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,970
Chiku, you also take it. Take it.

261
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,780
Listen.

262
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,790
Today you were very angry with Rocky.

263
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,900
He has grown up now.

264
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,440
That's why I was angry with him.

265
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,860
I always keep worried about him.

266
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,640
But we need to change
his short tempered nature.

267
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,450
He might land into
some trouble one day.

268
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,640
He should get married
and settle down at this age.

269
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,030
How long he will
enjoy life like this?

270
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,250
And how long will I feed him?

271
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,690
I can understand
your concern about him.

272
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,680
But Rocky is intelligent.
He will settle down.

273
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,430
Don't worry.

274
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,060
Rocky.

275
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,700
Hope brother's rebuke

276
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,470
hasn't hurt you today.

277
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,600
No.

278
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
But he's always right.

279
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,080
Now we must get serious
and settle down in life.

280
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,780
You're right, Rocky.

281
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,760
We do have parents in life.

282
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,290
But not brother like yours.

283
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,220
I really respect him.

284
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:06,570
Today I'm convinced with him.

285
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,200
Brother and sister-in-law
have done a lot for me.

286
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,690
Now, it's time to
return to their favours.

287
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,230
Brother, sister-in-law and Chiku.

288
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,710
I want to make them happy in life.

289
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,880
I will do anything for them.

290
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,510
You just control your anger.

291
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,700
And then you will see
that everything will be fine.

292
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,750
Sure, I will.

293
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,270
Hey, Rocky.

294
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,710
Sister-in-law had made
delicious fritters. Just awesome.

295
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,630
Avi, bring some more for
me if it is still in stock.

296
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,970
I'm very hungry.

297
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,380
Even the biscuits are over.

298
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,800
We are talking something
and you're getting it off track.

299
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,500
Shut up. Hungry cock.

300
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,700
Rocky.

301
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,820
No, enough is enough now.

302
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,740
I must seriously look for a job now.

303
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,900
Now, you just watch.

304
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,760
I will make brother
feel proud about me.

305
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,830
You've received many awards
and certificates in gymnastics.

306
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,460
- Yes.
- That's really very good.

307
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,540
Thank you, sir.

308
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,400
But you're a fresher.

309
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,820
Yes, sir. But if you
hire only experienced people

310
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,200
how will the freshers get
opportunity to show their talents?

311
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,920
Okay.

312
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,040
Hello.

313
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,220
Hi, Sanjana. How are you?

314
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,510
What are you doing?

315
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,520
- Nothing.
- Okay, listen.

316
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,360
Let's meet at your
favourite restaurant today.

317
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,690
Why?

318
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,380
I will tell you once we meet.

319
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,840
Anything special?

320
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,460
Yes, of course.

321
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,780
I will pick you sharp
at 7 pm. near your house.

322
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,860
Okay? Be ready.

323
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,420
Yes, I am always on time.

324
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,220
- And listen.
- What?

325
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,210
- I hate you.
- Rocky...

326
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,670
Grumpy.

327
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,550
Will you speak up now?

328
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,330
Rocky, please tell me. I've
been asking you since a long time.

329
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,820
What's the special occasion today?

330
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,140
- I've got a job.
- Wow!

331
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,600
- React slowly.
- Sorry.

332
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,850
- Rocky. It's great news.
- Yes.

333
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:22,940
I am so happy.

334
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,160
Waiter. One veg pizza,
one Chinese, one noodle

335
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,220
one veg manchow soup.

336
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,650
- And...
- Wait a minute.

337
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,020
I've got a job and not the payment.

338
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,170
Oh really?

339
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,090
Cancel all the orders
and give me a veg pizza.

340
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,230
Okay, madam.

341
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,380
I'm letting you go for now.

342
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,060
But not after you get your salary.

343
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,380
I know you adjust a lot for me.

344
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,140
Thank god you realized.

345
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,250
So then?

346
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,220
Rocky, I'm really very happy today.

347
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,330
Same here.

348
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,180
Now, I want to settle down in life.

349
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:56,160
I want to do a lot for brother,
sister-in-law and Chiku.

350
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,510
Amen.

351
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,660
When will you meet my dad?

352
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,860
I will... give me few months.

353
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,660
Let me settle down in job.
Then I will see him.

354
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,820
Because before meeting
your dad I must be independent.

355
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,220
- That's true.
- Exactly. Anyway.

356
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,730
This is for you.

357
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,390
Special gift.

358
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,020
Wow!

359
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,020
This is so cute!

360
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,260
You like it?

361
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,700
Very pretty. Hope our life
will also be as good as this.

362
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,350
Absolutely.

363
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,300
You were afraid of getting late.

364
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,180
See, you have reached.

365
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,780
Careful.

366
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,180
Now, quickly give me a
hug before somebody notices us.

367
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,100
What's this? What hug?

368
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,620
You daily come to drop me, don't you?

369
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,370
Rocky, I don't want to go home.

370
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:51,100
I just wish that the
time halts when you're with me.

371
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,400
Only both of us.

372
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,020
Anyway, we daily meet.

373
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,380
Yes, we do. I never denied.

374
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,480
But you don't need
to do much for that.

375
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,300
I've to find a new excuse every day.

376
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,220
Every time I deck up to come to you

377
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,520
mom asks me where I am off to.

378
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,150
And I give her excuses
of different friend's birthday.

379
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,500
Thrice in a year I
celebrate Akshay's birthday.

380
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,020
Rocky, I want to proudly
take your name and leave home.

381
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,340
Very freely.

382
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,500
When no one will question me.

383
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,050
When will this happen?

384
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,460
- Just now.
- What?

385
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,810
Let's go.
I will talk to your parents.

386
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,390
Dumbo. I just shared
my feelings with you.

387
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,740
And I also shared my feelings.

388
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,060
Rocky, I think about you only.

389
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,020
Sanjana.

390
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,540
I'm living so as to
fulfill all your dreams.

391
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,080
- Now go, somebody will spot you.
- Bye.

392
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,550
Bye.

393
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,300
Want me to serve you?

394
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,820
Dad, did you watch
the match this morning?

395
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,980
- Dhoni played so well.
- It was first class.

396
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,690
Stop discussing cricket.
Eat first.

397
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,750
Wait. You would always stop us.

398
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,150
- There she is.
- Dad.

399
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,490
Come, my daughter is here.

400
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,640
We started with the supper,
as you didn't come.

401
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,410
What did you bring?

402
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,300
Hey, who gives you such
beautiful gifts every day?

403
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,080
Dad, my friends.
My close friends give it.

404
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,140
- Close friends?
- Yes.

405
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,220
I must meet your close friends once.

406
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,540
Great idea.

407
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,490
Do one thing.
Invite your friends at home.

408
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,900
So that all of us can meet them.

409
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,500
- Yes, Sanjana. Invite them home.
- Yes.

410
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,180
Yes, sure.

411
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,530
I will deal with you later.

412
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,650
Fight later. Take your dinner first.

413
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,260
- Mom, I am not hungry.
- But...

414
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,900
She eats outside food daily.

415
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,630
- It's very unhygienic, you know.
- Yes.

416
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,300
Dad, I will be back in a moment.

417
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,640
- Sanjana.
- Coming.

418
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,330
Sanjana. Hey...

419
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:05,980
She has gone.

420
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,180
You should better get her
married to bring her on track.

421
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,300
Marriage?

422
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,700
She's still very young.

423
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,330
Leave it, dad.
Watch tomorrow's match.

424
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,290
Of course I will watch.

425
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,500
"Sometimes smiling."

426
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,100
"And sometimes upsetting."

427
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:44,950
"Life should be like that."

428
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,300
"Sometimes aloof."

429
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,780
"And sometimes in the crowd."

430
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:59,140
"Life should be one such poem."

431
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,500
"Live a little."

432
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,860
"It's very short."

433
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,300
"Although short, do taste"

434
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,300
"it for its sweetness."

435
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,620
"Sometimes smiling."

436
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,860
"And sometimes upsetting."

437
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:26,200
"Life should be like that."

438
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,460
"Sometimes her excuses."

439
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,980
"Kind of silly as
well as intelligent."

440
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:54,790
"Life is somewhat like her."

441
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,160
"Some crazy people."

442
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,710
"Sing in love."

443
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:08,920
"And then the life
seems to be a fairytale."

444
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:15,800
"Sometimes happiness
and sometimes pain."

445
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:22,260
"But you keep moving, O heart."

446
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,580
"Sometimes smiling."

447
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,780
"And sometimes upsetting."

448
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:35,660
"Life should be like that."

449
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,300
"Sometimes aloof."

450
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,460
"And sometimes in the crowd."

451
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:49,010
"Life should be one such poem."

452
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,780
I can't believe.
How can you do this?

453
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,100
You know what?
Dad will be left in a shock

454
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,050
to know about your love affair.

455
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:08,210
Rocky, I am against this marriage.

456
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,100
And Sanjana,
you will not meet Rocky now.

457
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,790
And you also will
not meet Sanjana, Rocky.

458
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,540
- Listen to me, brother.
- Sanjana.

459
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,220
Rahul! I love Sanjana.

460
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,640
I can't live without her.
You please tell him, Sanjana.

461
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,750
Rocky!

462
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,720
Rocky.

463
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,920
You forget me and our love.

464
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,220
Sorry. Listen, it was her plan.

465
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,420
Rocky, both of you are in love.

466
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,580
And both of you will involve
your parents in your marriage.

467
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,100
Then why would I object?

468
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,740
I'd love to make you
a part of our family.

469
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,460
Even my parents had
gone for love marriage.

470
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,100
- Really?
- Yes.

471
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,760
Do this,
come home day after tomorrow.

472
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,350
Dad will be back home by then.

473
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,100
Keep this a surprise for him as well.

474
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,330
Okay, I will take your leave.
Nana sir told me

475
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,050
to distribute bonus in the company.

476
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,700
You're lucky, Rahul.

477
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,490
You're working in Nana sir's company.

478
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,620
Rocky, you too are lucky.

479
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,300
Sanjana is with you.

480
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,090
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

481
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,270
Take care.

482
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,800
Bye. Reach home early
in the evening.

483
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,060
- Yes.
- Bye.

484
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,930
Sorry. Sorry.

485
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,100
Sanjana.

486
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,620
So, you were scared.

487
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,500
You think only you can scare me?

488
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,610
I am also not any less.

489
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,830
Yes, madam. You're great.

490
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:42,940
Correct.

491
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,500
You will behave like this
even after marriage, okay?

492
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,820
- Really?
- Yes.

493
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,980
Sanjana, I've got a job now.

494
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,700
Very soon we will get married.

495
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,320
Now, our dreams
are getting fulfilled.

496
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,430
Life seems so beautiful.

497
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,450
Rocky, we will live happily.

498
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,960
Brother, sister-in-law, you and me.

499
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,550
We will live together.

500
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,590
I like the joint families.

501
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,660
And how can I forget
something really important?

502
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,570
Our bedroom. I will decorate it.

503
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,090
I will paint it pink. Very beautiful.

504
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:16,170
And I will decorate the entire house.

505
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:24,880
1... 2... 3... 4... 5...

506
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,460
Come on. 6...

507
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:32,340
7... 8... 9... 10

508
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,240
Take your call.
It's ringing continuously.

509
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,830
- No, sir.
- Take it. Take your call.

510
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,130
Okay, sir. Thank you.

511
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,360
- Hello.
- Yes, tell me.

512
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,230
- What are you doing?
- Sleeping.

513
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,510
What? Sleeping in gym?

514
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,070
People work over there.
They don't sleep.

515
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,420
Sanjana, I am busy.
Can we talk later?

516
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,220
Please, talk to me for some time.

517
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,580
I can't.

518
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,640
- I am missing you, Rocky.
- So, how can I help?

519
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,780
Come on.

520
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,180
Leave it. Brother and I have
come to your favourite restaurant.

521
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,180
You also come for the lunch.

522
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,140
Sanjana, I can't come. I am busy.

523
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,220
Do you get it?

524
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,620
Why are you getting angry?

525
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,020
No, I am not.

526
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,720
Why are you shouting on me?

527
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,900
I am not shouting.

528
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,530
Rocky, why are you yelling?

529
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,430
I am not yelling.

530
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,590
I don't want to talk to you.
I won't talk to you at all.

531
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,460
Even if you call me up
I will not talk to you. Bye.

532
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,890
What's wrong, sir?

533
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,070
With my training your
body might look like Arnold.

534
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,320
But these girls are impossible.

535
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,820
- My body, sir?
- Yes. I will make train your body.

536
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:37,860
Yes.

537
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,790
What's it? Why are you
shouting on that poor fellow?

538
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,720
- He's on duty, right?
- Poor?

539
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,320
He's not poor, brother.

540
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,810
Besides, I enjoy troubling him.

541
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,200
Let's go to the office.

542
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,480
I've some work.
And from there we will go home.

543
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,730
- Home?
- Yes.

544
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,720
Brother, you had promised
to buy me a dress.

545
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,100
You had promised me.

546
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,760
- Do you still remember?
- Yes.

547
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,470
- Okay, let's go.
- Yes.

548
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,840
Sanjana, please pick up the phone.

549
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,790
God!

550
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,680
Sanjana!

551
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,500
Rahul. Rahul.

552
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,120
Rahul. What happened?

553
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:13,950
Rahul.

554
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,560
Rahul.

555
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,990
Hey, what are you doing? Who are you?

556
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,160
Mom. Mom.

557
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,570
- Mom.
- Sanjana.

558
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,710
Mom.

559
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,480
Yes, Mohite.

560
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,810
There's a problem.

561
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,140
- What has happened, mom?
- Please save Sanjana.

562
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,690
Ro... Rocky.

563
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,440
Sanjana.

564
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,840
Sanjana.

565
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,150
Nothing will happen to you, Sanjana.

566
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,040
Sanjana.

567
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,800
Sanjana.

568
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,220
Na... Na...

569
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,230
Sanjana.

570
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,200
Sanjana.

571
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,170
Sanjana.

572
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,010
Sanjana, wake up.

573
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,030
Sanjana, talk to me.

574
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,920
I will do as you say.
Sanjana, wake up.

575
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,570
- Talk to me. Sanjana.
- Leave her, let's go.

576
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,860
Leave me. Sanjana.

577
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,470
I can't live without you.

578
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,790
Talk to me.

579
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,330
Sanjana.

580
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:29,980
Come on.

581
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,210
Sanjana. Talk to me.

582
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,300
Come on.

583
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,260
How dare you rape a girl?!

584
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,520
And raise hand at a police officer?

585
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,250
Come, I will show you.

586
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,730
Listen to me, brother.

587
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:52,660
- Brother. Brother, hello.
- What's it? What do you want?

588
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,110
- Just leave.
- Just a minute.

589
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,770
Let me meet him once.

590
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,960
Who are you? Who do you want to meet?

591
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,480
- Rocky.
- You can't meet him.

592
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,530
- But why?
- Why?

593
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,740
Theft, murder,
rape and raising hands at police.

594
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,000
These are the serious
charges leveled on him.

595
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,980
No, sir.

596
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,640
Kale sir has given
clear instructions.

597
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,890
No one will meet him. Go.

598
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,610
Listen, Rocky is
not that type of a boy.

599
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,770
- Hey...
- Just a minute.

600
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:22,210
Kale sir is checking how he is.
Is that clear?

601
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,110
Yes, sir. Don't get angry.

602
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,560
Just two days.

603
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,010
Saturday and Sunday.

604
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,970
Kale sir will make him spill beans.
Is that clear?

605
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,050
Now get going.

606
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,940
Sign.

607
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Sign.

608
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,610
- Yes, brother Daya.
- Yes, Kale.

609
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,520
He's not ready to confess the crime.

610
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:13,140
Kale, you're useless.
You can't do anything.

611
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,790
- Come on. Let's go.
- Yes.

612
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,530
Kale, take it patiently.
Why do you do this?

613
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:39,680
Come on.

614
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,010
Brother Daya. Brother Daya.

615
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,740
- You rogue.
- Stop.

616
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,210
Daya.

617
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,820
I will break you into pieces.

618
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,640
Not only yours.

619
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,490
You've a brother, right?

620
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,620
A sister-in-law and a niece.
What's her name?

621
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,020
- Chiku.
- Chiku.

622
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,970
I will slit throats.

623
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,070
Of all of them.

624
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,160
Then I will kill you.

625
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,690
- Sign.
- Brother Daya.

626
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,030
- Calm down.
- Will you not?

627
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,060
You calm down. I will talk to him.

628
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:16,640
Hey, he's mad. He knows everything.

629
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,350
Don't take the sin of
slaying those three lives.

630
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,830
- Sign.
- Wait.

631
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,760
I promise.
Nothing will happen to them.

632
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,150
And nothing will
happen to you as well.

633
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,900
Get up. Come on, sign now.

634
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,440
He is doing it.

635
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,310
- Give him a pen.
- Here.

636
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,830
- Yes. - No need of a pen.
Take thumb impression.

637
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,440
Here it is. Come on. Put it here.

638
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,410
- Yes.
- Very good.

639
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,390
This is the first time
I've seen such a case.

640
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,080
Boyfriend is imprisoned
for raping his girlfriend.

641
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,830
Kale.

642
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,460
Rakesh Pawar alias Rocky

643
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,140
is given lifetime imprisonment.

644
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,090
What do we do, sir?

645
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,940
I can't do anything now.

646
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,080
Your brother has confessed the crime.

647
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,020
How can I help?

648
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,580
Yes, we agree. We don't deny.

649
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,750
But he's innocent.

650
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,580
Innocent? Then go to the high court.

651
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,700
We are not that capable.
Why don't you understand?

652
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,100
Then do this.
Forgive me. Just leave now.

653
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,630
Take it for the sake of humanity.
Rocky can't do this.

654
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,460
- I did all this for humanity?
- He must have been forced to do this.

655
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,600
- He has confessed his crime.
- Brother Rocky.

656
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,470
Rocky!

657
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,190
Stop sir.
Let me meet him for just 2 minutes.

658
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,410
- Rocky.
- Dad, where's uncle going?

659
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,600
- My dear...
- Why isn't he coming home?

660
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,380
- He will...
- Where's police taking him?

661
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,950
Uncle. Don't go.

662
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:05,960
Uncle. Let's go home.

663
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,880
- Why isn't uncle coming home?
- Go inside.

664
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,940
I got piping hot breakfast.

665
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,370
Thank you very much.

666
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,680
- Go and serve now.
- Right away.

667
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,410
Rocky.

668
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,980
Didn't you sleep at night?

669
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,060
He had turned on the TV and slept.

670
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:26,820
Pakya's call?

671
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,330
Yes, Pakya, what's it?

672
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:29,830
What is the tip?

673
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,280
Color it till the top.

674
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,260
No part should be left.
From top to bottom

675
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,060
Don't do unnecessary time pass here.

676
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,770
I should not be able to see
any part left from top to bottom.

677
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,960
Understood.

678
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,590
The entire work should be done properly

679
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,480
No stain should be visible here.

680
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,540
We have already discussed
about the budget.

681
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,600
After the work finished
don't saythat you want more money.

682
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:54,820
Hey, get going.

683
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,940
Idiots.

684
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,620
What are you looking at?

685
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,100
He's so handsome.
Look at his muscles.

686
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,940
Whose? Mine?

687
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,720
Get lost.

688
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,010
Rocky, come inside.

689
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,840
You handle everything over there.

690
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,380
I will handle it here.

691
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,460
Are you alright?

692
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,710
Okay, disconnect the call.

693
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,550
How's everyone at home?

694
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,440
Brother, sister-in-law. Chiku?

695
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,680
They are good.

696
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,500
Rocky. There's a problem.

697
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,100
- What?
- Daya murder case is on hype now.

698
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,340
And those girls?

699
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,940
Don't worry about them.
They have reached home safe.

700
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:53,020
Once I make a commitment
I don't even listen to my mom.

701
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:57,080
But you've created a mess outside.

702
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,520
You murdered Daya but
left one man alive over there.

703
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,440
Do you remember?

704
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,420
Now Nana is after him.

705
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,290
Kale is already his ally.

706
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:09,430
He will kill him in the lock up only.

707
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,760
Before that Kale will be dead.

708
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,780
But...

709
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,980
Just yesterday you killed Daya.
And now Kale?

710
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,150
Don't you think we are hurrying up?

711
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,940
We have already delayed a lot.

712
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,900
I've been waiting from past 3 years.

713
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,480
Jaggu.

714
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:25,890
Kale.

715
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,050
Done.

716
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,300
"This silvery beauty."

717
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,420
"And curvy body."

718
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,340
"This silvery beauty."

719
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,900
"And curvy body."

720
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,700
"Eyes, as sharp as a gun."

721
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:14,740
"That kill people at a glance."

722
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:21,080
"People get crazy for
me and spend nights here."

723
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:28,300
"Intoxicated by my eyes,
they start speaking in English."

724
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:33,100
"This attitude of mine is unmatched."

725
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,860
"I'm little local and little English."

726
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:43,540
"This attitude of mine is unmatched."

727
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:48,010
"I'm little local and little English."

728
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:10,460
"Looking at my curves, hearts races."

729
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,660
"He replaces my figure in his heart."

730
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,780
"Sometimes I am spicy
and sometimes sour."

731
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,170
"Sometimes sweet as well."

732
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,060
"People come in suit and boot."

733
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,820
"And feel shy on seeing my smile."

734
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,540
"They get fever of getting me."

735
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:34,020
"And start dreaming about me."

736
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,530
"This attitude of mine is unmatched."

737
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:44,980
"I'm little local and little English."

738
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:49,140
"This attitude of mine is unmatched."

739
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:54,580
"I'm little local and little English."

740
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,130
Damn! Even this has finished.

741
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,980
- Hey...
- Yes.

742
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,640
Come here.

743
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,780
- Yes, sir.
- Go get two bottles quickly. Go.

744
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:19,860
Sir, we are closed now.

745
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,030
What?

746
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,900
Sir, we are closed now.

747
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,420
Hey, idiot.

748
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,170
You know who I am, don't you?

749
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,260
- Yes.
- Go.

750
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,840
Idiot.

751
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,170
These people will never reform.

752
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,900
"I'm little local..."

753
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,300
Very good.

754
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,500
Wow!

755
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,860
How's it, sir?

756
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,700
- First class.
- It has to be.

757
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,010
- It's of the first lot.
- You bloody...

758
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,220
You?!

759
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,800
Finish him.

760
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,940
'Boy friend is imprisoned
for raping his girlfriend.'

761
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,080
Madam. Hey, madam.

762
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,920
What do you do here?

763
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:52,140
I work here.

764
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,780
What do you work at night?
Do let us know.

765
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,610
What are you saying?

766
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,370
What do you mean?
A murder took place here.

767
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,060
We will inquire.
We are police officers.

768
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,690
- We've the right to ask. Right, Rane?
- Yes.

769
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,130
- Rane! Shane!
- Sir.

770
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:07,130
Sir.

771
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,290
- What's going on?
- Sir.

772
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,420
What's it?

773
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,450
Eyewitness.

774
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:20,730
Madam, don't be afraid.
Tell the truth about what you saw.

775
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,160
Yes, sir.

776
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,710
- Take her to the police station.
- Yes, sir.

777
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,210
Explain the sketch artist.

778
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,140
Yes, sir.

779
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:30,530
Let's go home, madam.

780
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,970
- Rane.
- Sorry, sir.

781
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,130
- Sawant madam.
- Yes, sir.

782
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,690
- Take her with you.
- Let's go.

783
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,800
What?

784
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,920
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

785
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,480
It was him.

786
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:55,090
- Rizvi. Do you also agree with this?
- Yes, he's the same guy.

787
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,410
- Joshi.
- Yes.

788
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,210
- Are the sketches ready?
- Yes, sir.

789
00:51:58,850 --> 00:51:59,910
This is Kale's murderer.

790
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:01,690
And this is of Daya.

791
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,490
Exactly ma'am.
I too had the same doubt.

792
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:09,310
Ma'am, Daya works for Nana.

793
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,170
And Kale as well.

794
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,170
So, this link will take us to Nana.

795
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,370
- We must meet Nana.
- Yes, ma'am.

796
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,410
- But before that look for him.
- Sure.

797
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,050
Direct attack on our gang?

798
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,640
And loss in business.

799
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:35,850
Who could dare do this?

800
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:38,880
Nana sir.

801
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,370
Do something.

802
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:49,210
Ganu, I won't get scared
with the death of one or two pawns.

803
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,730
Nana is a king.

804
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:57,570
He checkmates his enemy
before he realizes danger.

805
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,890
Police has prepared Rocky's sketch.

806
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,890
Rocky say something, please.

807
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,250
- What do we do next?
- Yes.

808
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,770
Jaggu, get up. Tell him something.

809
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:12,650
Rocky, what's your next plan?

810
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:19,370
Ganu.

811
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,130
Done.

812
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,230
But...

813
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,180
- Gaikwad, is this the correct address?
- Yes, madam.

814
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,460
Rocky's brother and
sister-in-law live here.

815
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:46,710
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

816
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:48,580
- Do you have fire?
- What do you mean?

817
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,950
I mean matchstick.

818
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:53,090
Get going.

819
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,330
- Sir, tell me one thing.
- What?

820
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:58,700
Is she your new madam?

821
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,340
Ajay Pawar?

822
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:04,980
Yes, that's me.

823
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,750
Take it, sir.

824
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,940
- Thank you.
- Madam.

825
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,430
Where's Rocky?

826
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,380
Don't you know, sir?

827
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,860
Rocky is in jail
from past three years.

828
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:34,620
Are you sure you don't know anything?

829
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,140
No, sir. But why?
Why do you ask me this?

830
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,580
What happened to Rocky?

831
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:43,300
He absconded three days ago
while shifting him to the other jail.

832
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,940
No, sir. Trust me.
I don't know anything about this.

833
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,620
But where is he now?

834
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:54,680
Alright.

835
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:58,240
We are just informing you.
He has committed more murders.

836
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,660
- Rocky committed murders?
- Don't talk nonsense.

837
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,500
- Don't accuse him like this.
- Vidya.

838
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,550
It's impossible for Rocky
to do anything like this.

839
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:08,400
I've raised him like my son.

840
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,870
- He can't do anything like this.
- Vidya.

841
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:12,500
- Vidya.
- You too are like those officers.

842
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,320
- They too had done the same.
- Yes, Vidya.

843
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,340
- They booked him under false charges.
- Vidya.

844
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,540
All of you've framed Rocky.

845
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,780
- You people have framed him.
- Vidya.

846
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,240
- Listen to them.
- Go inside. I will talk to them.

847
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,270
Sorry, madam.

848
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,010
I am sorry.

849
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,100
I can understand her emotions.

850
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:40,670
We are here to help you.

851
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,530
We only expect your cooperation.

852
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:48,370
Madam, I am ready to
do anything for my Rocky.

853
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:50,190
Good.

854
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,580
I will change his prescription.
Bring those.

855
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,940
We will try for speedy recovery.

856
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,550
I also expect the same.

857
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,900
Uncle, I will drop him.

858
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,480
And bring the medicine on way back.

859
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,850
Okay. Go.

860
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,010
Rocky.

861
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:36,990
Don't send me to your home again.

862
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,700
Police is keeping
watch on your house.

863
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:43,260
Is brother alright?

864
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,900
Yes. He's good.

865
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:53,200
Sorry. I've brought the things
you had asked for.

866
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:55,660
Check it.
Meanwhile, I will go and get fresh.

867
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:48,580
"The time is smooth and nice."

868
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:53,620
"My speechless heart is calling you."

869
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,100
"The time is smooth and nice."

870
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,260
"My speechless heart is calling you."

871
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:08,340
"The desire of my heart has awakened."

872
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:13,020
"I am teasing you by my touch."

873
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,820
"Listen to my heart, beloved."

874
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:22,340
"Listen to my heart, beloved."

875
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,620
"Listen to my heart, beloved."

876
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:32,340
"Listen to my heart, beloved."

877
00:58:54,600 --> 00:59:01,300
"All directions have become unstabel."

878
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:08,490
"You're my moon and my night."

879
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:14,180
"I feel lonely without you.
Do not refuse me."

880
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:18,780
"Why should I be afraid of the world
when my heart has chosen you."

881
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:23,780
"The breeze that blows says it
this every moment."

882
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,460
"Do not go away, my beloved."

883
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:33,100
"Listen to my heart, beloved."

884
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:37,740
"Listen to my heart, beloved."

885
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:43,660
"Listen to my heart, beloved."

886
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:16,720
"Wonder what intoxication is this!"

887
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:24,220
"Stop me otherwise
I would make some mistake."

888
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:29,550
"I will be restless without you.
I don't know what will happen of me."

889
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:34,330
"The desire of my heart yearns for you."

890
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,750
"I am adorned for you."

891
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:39,210
"I am standing ready for you."

892
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:43,910
"Listen to what my heart said."

893
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:48,790
"Listen to my heart, beloved."

894
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:53,510
"Listen to my heart, beloved."

895
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:58,150
"Listen to my heart, beloved."

896
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:02,910
"Listen to my heart, beloved."

897
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:07,930
"Listen to my heart, beloved."

898
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:12,950
"Listen to my heart, beloved."

899
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:25,180
Are all the documents proper?

900
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:26,370
Sir, your signatures are needed on this.

901
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:27,540
Check properly.

902
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,390
And tell me if my
signatures are needed.

903
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:32,390
Okay.

904
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,280
- Salutations, sir.
- Greetings.

905
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:35,610
Please sit.

906
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:39,590
- Sir, actually...
- Ganu.

907
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,210
Order a cup of strong coffee.

908
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:42,570
Kadam.

909
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,160
Sir, actually, you see...

910
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,260
Wait a minute.
And one teaspoon sugar.

911
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,410
One teaspoon.

912
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:51,130
Go on.

913
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:53,250
May I, sir?

914
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:58,890
- Sir, actually... two murd...
- Sorry, please take tea.

915
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:01,330
No, sir.

916
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,100
- Do you want?
- No, madam.

917
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,330
We don't want it, sir.

918
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:11,490
Sir, out of the two murders,
one was Daya.

919
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,050
He was a builder.

920
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,300
Who? Who's this Daya?

921
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:18,850
You know him well, sir.

922
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:21,460
I don't know. I don't know him.

923
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:26,450
I see. Okay, sir.

924
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:30,530
The second murder
was of inspector Kale.

925
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,570
One from your known circles.

926
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:36,650
I don't know, madam.

927
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,800
I meet countless people in a day.

928
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,490
I help them.

929
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,800
I can't remember all of them.

930
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:45,860
It's impossible.

931
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,470
You're right.

932
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:53,130
But these murders links end at you.

933
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,920
That's why I feel you should
increase police protection.

934
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,140
What's this, madam?

935
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:01,710
- What was that police officer's name?
- Kale.

936
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:02,700
Yes, Kale.

937
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:07,810
You couldn't protect him.

938
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:10,020
This is too much, madam.

939
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:13,740
- Tell him.
- No, sir...

940
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:14,730
I will take your leave.

941
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:15,980
Yes, Patil.

942
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,220
Yes, preparing for the election. Yes.

943
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,050
- Do you see these men?
- See you soon.

944
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,020
They are our protection.

945
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,580
Tell us if you need protection.

946
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:31,260
I will send it on discounted rates.

947
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,020
Will you speak to
that empty sofa now?

948
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:40,540
Just leave.
Why being so buttery? Leave.

949
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:42,860
Madam.

950
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:09,780
- Where are you?
- Here at the gate.

951
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,210
Okay. What about the police?

952
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:14,710
- They are on night duty, sleeping.
- Sure?

953
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:16,050
- Yes.
- How do we go?

954
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:19,300
Don't worry.
I've arranged for a scooty.

955
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:21,470
Okay, drive.
- Let's go.

956
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:38,870
What should we do now, buddy?

957
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,540
Go. Go inside.

958
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,310
What about the police
siren we heard just now?

959
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:53,780
That's not for us.

960
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,860
It's for the domestic
violence in the ground floor.

961
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:56,860
It's their routine now.

962
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,110
You don't worry about them.

963
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:00,380
- Please come.
- Come, brother.

964
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:03,810
We will go downstairs
and check. Okay?

965
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:05,200
- Come fast.
- Yes. Let's go.

966
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,250
You all are coward.

967
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:08,980
- Who had called up?
- I had called up.

968
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,450
He doubts me.

969
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:11,060
- What?
- No.

970
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,610
Please save me from him.

971
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,790
He says that I fall
in love with youngsters.

972
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:15,900
I will lock you behind bars.

973
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,740
You tell me, do I look like that?

974
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:19,060
No. Never.

975
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,850
He doubts me.

976
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:24,210
If I come close to you,
he will doubt me.

977
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:26,770
If I will hold your hand,
he will doubt.

978
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:29,980
And if I give you a kiss,
he will doubt.

979
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,940
You tell me. Do I look like that?

980
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:37,340
Your wife is so cultured,
loving and good.

981
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,230
She's so good.

982
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:42,000
- Rane, your wife has come.
- Where?

983
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,400
- Where?
- You're scared, right?

984
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:45,940
Scared.

985
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:50,600
If you go near her
again and touch her

986
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:54,420
I will complaint your wife.

987
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:56,140
Sir.

988
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:57,440
Hand...

989
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:01,270
Hey, don't touch her again.

990
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:02,940
Don't touch her.

991
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:05,240
- Let's go.
- Leave it.

992
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,060
Now, I won't doubt you.

993
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:35,710
Come on, eat all of you.

994
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:41,320
Today police visited us.

995
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,460
They were enquiring about you.

996
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:48,340
They have two witnesses
and they have identified you.

997
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:49,900
SP Kalpana madam.

998
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:53,530
I think she's very honest and sharp.

999
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,540
All of you, take care.

1000
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,100
You can't trust her.

1001
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,380
She might...

1002
01:07:07,710 --> 01:07:10,580
All of you eat. I will go, get fresh.

1003
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:39,180
Brother.

1004
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:56,380
Brother, I had read in
your eyes what you wanted to say.

1005
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,320
Rocky, Vidya had
told me about Sanjana.

1006
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,780
But it was too late by then.

1007
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:11,100
I went to her house frequently
in past three years.

1008
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,620
But I couldn't meet anyone.

1009
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,540
The day life imprisonment
was announced on you

1010
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,000
they just disappeared.

1011
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:26,870
I tried my best to find them

1012
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,740
but couldn't get any clue about them.

1013
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:34,580
Brother.

1014
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:37,700
I am tired now.

1015
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:42,660
I don't understand

1016
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:45,770
if I am doing right or wrong.

1017
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:51,050
I tell you one thing, Rocky.

1018
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:54,570
The day you see anger in my eyes

1019
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:58,860
that day you will be wrong.

1020
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:04,620
Brother.

1021
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:07,260
I am very tired.

1022
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:19,060
Brothers.

1023
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:20,540
Be careful.

1024
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,220
I am okay.

1025
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:24,830
Rupesh.

1026
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,380
Brother Ajay just visited you all.

1027
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:30,260
He loves you all so much.

1028
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:33,420
I am so touched.

1029
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:41,140
I've only one elder brother. Sultan.

1030
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,340
Brother Sultan.

1031
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:46,980
Jaggya.

1032
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:51,300
You always talk about brother Sultan.

1033
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:54,710
Tell us what happened in the jail.

1034
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:58,060
I will tell you.

1035
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:03,650
Like the people living on rent

1036
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,860
I was living in jail.

1037
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:10,340
They used to transfer me in
different jail after every 11 months.

1038
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:17,650
Fortunately, rocky and I
were transferred in the same jail.

1039
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:18,600
Sir...

1040
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,410
Sir, what are you thinking?

1041
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:26,220
When I learned his matter,
I lost my temper.

1042
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:30,500
I tell you. I was looking
for a chance to kill him.

1043
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,040
Sorry.

1044
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:37,470
Every time,
everywhere I used to cross his ways.

1045
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:42,100
But he wasn't losing his temper.

1046
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:47,630
Don't take tension.
I will handle everything.

1047
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:51,220
One day I got that chance.

1048
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,180
What's wrong with you, uncle Rahim?

1049
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,280
Are you not alright?

1050
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:02,980
I've taken insulin. I am very hungry.

1051
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,940
- So, eat.
- No.

1052
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,820
No one can eat until
Sultan doesn't arrive.

1053
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,420
How can they do this?

1054
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,660
Wait, I will bring it for you.

1055
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:12,770
No, stop. Stop.

1056
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:22,750
Hey, you're being too smart.

1057
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,700
Will you take lunch before Sultan?

1058
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,660
Are they all mad to wait here?

1059
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:29,070
Leave my hand.

1060
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:31,840
I won't...

1061
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,060
Leave my hand.

1062
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:35,460
Here you go.

1063
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:48,900
Stop. Just stay here.

1064
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:51,120
I will break your bones right here.

1065
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,020
Stay here, you bloody idiot.

1066
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:57,990
'God is great.'

1067
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:59,340
Brother Sultan.

1068
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,300
Brother Sultan. I was...

1069
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:04,830
'God is great.'

1070
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:41,680
Brother Sultan,
that idiot raised his hand on me.

1071
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:24,000
Brother Sultan. He... he's
the one who raised hands on your men.

1072
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,150
He raised his hand on your Jaggu.

1073
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:28,240
I want his bones to be broken.

1074
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,840
Sultan. He was taking lunch for me.

1075
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:39,640
- Eat.
- Thanks, son.

1076
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:53,840
Brother Sultan, jailor has called you.

1077
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,020
His name is Rocky.

1078
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:13,420
He's not as calm as he is seen.

1079
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:17,700
But I can't dare tell him the truth.

1080
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:19,780
Both of us have the same enemy.

1081
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,470
But we need to make him speak.

1082
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:25,540
Now, it's your call.

1083
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,220
He has been shifted here for this.

1084
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:38,060
Move aside.

1085
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,240
Get out from here. Move.

1086
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:44,880
Come on. Move. Go from here.

1087
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:49,520
Jailor told me everything about you.

1088
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,140
But I follow a principle.

1089
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:55,510
I don't believe until I don't
listen to the truth from the person.

1090
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:59,500
Our enemy is the same. Nana.

1091
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,100
Tell me what had happened.

1092
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:06,080
Trust me.
Sultan will never ditch you.

1093
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,990
Oh my God, brother.
The office is so cool.

1094
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:20,620
Yes. And look there.
That's my cabin.

1095
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,860
Very nice.
Brother, washroom.

1096
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:25,440
It's there.
Go upstairs and on your right.

1097
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,490
- Okay.
- I will be in my cabin. Come there.

1098
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:28,470
Yes.

1099
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:30,580
Where are the files now?

1100
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:05,910
Sanjana!

1101
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:10,020
- What's wrong?
- Brother, you look at it. Look at it.

1102
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:14,260
Come here.

1103
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:16,940
Hey, check if everything is proper.

1104
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:20,660
Yes, it is.

1105
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:23,180
Listen, call up Ganu.
- Tell me.

1106
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:24,740
And tell him to shift them from here.

1107
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:27,580
Why this transport
had to strike today?

1108
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:30,330
Exactly. But Ganu sir is nice.

1109
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:31,340
He handles everything.

1110
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,250
Otherwise, Daya sir and
Nana sir would have punished us.

1111
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:36,220
Wonder when this
strike will get over

1112
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,430
and wonder when we
will take them out from here?

1113
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,560
Yes, wait. I will call up Ganu sir.

1114
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,580
- I will tell him everything. Let's go.
- Okay.

1115
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:18,610
Thank you very much
for your cooperation.

1116
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:23,910
Give your address and phone
number before leaving from here.

1117
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:27,050
In case, if I've to enquire more,
I need it.

1118
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:28,400
- Right?
- Sure.

1119
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,480
Yes, okay, thank you.

1120
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:30,930
- Mohite.
- Name, Rahul Deshmukh.

1121
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,820
Brother. I will just come.
It's dad's phone.

1122
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:35,360
Okay. Sector 16, bungalow number 32.

1123
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,080
Why did you go there?

1124
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,600
You should have left from there.

1125
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:40,470
What if something
had happened to you?

1126
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,800
Mom, brother was with me.

1127
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:45,550
You people will not believe me.

1128
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:47,380
Come on, get ready.
Rocky is coming today, right?

1129
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:50,370
Yes. I forgot.

1130
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,700
I am thinking of
not inviting him today.

1131
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,870
So much has happened
that I am in off mood now.

1132
01:17:57,950 --> 01:18:01,780
Listen, Rocky is waiting to
see your dad from past five years.

1133
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:03,520
You've planned this surprise
for your dad, right?

1134
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,000
So, go and get ready.

1135
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,800
Listen, Sanjana. Our day is spoiled.

1136
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,360
Let's not spoil it for him.
Let him come.

1137
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,280
- Sanjana.
- I don't understand what to do.

1138
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:15,080
But since you both
are insisting let him come.

1139
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:18,280
Once Rocky comes here,
your mood will change.

1140
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,320
Now go. Get fresh. Get ready.

1141
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:22,400
I will take care of the dinner.

1142
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,250
- Hey, sir, you?!
- Hello.

1143
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,180
Please, come in.

1144
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,240
- I hope I haven't disturbed you.
- Not at all. Please, come in.

1145
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:36,560
Actually, I wanted some
more details that's why I came.

1146
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:37,560
- Okay.
- Rahul.

1147
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:38,640
- Who's he?
- Hello.

1148
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,640
- Hello.
- She's my mom.

1149
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:41,510
- Okay.
- He's Mr. Kale.

1150
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:43,120
I told you about him some time ago.

1151
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,520
What will you take?
Tea or coffee?

1152
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,960
- Tea will do.
- I will get it right away.

1153
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,640
Enough milk and less sugar.

1154
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,780
We, the police can't do without it.

1155
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:51,770
Yes.

1156
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:53,600
- Come, sir.
- Yes.

1157
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:57,880
Please, sit.

1158
01:18:59,070 --> 01:18:59,740
Wow!

1159
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,080
Tell me, sir.

1160
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:04,120
It's so nice.

1161
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,640
My god!

1162
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:09,090
Chandelier in Marathi's house?

1163
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:11,840
Actually,
this is our ancestral house.

1164
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,200
Then my dad retired.

1165
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,880
And we renovated it
from dad's retirement fund.

1166
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:18,880
What was your dad's job?

1167
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:21,680
- He was a professor.
- Okay.

1168
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,000
Okay, tell me one thing, Rahul.

1169
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:28,480
- Your boss Nana sir.
- Yes.

1170
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,100
Had he been involved in this case

1171
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:34,160
then what would
have been your stand?

1172
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:39,920
Even if Nana sir is involved,
I will not step back.

1173
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,840
Correct. Very good.

1174
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:45,880
Law is above all.

1175
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,120
Exactly my opinion.

1176
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,270
Criminal must be punished.

1177
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:51,320
Yes, the criminal will be punished.

1178
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,280
- It's true.
- Hey.

1179
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,480
I will just come.

1180
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,150
Will you speak against Nana?

1181
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,510
Rahul!

1182
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,150
Brother!

1183
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:23,600
Mom.

1184
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:26,010
What have you done?

1185
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:30,330
What have you done?

1186
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:35,280
Leave. Leave me.

1187
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:37,620
Nana sir will have a good time.
- Leave me.

1188
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,780
For the first time my eyes
have shed tears for others.

1189
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:06,040
I will not let it get waste.

1190
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,220
I lost my wife because of Nana.

1191
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:17,910
All my men ditched me.

1192
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:20,220
Nana has framed me here.

1193
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:27,380
Nana is your enemy as well as mine.

1194
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:30,400
You want to seek revenge, right?

1195
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,100
Will you?

1196
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:35,550
Do you have the courage?

1197
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:37,500
You prepare from your end.

1198
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,060
I will do all the
arrangements for you in jail.

1199
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,060
- Jaggu.
- Yes, brother Sultan.

1200
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:49,050
- Start making arrangements.
- Okay.

1201
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:52,520
Police Gymnasium

1202
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,700
"Let the blood boil now."

1203
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:14,660
"Till when will there be darkness?"

1204
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:19,060
"Get ready to win alone."

1205
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:23,540
"Conquer all the odds."

1206
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:32,820
"Let the blood boil now."

1207
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:37,340
"Till when will there be darkness?"

1208
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,940
"Get ready to win alone."

1209
01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:46,560
"Conquer all the odds."

1210
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:51,460
"Do whatever you have suffered."

1211
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:55,900
"Keep instigating me.
I should not get calm."

1212
01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:01,180
"Come and promise yourself.
I may die but will not stop."

1213
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,460
"My eyes are thirsty for blood."

1214
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:06,220
"Come on do it and win."

1215
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:08,060
"Make a firm promise to yourself."

1216
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:11,370
"Fight..."

1217
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:15,860
"Fight..."

1218
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:21,660
"Revenge runs through my blood."

1219
01:23:21,950 --> 01:23:26,820
Come and play...

1220
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,030
Brother Daya.

1221
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:35,330
Sultan is training
somebody over here.

1222
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:38,420
Why don't you kill them?
Are you waiting for my orders?

1223
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,760
Okay, brother.

1224
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:50,140
"Forget all your worries."

1225
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:54,740
"Resolve all the knots."

1226
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:59,340
"You are totally devastated."

1227
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:04,500
"Why are you dreaming, dear?"

1228
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:10,420
"Come and play."

1229
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:34,130
Jaggu, call up Daya.

1230
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:39,620
Tell him that the boy is killed.

1231
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:41,460
Tell him.

1232
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:42,970
Come on, speak up.

1233
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:45,240
- Hello.
- Hello, brother Daya.

1234
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,070
I've killed Sultan's man.

1235
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:49,340
Also kill Sultan.

1236
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:50,500
Yes, brother Daya.

1237
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:07,500
It's not good for him to stay here.

1238
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,420
Shift him.

1239
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,540
It's time to shift him.

1240
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,420
And then with the help of Vivek sir

1241
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,780
Rocky and I escaped from the jail.

1242
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:29,980
And out first target was Daya.

1243
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:56,120
Jaggu.

1244
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:04,780
You've done a lot for Rocky.

1245
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:06,700
How can I repay your obligations?

1246
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:08,340
No, brother?

1247
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:12,220
Don't talk like this
and make me a stranger.

1248
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,340
No, Jaggu.

1249
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:18,340
You're not a stranger.

1250
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:23,600
Henceforth, you are our brother.

1251
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:28,120
Brother.

1252
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:34,900
Brother, we incurred a huge loss.

1253
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:38,020
I will become a pauper in this way.

1254
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:39,420
No, this is not fair.

1255
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,780
What do we do?

1256
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:44,740
Party has paid us.
And they are angry on us.

1257
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:46,580
We are tensed.

1258
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:50,900
Brother, I hate tension.

1259
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:53,140
Fresh stock will arrive soon.

1260
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:55,900
From every corner of the country.

1261
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:58,060
That's okay. But when
will we get the stock in hand?

1262
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:00,460
On Ganesha festival.

1263
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:02,220
How do we trust?
How do we know?

1264
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:05,950
Hey. Ganu, tell him in his language.

1265
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:10,190
Never ask an ocean about
the quantity of salt he can give.

1266
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:12,970
Don't ask the sea,
how much salt it can give.

1267
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:15,670
Hey, did you understand?

1268
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:17,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

1269
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:19,510
So leave.

1271
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:27,660
Nana sir.

1272
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:30,660
I've taken a big
risk by promising them.

1273
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,260
Our stock is seized.

1274
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:36,060
Daya and Kale are not with us.

1275
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:39,060
Opposition is already targeting us.

1276
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:41,060
How do arrange for the fresh stock?

1277
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:42,900
And how do we deliver them?

1278
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:45,340
I am there.

No matter how big a cloud is,
it cannot move the mountains.

Ganu.

1281
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:57,390
Deal must be struck
on the day of campaign.

1282
01:28:57,470 --> 01:29:01,640
I want money as well as power.

1283
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:03,740
But this job must be done.

1284
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:13,540
Get the permission. Go.

1285
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:15,380
Permission?

1286
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,060
- For what?
- For taking out rally by Nana.

1287
01:29:18,410 --> 01:29:19,620
Do this, sir.

1288
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:23,180
Give us an application
signed by Nana.

1289
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:25,420
I will give that application to madam.

1290

Once approved by
her you can go ahead.

- She's my senior.
- She must be your senior. Not mine.

Gaikwad.

1294

Tell her not to cross my ways.

1295
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:48,740
Because anyone trying to
mess with us will get buried.

Will you provide us

has tried hands on you.

- Let's go.

from your promise now. Okay?

You will get only the
amount Nana has decided.

Is that clear to you? No?

to kill him in the jail.

statement is not recorded anywhere.

after this incidence?

No one knows.
I mean, what happened to him?

Gaikwad, I will solve
this case in no time.

- Bring professor Digambar to me.
- Yes, madam.

Don't worry, Ajay.

We will try our best to make sure
Rocky gets the least punishment.

to come and see you on that night.

for you from Sanjana and Rahul.

him from your house.

Although being a brother,
being a policeman

1413
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,310
I couldn't do
anything for my sister.

Because you stopped me.

I want to apologize to you

for calling you here for a meeting.

1421
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:12,050

you about everything

I know you will be troubled
recalling those things again.

Nothing, there was a little problem.

1433
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:53,710
Is your brother with you?

1434
01:39:53,790 --> 01:39:54,890
Yes, he is with me.

1435
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:57,590
- Are you alright?
- Yes, dad. I am fine.

1436
01:39:57,670 --> 01:39:58,700
Never mind then.

1437
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:00,010
How much time you
will take to reach home?

1438
01:40:00,090 --> 01:40:02,250
- Maybe 2 hours or so.
- Okay, fine. Bye.

1439
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:06,530
- Yes, Vivek.
- Yes, uncle.

1440
01:40:06,970 --> 01:40:08,530
Reach home as quickly as possible.

1441
01:40:08,730 --> 01:40:12,560
Sanjana said there's
nothing to worry.

1442
01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:14,970
I left for home.

1443
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:18,890
But when I reached home and saw...

1444
01:40:27,970 --> 01:40:29,020
Rahul.

1445
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:30,280
Just see who's here. Rahul.

1446
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:33,270
Rahul, talk to me. What happened?

1447
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:34,330
Rahul.

1448
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,330
Aunt. Rahul.

1449
01:40:37,420 --> 01:40:39,210
Aunt. Aunt.

1450
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:41,680
Aunt.

1451
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:43,050
What happened, aunt?

1452
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:44,650
Who had come here?

1453
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:46,510
Aunt, speak up.

1454
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:47,990
Tell me, who had come here?

1455
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:50,270
Sanjana. Sanjana.

1456
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,440
Sanjana. Speak up.

1457
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:57,030
Look who's here?

1458
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:58,420
Sanjana, talk to me.

1459
01:40:58,870 --> 01:40:59,900
Talk to me.

1460
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:01,150
See, who's here?

1461
01:41:01,230 --> 01:41:03,600
Sanjana, look who's here?

1462
01:41:05,390 --> 01:41:06,860
Sanjana, look who's here.

1463
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:11,300
Speak up, Sanjana.

1464
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:23,990
Calm down.

1465
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:31,920
I will not sit quiet
until they are not punished.

1466
01:41:34,110 --> 01:41:36,040
Now, whoever will
commit such a crime

1467
01:41:37,470 --> 01:41:39,160
I will punish him.

1468
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:41,580
No.

1469
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:57,990
Rocky!

1470
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:02,080
Court has given you permission
for immersion of Ajay's ashes.

1471
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:48,640
"All the worries are overcome."

1472
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:51,160
"When You're there, Lord."

1473
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:56,520
"There's no friend as good as You,
in this world. O Lord."

1474
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:59,680
"You come on Your devotees call."

1475
01:43:59,890 --> 01:44:02,280
"To help your devotees."

1476
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:05,920
"This strength is all by Your mercy."

1477
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,280
"Bless me with your help today."

1478
01:44:08,610 --> 01:44:13,560
"I get emotional
singing in your praise."

1479
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:18,680
"It's your blessings,
that safeguard me."

1480
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:21,840
"The voice is heard
in the skies, Morya."

1481
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:24,440
"The voice is heard in the skies."

1482
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,600
"The voice is heard in the skies."

1483
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:29,880
"Glory to Lord Ganesha."

1484
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:32,000
"The voice is heard in the skies."

1485
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:35,360
"Glory to Lord Ganesha."

1486
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:38,040
"The voice is heard
in the skies, Morya."

1487
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,680
"The voice is heard in the skies."

1488
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:42,360
You!

1489
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:45,680
- Hey, spare me.
- I spare you.

1490
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:47,090
Thank you.

1491
01:44:47,230 --> 01:44:50,740
Tell me how you framed me.

1492
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:52,750
Also about Nana's businesses.

1493
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:55,160
Yes, I will tell you.

1494
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:56,240
Right now.

1495
01:44:56,670 --> 01:44:57,800
But now...

1496
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:59,680
"The voice is heard in the skies."

1497
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,800
"Glory to Lord Ganesha."

1498
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,040
"The voice is heard in the skies."

1499
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:08,360
"Glory to Lord Ganesha."

1500
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,320
"The voice is heard in the skies."

1501
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:13,720
"Glory to Lord Ganesha."

1502
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,680
"The voice is heard in the skies."

1503
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,840
"Glory to Lord Ganesha."

1504
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:19,560
He's Rocky!

1505
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:22,060
He has killed our men.

1506
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:10,000
Arrest him.

1507
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:19,520
Arrest Jaggu.

1508
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:23,200
Madam, I am ready to take
up all the murder charges on me.

1509
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:24,880
He has committed many murders.

1510
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:28,200
He's a hardcore criminal.

1511
01:48:36,590 --> 01:48:37,420
Jaggu!

1512
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:42,280
I'm doing the right thing.

1513
01:48:43,830 --> 01:48:46,080
I used to wander
on streets in childhood.

1514
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:49,880
People used to look
at me as if I was a thief.

1515
01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:55,780
But no one took me
in his arms and asked me

1516
01:48:56,480 --> 01:49:02,960
where my parents are.

1517
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:06,000
Where my family is.

1518
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,560
I never knew what family is.

1519
01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:17,510
But this family needs you.

1520
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:21,760
Rocky.

1521
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,160
Will you come to see me in jail?

1522
01:49:28,130 --> 01:49:29,080
Rocky!

1523
01:49:56,790 --> 01:49:58,480
Rocky, I am sorry.

1524
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:00,800
No, dad.

1525
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:05,550
'I made a grave
mistake in knowing you.'

1526
01:50:05,870 --> 01:50:08,380
'I could not believe when saw it'

1527
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:12,070
'and at the same time
a hope forced me to live.'

1528
01:50:12,150 --> 01:50:16,980
'But at that moment Nada came
and threatened to leave the city.'

1529
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:21,680
'I got scared. I fell at his feet
and begged for her life.'

1530
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:23,830
'And I calmed down Vivek'

1531
01:50:24,010 --> 01:50:28,280
'and with his help we left the city
and went to some far off place to hide.'

1532
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:38,480
'Since past three years
someone has been waiting for you.'
