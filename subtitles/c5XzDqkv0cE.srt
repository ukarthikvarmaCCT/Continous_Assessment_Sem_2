1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,660
...This is not being followed. This poses a danger to the lives of the people sitting behind as well as my life

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,900
And when I go home, it becomes a danger for my family as well

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,500
This extremely important document that I am writing and handing in...

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,040
Greetings, friends!

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,000
It has been more than 10 days since the you-tuber "Flying Beast",

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,880
that is, Gaurav Taneja raised some critical flight safety issues in Air Asia Airlines on his social media

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,460
Due to which, he was even suspended from his job as a pilot

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,960
But even today, there has been no response from the airline regarding these specific issues

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,040
Whether these issues persist or not and what the airline is doing to avoid them- nothing at all!

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,880
This is something that concerns all of us

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,840
If we book a flight on Air Asia today, a question arises- Is our safety in danger?

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,240
Come, let us understand these issues in detail

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,740
I spoke to Gaurav about these issues

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:58,280
One of these issues is so critical that it might be the reason behind the rising cases of corona virus in the country

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,720
Come, let us see

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,840
-Gaurav,  coming straight to the point, the people that you are up against will try their best to divert the issue

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,280
But I would like to keep this to the point

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,140
Let us talk about the three safety issues that concern the people

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,980
The first safety issue, as you had pointed out, was that of paid leave

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,680
Could you please elaborate on that?

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:27,400
This issue is precisely about sick leave and how it has been made punitive

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:34,000
If a pilot is sick, then how is he punished for taking a sick (leave)

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,360
In most jobs you work for five days- from Monday to Friday- and Saturdays and Sundays are off

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,460
For pilots, they pilot the flight for 6 days and get the seventh day off

25
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,420
These are the off days

26
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,200
On the other hand, there are sick leaves

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,200
No matter which job you have, you can take a sick leave if you are unwell

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,440
and there are a specified number of sick leaves in every job per year- for example, around 10-15

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,060
The same goes for the pilots

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:01,660
Now Gaurav says that if you take a sick leave in Air Asia, then it is counted as an off day

31
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:09,040
-This is a normal month with the dates written. Assume a pilot had flights from the 4th until the 9th

32
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,560
He flies for 6 days

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,900
He should get an off on the seventh day, as per the regulations

34
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,600
So, he got an off on the 10th

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,560
And then, he can work again for 6 days

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:26,020
Let me explain with the help of an example- Suppose, the pilot got sick on 9th, right before his off day

37
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,040
and he got so sick that he was not in the condition to go to work

38
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,400
If he takes a sick leave on the 9th, then he would have a flight scheduled on 10th, despite it being an off day

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,380
and the company would assume that 9th was your off day and that you were resting

40
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,600
So, counting six days from the 10th... it can make you fly again until the 15th

41
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,540
A very important thing to understand here is that

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,220
Are you taking a holiday when you are sick?

43
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,740
Are you enjoying?

44
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:00,880
On my off days, I do gym, I shoot my videos and edit them and I spend time with my family

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,980
Basically, it is a time to let go off my fatigue

46
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,640
But when you are running high fever, are you recovering from fatigue?

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,280
You are suffering in your sickness

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,100
You are not recovering from fatigue

49
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,720
The company assumes that you are recovering

50
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,680
When in fact, sickness adds on to your fatigue

51
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,720
Now, assume that when that pilot came to fly on the 15th,

52
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,900
then he had no time to recover from his fatigue from the 4th until the 15th

53
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,360
Imagine how fatigued the pilot will be on the last day, if he is flying on 15th

54
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,280
Imagine if he has to get up at 3 in the morning to report for a flight (and) do four sectors

55
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,760
Furthermore, if its a normal job and your're a little fatigued, then it's fine- it can be endured

56
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,400
But if a pilot flies a plane for 15 days in a state of fatigue,

57
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,260
then it becomes a safety risk for all the passengers on board that plane

58
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,080
if he is unable to fly the plane properly

59
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,020
-And here, I'd like to show you a study by the FAA- the Federal Aviation Administration, which is

60
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,500
the regulatory body in the US, akin to the DGCA here

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,060
It was quite a significant study

62
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:08,640
The first page on it reads, "Fatigue threatens aviation safety because it increases the risk of pilot error

63
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,880
that could lead to an accident."

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,520
Let me give you some background information regarding the second issue

65
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,780
If you've ever seen outside the window of your aeroplane while landing.

66
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,420
then you might have observed that the portion beneath the wings starts to tilt

67
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,040
This part is called a flap

68
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,480
You can control several aspects of landing by determining how open or how closed the flap is

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,160
If the flaps are open all the way, then it is called a full flap position

70
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,800
If they're not open all the way, there's a position in between- the flap 3 position

71
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,420
Using the flaps, you can control two main aspects of landing

72
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,540
The first is, you can control your descent angle if your speed is constant

73
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,700
In the full flap position, the descent angle is more steep- that is, the plane lands in this manner

74
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,960
In the half flap position, that is, the flap 3 position,  the plane lands in this manner

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,980
You can clearly see this in the diagram

76
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,860
But another very important point which happens in the commercial airlines is that

77
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,360
If your descent angle is constant, then you can control the speed of the aeroplane by using flaps

78
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,580
In the full flap position, the aeroplane would descend slowly

79
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,280
You would have more time and more control over the aeroplane because of the slow descent

80
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,920
In the half flap position/flap three position,

81
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,820
the speed of the aeroplane would be slightly more during the descent

82
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:26,540
-Both Flap 3 and Flap Full are recommended configurations for landing

83
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,160
by the operator/manufacturer, which is the Airbus

84
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,880
Both are safe. But the pilot needs to evaluate the conditions for both before he makes a landing

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,500
The fact of the matter is that a Flap 3 landing saves fuel

86
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,660
It saves fuel because you're not landing the plane at a steep angle and bringing it down gradually

87
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,660
and all the airlines recommend it

88
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:53,080
But there are some conditions that call for a full flap landing, for example, in case of a short runway

89
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,280
or if there are mountains around the runway in a hilly region

90
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,960
then there is not enough space for the plane to descend gradually

91
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,620
In such cases, a steep descent is required with full flap landings

92
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:10,140
Now, Gaurav says that Air Asia forces its pilots to ensure that 98% of their landings are flap 3 landings

93
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,380
if they want a bonus

94
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,900
So, pressure is mounted on them subconsciously to encourage them to opt for Flap 3 landings

95
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,520
If the pilots do not do this, they would lose out on their bonus

96
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,860
which is a risk for the safety of the passengers in the airports where a Flap 3 landing would not be the right choice

97
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,300
-We got an e-mail from the company that we should opt for Flap 3 landings 98% of the times

98
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,560
I had received a specific e-mail in the month of May

99
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,300
that in the month of March, 71% of my landings were Flap 3

100
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,180
which is a non-compliance of SOP

101
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,820
Everything in aviation runs via these Standard Operating Procedures

102
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:51,680
If any pilot deviates from this then he becomes liable for an enquiry or questioning by the company

103
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,080
And...

104
00:06:53,260 --> 00:07:00,940
So, I first got this email in March and a follow up on 31st of May,2020

105
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,140
where my head of operations told me in written/in black and white that

106
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,560
this is a punitive policy and that I, as a pilot, am indulging in non compliance of SOP

107
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,220
and this SOP is approved by the DGCA

108
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,380
and that the company would be happy to retrain me as I was not following the SOP

109
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,120
and in order to make this more punitive, my bonus would be deducted as well

110
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:35,740
-Could you show proof for our viewers? Any document of Air Asia with their policy written down

111
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,140
which reads that one needs 98% flap landings to secure a bonus?

112
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:48,600
-So, I have an email, Dhruv, which is was sent by Head of operations- Captain Manish Uppal

113
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,260
It is dated 17th January, 2020

114
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,200
Before I show you this email, let me tell you what is a green operating procedure

115
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,720
Airbus provides some operating cost saving techniques

116
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,000
and Flap 3 landing comes under green operating procedures as well

117
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,080
So, this heading is- Flap 3 landing and idle reverse SOP non compliance

118
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,480
and it clearly states that if you do not do this, then it amounts to non compliance of SOP

119
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,560
..that your compliance rate for green operating procedure will improve after this email

120
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,800
and we won't have to apply demerits for the non compliance of SOP

121
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,280
What are these demerits? Everybody's points are collected at the end of the year

122
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,460
and the ones with more points get more bonus

123
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,320
and those with lesser points get lesser bonus

124
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,700
So if you make lesser Flap 3 landings, then fewer points would be accumulated

125
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,820
and you would get lesser bonus at the end of the year

126
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,240
So, Dhruv, I am sending you one more email which shows that the pilots have a target of 98%

127
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,800
The heading of this email is- Non compliance to SOP and Fuel Efficiency Procedures

128
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,580
I received this mail from the management on the 4th of May

129
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,400
"Our Key Performance Index (KPI) takes into account all scenarios" -

130
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:01,220
be it the environmental conditions or steep approach or tail wind or wet runway or pilot fatigue

131
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,580
The KPI has been formulated keeping all things into consideratio

132
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,100
".. and is on par with other AOCs in our group and other Leading world Airlines

133
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,400
Based on our data for the month of your compliance for reduced flap landings was 71% versus

134
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,340
target KPI of 98%."

135
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,880
-I have a question. Is this the case with only Air Asia or the other airlines as well?

136
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,800
As far as my experience goes, there was no number given to the pilots where I worked before

137
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,060
Now, I will tell you how this affects flight safety

138
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,740
The report of the investigation of the Air India crash in Mangalore in 2010

139
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,700
recommended that this could be a contributing factor

140
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,580
that their pilots were repeatedly counselled for hard landings

141
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:58,200
Boeing states that if the impact is lesser than 2.1G while landing, then you do not require counselling

142
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,900
But their pilots were counselled even if they had a landing impact of 1.9G

143
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,780
So, they probably felt that hard landings could invite counselling

144
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,540
So, in order to smoothen their landing, they were floating over the runway

145
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,140
and they used another 500-800 feet of extra runway

146
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,240
There were several other problems in the approach

147
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,820
But in this specific problem, they used up another very useful portion of the runway which was about 500-800 feet

148
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,860
So all these things keep accumulating at the back of the mind

149
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,240
And one day, when all the things keep going wrong, everything will align

150
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,940
and then that leads to an accident

151
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:43,540
-Another thing Dhruv- Ever since this issue has been raised, the pilots of some other companies..

152
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,320
some people develop a "macho" attitude

153
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,440
So, someone sent a post on social media which was very disturbing for me

154
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,800
Some people are saying that they would stick to the 98% even in Imphal

155
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,440
So, this type of an attitude which only few pilots have

156
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,880
has become into a "this vs this" issue

157
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,560
It has not been made into an ego issue which is very dangerous

158
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,060
Now, imagine

159
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,280
that pilot is committing to landing in an airport like Imphal, which has a steep glide slope

160
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,820
without even considering the environmental conditions on that day,

161
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,600
without considering anything

162
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,720
they're saying that no matter when they go to Imphal, they'd opt for a Flap 3 landing

163
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,960
Now, imagine a heavy aircraft. Imagine tail winds at Imphal.

164
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,200
Imagine (that) its raining and its a bad weather day and the runway is wet

165
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,680
The drainage conditions in Indian airport and the grooving specifications...

166
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,900
I will not go into too much detail about that

167
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,880
Imagine all the environmental conditions are against this flap 3

168
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,640
and still the pilot decides to do flap 3 because he has already committed that he would do so

169
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,800
because he wants to achieve the target of 98% and also,

170
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,040
if that pilot is not rested well and he is fatigued

171
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,880
he is operating on the 15th, because he had applied for a sick and his off day was cancelled

172
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,640
Imagine all these factors combined and now think where we are going

173
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,460
In aviation, no accident happens just because of one factor

174
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,020
It is never going to happen solely because of one flap 3 factor

175
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,520
This will be a combination of all the factors and one day, all the things will align

176
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,880
and a mishap will occur

177
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,200
We should be proactive in rectifying mistakes right where they are

178
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,860
It has been our habit since forever that we wait for something to happen and then find out why that happened

179
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,160
-The third issue that you raised is the most critical in my opinion because

180
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,480
basically, if the DGCA circulars on COVID19 were ignored,

181
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,960
then I think that the exponential rise of the COVID cases in our country today

182
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,620
could be because the airlines did not follow the rules

183
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,620
They cases that were coming in, those that could have been stopped right at the airport itself,

184
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,620
if there were sound rules at the airport, maybe this situation could have been avoided

185
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,160
Do you also feel the same way?

186
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,060
-Dhruv, when these talks were ongoing in March,

187
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,320
then there were several times when these procedures were not being followed

188
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,860
I always intimated the company. We also have a WhatsApp group of pilots

189
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,620
that is run by management pilots.  Now  calingl it official or unofficial is upto you

190
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,120
So, I notified this there as well

191
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,740
The others raised similar concerns. But it was on 23rd of March, specifically, when I saw

192
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,900
that a lot of procedures were not being followed and carelessness was on the rise

193
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,140
Then I documented it. We have a report called the "Voyage Report"

194
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,840
which is read by the captain/PIC of the flight

195
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:43,400
I specifically wrote there that DGCA circular number so-and-so is not being followed

196
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,880
And I, being the captain and the PIC of the flight, I have the full responsibility

197
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,180
Until I ensure the safety of the passengers sitting behind me,

198
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,040
I have the full authority to sign(or not sign) the document...

199
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,220
And whenever we sign the document stating that we accept this flight,

200
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,420
We take full responsibility of that aircraft

201
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:12,140
So when I know that there is such a glaring shortcoming, how do I accept it without doing anything about it?

202
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:18,520
-Did you, as a pilot, have authority to delay the flight if the rules were not being followed?

203
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,860
-Yes, Dhruv. The PIC has full authority to do that. And I did delay a flight on 23rd of March

204
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,840
and I did write down the reason that the circulars were not being followed. There were other points as well

205
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:34,220
The document that I signed required me to fill in the flight arrival and departure time (as for all the flights)

206
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,300
That document is extremely important and the management reviews it very carefully

207
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,760
If any flight gets delayed by a minute and we write down that it was delayed, then we get a call the next day

208
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,740
asking, "Captain, what was the reason for the delay of the flight?

209
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,500
Can you give us any explanation or how can we improve it?"

210
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,060
So...

211
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:58,360
OTP is such an important matter for us that we keep stressing on being on time

212
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,580
But when a captain writes it down and tells you that some rules are not being followed

213
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,700
which is risking the lives of the people sitting behind as well as his life

214
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,840
and it would be a risk to his family when he goes back home

215
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,260
This extremely important document that I am writing down and handing in,

216
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,020
I never got an email or a call regarding it yet

217
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:20,140
asking the details of what was not being followed as per his complaint

218
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,780
and how could it be improved in the future

219
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,740
I was never contacted regarding this

220
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,760
We always try and be on time because being on time is company's PR

221
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,700
Which I agree, is extremely important

222
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,060
And we contribute fully to make that happen

223
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,280
But

224
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
there's something more important than that- safety.

225
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,700
-Dhruv, let me explain it with an example. Say there are a 100 employees in a company

226
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,100
50 out of them would not be concerned with what is happening around them

227
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,840
40 out of them would take cognizance of the wrongs being done and would whisper amongst themselves

228
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but they will not take this up

229
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:02,380
8 out of those would tell the boss about the wrongdoings in written

230
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,740
The boss says that necessary steps would be taken

231
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,260
Then those 8 employees would eventually take a back seat thinking this is how it happens in India

232
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:12,100
But only 1 out of those would stand up and say

233
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,800
that he has had it enough and has brought things to the attention of the authorities enough times

234
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,320
and that he has taken it up enough number of times

235
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,760
But yet, nothing is done about it

236
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,740
and he refuses to work in those conditions because that would endanger the lives of everyone

237
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,400
and endanger the lives of his family and him

238
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,080
I stand up and I refuse to work till all these things continue and till negligence reigns

239
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:37,800
So that was my attitude. I stood up and on 23rd of March, I wrote it down and refused to work on 24th

240
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:46,500
I said that a lot of negligence was taking place and that it was putting everyone's lives at risk- passengers, crew, and my family

241
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,840
That is why I took this step

242
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,280
And all these policies- regarding COVID, flap 3...

243
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,960
In the case of sickness, their man days are being saved if they relabel sick as an off

244
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,580
then they are able to get extra work done and are able to save up on man days

245
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,840
If you do not follow the COVID guidelines because it would incur more costs in the form of  more staffs

246
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,620
and extra equipment- they would have to get sanitizers installed and arrange for PPEs

247
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,200
Everything comes at a cost

248
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,340
And as you know that there is direct fuel saving in the case of Flap 3

249
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,560
All these policies that I stood up against are the profit making policies of the company

250
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:27,040
And the company was noticing that time and again this person was standing up and pointing fingers at policies that

251
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,720
hamper our profit

252
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,920
Even though it was safety that I stood up for

253
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,880
So when there was requirement for pilots, the company kept taking in complaints without saying anything

254
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,360
But as soon as the COVID time arrived and their operations slumped

255
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,680
and  they were aware that even when things opened up, they would not need so many pilots

256
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,900
They directly targeted me and then threw me out of the country

257
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,040
-I saw "boycott Air Asia" trending on Twitter

258
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
The media also took up your issue

259
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,740
The Minister of Aviation also responded to that tweet

260
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,340
But there has been no progress regarding this. What do you think is

261
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,880
being done by the Ministry and the Airlines in the meantime?

262
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,580
-I saw that this was trending on Twitter the day I put up this video but I had no idea that this would trend

263
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,140
and who made this trend. The people took this upon themselves to make it trend

264
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,380
After that, DGCI also made a public tweet that they would take this up

265
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,420
that somebody has raised a complaint against some airline

266
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:28,120
But I never got a specific acknowledgement from the DGCA or any communication from the aviation Minister

267
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,580
I have not yet received an official confirmation or communication from anywhere

268
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:37,900
Dhruv, I'd only like to point out that this is a fact based case and I would request the authorities

269
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,720
to conduct a fair investigation into this

270
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,720
I want nothing else. All I want is a fair investigation

271
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,580
The most important thing is that Air Asia should respond to these questions

272
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,560
What answer does Air Asia have to the three safety issues that have been raised

273
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,680
The Air Asia must say something- either accept or deny these allegations

274
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,100
Share this video so that it reaches more and more people and that it mounts pressure on Air Asia

275
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,880
to respond to the question of whether our safety is in danger or not

276
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,060
