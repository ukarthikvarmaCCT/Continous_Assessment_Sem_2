Shame on you.

42
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:44,233
Idiot, he is always after me.
And keeps staring at me.

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,160
I just go to his friend,
Rajan and complain.

44
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
Oh God!

45
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,420
Look, Mr Rajan.

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,480
Your friend misbehave with me.

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,720
Either you make him
understand or I will...

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,680
How beautiful this place is!

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,120
But not more than you.

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,960
Looks like you are here for
the first time.

51
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,600
My name is Rajan. What's your name?

52
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,720
Why shall I tell you? Nothing.

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
Shut up.

54
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,160
I was feeling like slapping him.

55
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,280
Stupid! What does
he think of himself?

56
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,180
But the boy is handsome.

57
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,820
I consider even talking to
such people as an insult.

58
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,860
What is this?

59
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,300
Dance.
- Dance?

60
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,140
This is called dance.

61
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,700
With whom will you dance there?

62
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,780
With a girl.

63
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,700
A big twist is going
to come in my life.

64
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,300
Have you ever danced in your life?

65
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,298
So what? But today
I'll beat everyone in dance.

66
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:08,166
Twist, twist.

67
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,340
Twist, twist.

68
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,580
Come on, dance there.

69
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,330
Bansi, Asha.

70
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,740
Rajan, Jyoti.

71
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,100
Look Madhu, those boys are dancing
so well. Aren't they?

72
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,900
I'll be back. I also go.

73
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,420
Tomorrow we will go to Char Chinar.

74
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,500
I heard it's a very nice place.

75
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,820
Yes, of course.

76
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,740
Excuse me.

77
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,660
What?

78
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,060
I mean excuse me.

79
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,620
What?

80
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,740
Let's go on the field.

81
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,900
What do you mean?

82
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,860
I mean together...

83
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,060
let's go dance.

84
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,980
I am prepared to dance today.

85
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,260
No one can beat me in dance today.

86
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,500
Bansi.

87
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,900
Yes dear.

88
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,860
Today I am also
in very terrific form.

89
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,860
Let's go.

90
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,740
What are you doing?
Don't you feel ashamed?

91
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,780
Where is the manager?
Bansi, let's go from here.

92
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,060
Please, forgive this idiot.

93
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,300
One, two, three, four...

94
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,620
Who are you?

95
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,180
Actually, I am looking for two girls
who lives in another room.

96
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,340
Get out.
- Actually madam...

97
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,260

Get out. - Sir, listen to me.

98
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,260
Get out.
- Listen to me, sir.

99
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,700
Room no. 10.

100
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,980
God, I hope that girl is inside.

101
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,380
What happened?

102
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,700
Did you check the room?

103
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,260
Yes, a zero and a one.

104
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,700
I mean room no. 10.

105
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:37,881
Room no, 10...

106
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:40,483
You go inside.

107
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,850
I'll guard.

108
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:44,933
Go inside.

109
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:53,940
"I came for you, leaving the world."

110
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,540
You.
- Oh, God!

111
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,460
Who are you?

112
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,140
Who gave you permission
to come here?

113
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,400
Oh, God!

114
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,000
Bansi.

115
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:19,890
Where are you going?

116
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,440
Wait.

117
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:31,122
Stop there.

118
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:32,044
Wait.

119
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:42,388
Oh, God!

120
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,060
Have you seen the condition
of my face because of you?

121
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,860
Because of me?

122
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,700
I got insulted because of you.

123
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,260
My eyes can never be deceived.

124
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,060
Oh, shut up.

125
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,940
First you slapped cake
on our face...

126
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,940
and now you are knocking the door.

127
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,460
The keys are with me. Stay inside.

128
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,340
Let's go and ask at the counter.

129
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,020
Look at us.

130
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,900
Sir, does Asha live in room no. 10?

131
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,500
393.
- What do you mean?

132
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,060
She left this hotel
this morning itself.

133
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,380
What happened to you?

134
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,860
Mind your own business.

135
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,020
I told you that
she lives in room no. 10.

136
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,300
No, it's not possible.

137
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,260
She might be staying
in some other hotel.

138
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,740
Let's do one thing. Change our
clothes and search for them.

139
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,580
No, you go alone...

140
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,180
and I am going to Jyoti.

141
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,580
Char Chinar.

142
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,940
Bansi.

143
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,820
I made a fool of Bansi.

144
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,300
He must have gone to Char
Chinar looking for us.

145
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,660
What are you doing?
- I did not do anything.

146
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:56,226
Oh, it's you.

147
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,980
Hey! Earthquake in Kashmir?

148
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,460
Now say, who made fool to whom?

149
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,260
You. How many have
I told you to not follow me.

150
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,540
Who came after you?
I am standing in front of you.

151
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:15,418
Really?

152
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:18,107
Oh, God!

153
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,900
You are such a nice guy.

154
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,660
Why do you trouble me?

155
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,740
I am innocent.

156
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,140
And handsome too.

157
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,900
No, I am not handsome.

158
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,380
Oh God! Oh, my waist!

159
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,980
My waist! Where is my room?

160
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,140
My room.

161
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,100
Oh!

162
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,380
Hey! take us to Char Chinar.

163
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,900
Oh dear!

164
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,780
Sail the boat little faster.

165
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,380
Hello.

166
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,980
You liar.

167
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,980
I say stop the boat.

168
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:29,468
I say, stop the boat.

169
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:35,551
What do you think of yourself?

170
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,300
Great.

171
00:11:57,607 --> 00:12:00,167
Madam, I took you here safely.

172
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:36,260
"Everyone has seen moon, what would
I give to it. I saw you."

173
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:41,349
"I saw you, I saw everything."

174
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,460
"Everyone has seen moon."

175
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,580
"There is anger in the eyes."

176
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,900
"There is anger in the eyes."

177
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,380
"But the heart agrees in the heart."

178
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,980
"Now whatever the world thinks."

179
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:31,940
"Now whatever the world thinks,
why should I know. I know you..."

180
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,220
"I know everything.
I know you, I know everything."

181
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,060
"Everyone has seen moon."

182
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,300
"My heart adores your lips."

183
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,860
"My heart adores your lips."

184
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:23,740
"If there is someone as
beautiful as you..."

185
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,340
"why should I adore her,
I adore you."

186
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,540
"I adore you, I adore everything."

187
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,940
"Everyone has seen moon."

188
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,900
"My heart called you..."

189
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:12,380
"My heart called you..."

190
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:19,380
"Now what's there with God?"
"Now what's there with God?"

191
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:27,940
"What should I ask for? I asked
for you, I asked for everything."

192
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,060
"Everyone has seen moon."

193
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:43,380
"Everyone has seen moon, why should
I look at it. I saw you..."

194
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,860
"I saw everything.
I saw you, I saw everything."

195
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,740
"Everyone has seen moon."

196
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,340
What is this?

197
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,460
I am shivering with cold.

198
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,460
That's why I am giving
a little heat.

199
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,060
And what's that?

200
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,980
This...

201
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,140
I am knitting sweater.

202
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,580
For whom?

203
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,860
For my wife.

204
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,540
Like the Gorkha people.

205
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,660
But how do you know
that it'll fit her?

206
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,460
I am making 36 size.

207
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,980
It is a common size.

208
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,900
Whichever girl will fit this
sweater, I will marry her...

209
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,220
and make her grandmother
to my grandchildren.

210
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,220
Really?

211
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,820
You forgot about Jyoti?

212
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,420
Hands up.

213
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,340
Jyoti hit me on my waist so hard...

214
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,260
that my waist is paining.

215
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,940
And I came into the room.

216
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,260
Listen to me.

217
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,460
You also give up.

218
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,380
Asha will not accept you.

219
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,740
Where are you going in
this cold weather?

220
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,900
Take this blanket.

221
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,260
Asha's stubbornness
and indifference won my heart.

222
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,260
Today she have to believe
in my love.

223
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,060
Where are you going?

224
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,020
Listen.

225
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,060
You are here again?

226
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,660
Look, how beautiful the weather is!

227
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,580
The other side of lake...

228
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,260
that mountains covered with snow...

229
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,420
sound of two lovers singing...

230
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,980
a poet was right...

231
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:58,900
this air, this ocean, this moon,
I wish to spend my life here.

232
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,420
You realize
the beautiful sight of nature...

233
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,060
it's strange.

234
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,060
Why?

235
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,140
Am I not a human?

236
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,820
You are human
but do not have humanity.

237
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,820
I want to say something.

238
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,580
Please, why are you bothering me?

239
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,740
For God sake, leave me alone.

240
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,740
I hate you.

241
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,420
Your indifference can kill someone.

242
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,980
Maybe you never thought about it.

243
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,340
I don't want to listen anything.

244
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,180
If this is your wish then I swear...

245
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,780
I'll change this hatred into love.

246
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,380
Today you are rejecting
my feelings...

247
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,220
keep in my mind...

248
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,420
one day the same feeling
will not let you sleep.

249
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,260
What was he saying?

250
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,740
Don't talk about him.

251
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,140
Looks like, he intend to sit
downstairs all night.

252
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,020
Go and tell him, he'll get sick in
this cold weather.

253
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,380
I don't care.

254
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,660
Asha, it's not good to hurt anyone.

255
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,660
Lest it happen that you start
loving him. - Please, Madhu.

256
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,540
What are you watching?

257
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,500
Nothing.

258
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,660
I know, you are saddened
by not seeing Rajan.

259
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,740
Sad that too for Rajan?

260
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,740
Yes.

261
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,620
Because your pride is hurt.

262
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,940
You must have thought that
he is still here.

263
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,340
Yes.

264
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,980
Madam, your letter.

265
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,180
Whose letter is this?

266
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,100
Prakash has send the letter...

267
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,260
Dad is not well.
We have to leave today.

268
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,060
Dad.

269
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,660
Asha, my dear.

270
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,140
Hello, uncle.
- Hello. - How are you?

271
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,020
My health deteriorated suddenly.

272
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,340
But how could
I die without seeing my daughter?

273
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,260
Dad, what are you saying?

274
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,460
Don't worry, dear. Until you
get married, I'll not die.

275
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,740
This is my wish.

276
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,980
Dad, where is Prakash? He didn't
even come to the airport.

277
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,220
Oh, may be he must have gone on
a visit somewhere.

278
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,860
Dear, Prakash served me very well.

279
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,100
He is very close to me.

280
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,900
He has everything...

281
00:22:19,544 --> 00:22:21,464
but no parents.

282
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,480
You are there.

283
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,280
Yes, dear. My friend's only son...

284
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,640
he was 10 year old
at the time of his father's death.

285
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,440
Asha, what are you thinking?

286
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,800
Nothing, dad.

287
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,720
Looks like you must
be missing Kashmir.

288
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,200
Madhu, how was Kashmir?

289
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,360
It was great, uncle.

290
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,280
And you?

291
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
It was nice.

292
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,160
Okay, Asha, I am leaving.

293
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,600
Mom must be waiting.

294
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,600
Okay, dear. Asha, go with Madhu.

295
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,600
And take rest.

296
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,320
Bye, uncle.

297
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,280
God bless, dear.

298
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,960
Okay, Asha,
say my hello to aunt. - Okay.

299
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,520
And don't forget to come tomorrow.

300
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,560
Okay, I'll come.

301
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,680
Good night.

302
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,920
Asha.

303
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,600
Hello, Prakash.

304
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,440
Asha, I have decided to quit my
profession of doctor. - Why?

305
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,160
What? Is this what you call life?

306
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,960
I was just coming to receive you
when a patient arrived.

307
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,360
Nice excuse.

308
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,160
I don't make excuses
and that too from you.

309
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,600
Excuses are made from strangers.

310
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,120
What have you brought from Kashmir?

311
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,280
Memories.

312
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,000
Memories of beautiful scenery.

313
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,880
Your face looks like you
have lost something.

314
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,320
To gain beautiful memories,
you have to lose something.

315
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,120
What did you do in that time?

316
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,640
I didn't feel good after you left.

317
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,200
I was feeling lonely.

318
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,960
Why did this happened?

319
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,800
I think you need a partner.
A life partner.

320
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,440
I will get my life partner.

321
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:56,320
I am living in that hope. When
I get it, you will definitely know.

322
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,640
May God bless you.
I'll be happy for you.

323
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,480
'Your indifference can also
take someone's life.'

324
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,160
'You might never agree.'

325
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,360
'If this is your decision,
then today I also swear...'

326
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,120
'I'll change your hatred into love.'

327
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,640
'Today you rejected my love...'

328
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,840
'keep in mind, one day this feeling
will not let you sleep.'

329
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
What are you thinking?

330
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,160
I know, what are you thinking about.

331
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:23,281
What's wrong with you?

332
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,460
I don't know, Madhu.

333
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,580
Madhu, I used to hate Rajan.

334
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,860
But now, I keep
on thinking about him.

335
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,740
He was so passionate about me.

336
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,020
But I hurt him.

337
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,900
I don't know, where and how he is?

338
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,780
Can I not meet him again?

339
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,380
You have to move on.

340
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,260
This is better for you.

341
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:15,801
Happy birthday.
- Thank you. Come in.

342
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,400
Happy birthday, Rajan.
Thank you, Dr Sharma.

343
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,520
Hello.

344
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,460
May god bless you with 1000 lives.

345
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,540
Where is my gift?

346
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,100
Here it is?
- What's this?

347
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
See it yourself.

348
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,220
What is this?

349
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,660
Stethoscope.

350
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,740
I thought, it would
be useful for you.

351
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,980
I can hear heart beat without it.

352
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,300
Then leave your profession.

353
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,300
Why?

354
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,300
Only a poet or
a lover can hear heart beat...

355
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,780
without stethoscope not a doctor.

356
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,780
Come, meet my friends.

357
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,900
Keep this.

358
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,460
Dr Pintu, this is Pintu.
Miss . Asha. - Hello.

359
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,900
Mr and Mrs Mihir Chandani.
Mrs Asha. - Hello.

360
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,620
And he is my best friend...

361
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,300
Rajan.

362
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,540
Yes.

363
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,580
Asha, Rajan...
- Happy birthday, Dr Prakash.

364
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,940
Oh! thank you Dr Vijay.

365
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,540
They want to meet you.

366
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,700
Yes, of course. Excuse me.

367
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,300
Meet my Bhanu. Dr Prakash.

368
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,860
Happy birthday. Thank you.

369
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,580
Waiter. Bring the drink, please.

370
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,540
Please have some.

371
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,900
You too.

372
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,900
Excuse me.

373
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,300
Why don't you dance?

374
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,660
Please, Asha.

375
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,980
Come on, Raju. You have no idea
how good Asha dance.

376
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,660
She'll be very good
partner. Come on.

377
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,100
Please, excuse me.
I'll check on guests.

378
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,580
What are you wondering?

379
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,900
I am thinking
how my dream came true.

380
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,260
Asha, I fear if this reality
turns back into a dream.

381
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,900
Rajan.

382
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,900
I know, you hate me.

383
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,180
But still I want to
meet you for once.

384
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,380
Can you do this favor for me?

385
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,260
I...
- Please, do not refuse.

386
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,060
I want to say something to you.

387
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,940
I will never forget this favor.

388
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,660
I promise,
you'll never see me again.

389
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,780
I'll meet you.

390
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,860
Really?

391
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,460
Excuse me, what's your size?

392
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,780
Shut up.

393
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,540
Excuse me.

394
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,300
Sorry, wrong number.

395
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,180
Wrong number!
But I made a correct size.

396
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,740
But God made me a wrong number.

397
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,300
It's okay.
I'll wear this ladies sweater.

398
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,900
'What didn't I become,
beloved in your love?'

399
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,100
'I'll kiss you.
I knitted sweater for you.'

400
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,420
This is not mine. You were giving...

401
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,820
this to some other girl a while ago.

402
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,820
No, I made this only for you.

403
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,260
I searched for you...

404
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,620
please wear for once, Jyoti.

405
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,020
You want me to wear it?
- Yes. - Okay.

406
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,300
Hey!

407
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,060
What did you do? Get out.

408
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,620
"How cruel are you murderer? How
you broke my heart, oh, oh."

409
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:38,180
"How cruel are you murderer? How
you broke my heart, oh, oh."

410
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,900
"I keep saying cruel."
"I say, I say..."

411
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,780
"I kept saying, my heart is cruel."

412
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:52,060
"My heart is,
my heart is, my heart is..."

413
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:57,340
"Oh heart keeps coming here."
"Oh heart keeps coming here."

414
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,700
"It is hard to count."

415
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,860
"Recognise yours... Recognise...

416
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,380
which heart is yours
among these hearts?"

417
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,620
"Which is your heart?"
"Which is your heart?"

418
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:34,300
"Take all these hearts,
keep it on your foot."

419
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,660
"Take all these hearts,
keep it on your foot."

420
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:46,940
"You tell them all
the name of girls."

421
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:56,340
"Who yearn, yearn, yearn, yearn."

422
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:02,780
"Who yearn on your name,
guess that's..."

423
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,180
"my heart. That is my heart."

424
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,420
"Which heart is it?"

425
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,420
"No."

426
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,660
"Oh, my mother."

427
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,940
"Your poor heart, roam around."

428
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:45,980
"Your poor heart, roam around."

429
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:53,660
"I do not want your yearning heart."

430
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,460
"Listen."

431
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:04,460
"Listen, taker him. Listen,
taker him, he is rogue."

432
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:10,020
"Your heart it is.
Your heart it is."

433
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:31,460
"Fall in love with someone."

434
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:36,180
"Fall in love with someone."

435
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:43,500
"My heart is the leader of all, try
to do election." - "Will see."

436
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:47,900
"Let's go."

437
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:52,460
"Wait, wait, wait..."

438
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:59,820
"Let's take vote
and see which heart is best."

439
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,300
"My heart it is. My heart it is."
- "Your heart it is?"

440
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,500
"My heart it is. My heart it is."
- "Your heart it is?"

441
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:17,500
Asha, remember that night in Kashmir
when you rejected my love.

442
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,900
I sat under your room all night.

443
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,460
With the hope that
you'll believe in my words.

444
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,660
My whole body was numb
from the cold.

445
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,340
Then I fell unconscious.

446
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,440
When I opened my eyes,
I found myself in the hospital.

447
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,400
Raj. - I searched
for you whole day and night.

448
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,640
Asha, if you don't
believe my love...

449
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,000
then go to those valleys where
everything will witness my love.

450
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,600
You will see your name everywhere.

451
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,280
The name which has become
an important part of my life.

452
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,480
Hoping that at some point of life
you will pass from here.

453
00:35:06,462 --> 00:35:08,862
And by chance
your eyes will fall on your name.

454
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,040
So maybe you will recall
that someone was crazy...

455
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:16,080
whose love you rejected.

456
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:17,972
That's all, Rajan.

457
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,040
I got my punishment for hurting you.

458
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,680
I came far away rejecting
your love...

459
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,000
but I couldn't forgot about you.

460
00:35:31,332 --> 00:35:34,452
The indecisiveness of heart
and mind took away my sleep.

461
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,100
Away from you I realised...

462
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,840
that I love you.

463
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,000
I used to cry for you.

464
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,200
Asha.

465
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,960
Rajan. Asha.

466
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,080
I'll not talk to you.

467
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,120
Wow, the pot calling
the kettle black.

468
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,760
Neither anyone is pot nor kettle.

469
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,720
I am waiting for half an hour.

470
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,560
You are lying.
I am waiting here for an hour.

471
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,080
One hour?

472
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,840
You?
- You?

473
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,480
Who are you?
- Who are you?

474
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,600
I mistook you as Jyoti.

475
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,960
I mistook you as Deepak.

476
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,080
Sorry, sister.

477
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,560
Sorry, brother.

478
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,400
Sister, can I get your address?

479
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,080
You are calling me your sister...

480
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,520
and asking for address
at the same time?

481
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,920
If I'll not have the address
how can I come at 'Rakhi'?

482
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,600
Madanpura Simit Chal.

483
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,160
This is near to my house.

484
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,040
My address is Chauki
Mohalla Grass lane.

485
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,320
Okay, sister.
- Okay, brother.

486
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,920
Bye-bye.

487
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,320
Jyoti.

488
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,800
Sorry.

489
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,520
No need to say sorry.

490
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,720
What do you do?

491
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,360
Bansi.

492
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,760
Don't you feel ashamed of
talking to another woman?

493
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,120
Jyoti.
- Shut up.

494
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,160
Jyoti.

495
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,500
Jyoti.

496
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,380
Jyoti, what should I do?

497
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,060
I see your face in every face.

498
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,260
Your beautiful eyes...

499
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,540
your soft cheeks...

500
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,620
you little nose...

501
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,500
and...

502
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,220
My Bansi.

503
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,660
Yes, dear.

504
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,260
I always miss your face.

505
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,780
Have you ever eaten 'Pakoda'?

506
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,060
'Pakode'? Yes.

507
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,740
This nose of yours...

508
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,220
your cheeks...

509
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,780
and this eyes.

510
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:23,273
I miss them all.

511
00:38:23,346 --> 00:38:25,786
That means, I am very handsome.

512
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,540
No, you aren't.

513
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,460
Stop this nonsense and listen to me.

514
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,780
Yes. - You have to meet
my father tomorrow.

515
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,940
I'll not meet your father.

516
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,340
Then I'll also not meet you.

517
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,040
Mom, where are you?

518
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,440
What happened? Mom, look who's here?

519
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,640
Who?

520
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,360
Hello.

521
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,120
Hello.

522
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,800
Are you Asha?

523
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,200
Isn't it?

524
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,240
Yes.

525
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,920
Oh! so she is the one...

526
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,200
for whom my son used to be so upset.

527
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,240
Did not sleep whole night.

528
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,080
Mom, don't say in front of her.

529
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,680
Otherwise she'll be on cloud nine.

530
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,880
Why not? She is
the Goddess Laxmi of our house.

531
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,320
You'll stay happy only
if you'll pamper her.

532
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,560
Oh, God!

533
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,160
Okay dear, you sit here.
I'll be back.

534
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,720
Miss. Laxmi, come here.

535
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,280
No.

536
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,720
Oh! you are showing tantrums
from now only.

537
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,480
Okay, I'll come to you myself.

538
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,640
What are you doing?

539
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,040
I'll call aunt.

540
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,560
You don't have to do that,
I'll call her myself.

541
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,520
Dear, put it on.

542
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,560
I was waiting
for this day for long time.

543
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,000
Mother, I'll put it on her.

544
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,680
Okay, take it.

545
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,680
Miss. Laxmi, give me your hand.

546
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,200
Mom, she is so shy in front of you.

547
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,160
I will put it on her finger
at the temple of Goddess Laxmi.

548
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,200
Come, Asha.

549
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,680
Hello uncle.

550
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,880
Come, dear.

551
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,880
How are you now?

552
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,480
I am tired of lying
down on this bed.

553
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,200
It is just for few days
after that you can relax.

554
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,960
I am a heart patient, who knows...

555
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,880
when the heartbeat will stop?

556
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,240
Prakash, I want to say something.

557
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,480
Yes.

558
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,680
Dear, I want you to marry Asha.

559
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,640
Uncle, you're making me
feel embarrassed.

560
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,120
You have already done
a lot of favors to me.

561
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,440
Does anyone do a favor to his own?

562
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,760
Dear, you are the son of my friend.

563
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,080
It is my duty to take care of you.

564
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,280
I always considered
your father's respect as my own.

565
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,600
I have faith in you.

566
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,320
That's why I want to marry
my daughter with you...

567
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
I want to feel relieved.

568
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,720
I don't know if
I am worth it or not.

569
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,560
But I promise you,
I'll keep Asha happy.

570
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,440
Prakash, you gave me relief.

571
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,120
Dad. Hello Prakash.
- Hello.

572
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,480
Dear, you are late.

573
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,640
I am sorry, dad.

574
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,280
I got late at Madhu's house.

575
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,760
Okay, go and have dinner.

576
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,280
Okay. Let's go Prakash.

577
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,480
Okay, uncle.
I'll come again tomorrow.

578
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,280
Bye, uncle.
- God bless you, dear.

579
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,400
Madam, I have kept
the food on table.

580
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,800
Asha, I am leaving.

581
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,320
First have some food.

582
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,080
No, Asha.
- I'll not listen to you.

583
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,360
You have to eat with me.
Please, Prakash, come on.

584
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,680
Come on.

585
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,920
Thank you.

586
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,360
You go.

587
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,680
Wow!

588
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,160
Take this.
- Hey! that's it.

589
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,120
Take this 'Paratha.'

590
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,960
No, that's it. - What are you
doing? Aren't you hungry?

591
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,360
What else should I serve you?

592
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
What are you looking at?

593
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,960
You seem to be so happy today.

594
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,240
Yes, Prakash. I am so happy today.

595
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,320
Today, I have taken
the biggest decision of my life.

596
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,160
What?

597
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
Won't you tell me?

598
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,760
I want to say it.

599
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,440
If I'll not tell you then whom?

600
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,520
Because you are the one who...

601
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,160
I feel shy.

602
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,920
Please, tell me.

603
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,680
Not today. Some other day.

604
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,680
I'll wait for that day.

605
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,280
I have waited too.

606
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,640
My friends...

607
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,560
my sisters...

608
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,160
make me so perfect in love...

609
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,320
that Jyoti should not have
any complains.

610
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,960
Okay then tell us
whatever we taught you.

611
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,160
Okay, I'll tell.

612
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,040
Your eyes are so beautiful!

613
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,760
Wow! your nose is so cute.

614
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,720
Wow, your silky hair.

615
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,320
You are my love.

616
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,600
You are my darling.

617
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,920
Bansi. What is this?

618
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,160
What happened?

619
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,280
If this is
the situation before marriage...

620
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,880
what will you do after marriage?

621
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,560
After marriage, I'll do nothing.

622
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,920
I was doing all this
for your benefit.

623
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,080
What's my benefit?

624
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,400
Jyoti, I don't know how to love?

625
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,840
I was just learning.

626
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,960
Am I not there?

627
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,080
Ever since we have met...

628
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,440
have you ever talked with love?

629
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,360
Have you?

630
00:44:24,424 --> 00:44:25,504
Have you ever given a chance?

631
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,560
OK, let's talk.

632
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,600
What to talk?

633
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,600
You are angry.

634
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:36,800
Bansi.

635
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:39,920
Yes, dear.

636
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,360
Bansi.

637
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,160
Yes, dear.

638
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,760
Bansi.

639
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,080
Yes, dear.

640
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,080
What is this?

641
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,440
Why is your nose flickering?

642
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,440
Oh God!

643
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,360
You ruined my mood.

644
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,640
This is my style to love.

645
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,320
I don't know why my nose flickers
while making love.

646
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,240
Yuck!

647
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:32,600
"I am falling in love with you."

648
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,640
"I am falling in love with you."

649
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:48,840
"Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!"

650
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:56,040
"My heart started to
agree with you."

651
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:03,000
"My heart started to
agree with you."

652
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:12,400
"Darling, darling."
"Darling, darling."

653
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,600
"I am going crazy."

654
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:41,360
"My eyes have told your stories."

655
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,880
"I am going crazy."

656
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,160
"My eyes have told your stories."

657
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,960
"Your love
and loyalty did the magic...

658
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,080
even the butterflies are in love."

659
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,080
"My heart called."

660
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,680
"My heart called."

661
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,200
"What? What? What?"

662
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:15,120
"I am falling in love with you."

663
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,400
"Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!"

664
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,360
"Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!"

665
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,520
"Give me your foot step...

666
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:53,880
since when
I have been waiting in your way."

667
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,520
"Give me your foot step...

668
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:02,240
since when
I have been waiting in your way."

669
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:10,160
"How will I say my heart is yearning
to come in your arms."

670
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,800
"My heart called."

671
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,320
"My heart called."

672
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,840
"What? What? What?"

673
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:27,480
"My heart started to
agree with you."

674
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:32,080
"Darling, darling."

675
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,640
"Darling, darling."

676
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,000
"When loneliness surrounds
my heart...

677
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:05,080
then I came to know that
I love you."

678
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,600
"When loneliness surrounds
my heart...

679
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,920
then I came to know that
I love you."

680
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,200
"We are in falling in love...

681
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,000
with each other then tell me
when we are getting married?"

682
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:26,600
"My heart called."

683
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,600
"My heart called."

684
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:38,280
"I am falling in love with you."

685
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:47,520
"Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!"

686
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:54,200
"My heart started to
agree with you."

687
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:03,920
"Darling, darling. Darling,
darling. Darling, darling."

688
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,220
Doctor, can I come in?

689
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,340
Rajan.

690
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,740
You.

691
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:28,860
Are you alright?

692
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:32,420
Why? Is only patients allowed
in your clinic?

693
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,460
Here friends
and patients both are allowed.

694
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,780
But you are one of those friends
who meet once in a year. - Okay.

695
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,460
And what about the day
I came to your party?

696
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,700
That's strange.

697
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,100
How come you came today?

698
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,500
According to me you should
have come after an year.

699
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,340
I don't accuse you.

700
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,500
How can you spare some time...

701
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,060
from your girlfriend
to meet your friend?

702
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,180
Tell me, who are you in love with?

703
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,620
Prakash, that Rajan is changed.

704
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,820
I love someone.

705
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,980
You fell in love with
every beautiful girl.

706
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:03,620
No, dear.

707
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:08,140
For the first time I have understood
the pain of the love.

708
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,860
I wish you had also loved someone.

709
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,740
Ask this heart, since when it
has been waiting for someone.

710
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,220
Really?

711
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,940
Prakash, who is she?

712
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:25,100
Rajan, you'll be surprised.

713
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,500
Even after
I know that she loves me...

714
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,140
I never confessed my
feelings to her.

715
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,740
You lost here.

716
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,220
See that before you express
your love to her...

717
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,260
she becomes someone else's.

718
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,540
Friend, we should not wait
in case of love.

719
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,580
No, Rajan.

720
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,060
I trust my love.

721
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,580
My love can't betray me.

722
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,220
Hello, Prakash.

723
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,140
Hello.

724
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,261
Asha, I...

725
00:51:54,341 --> 00:51:56,920
Don't talk to me. I was waiting
for last 30 minutes.

726
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,980
And you don't care.

727
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,180
I am very sorry, Asha.

728
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,860
I'll never repeat.

729
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,860
Then let's go.
We can still watch movie.

730
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,140
Yes, Bansi
and Jyoti are also going with us.

731
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,060
Let's go. I am sorry, Prakash.

732
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,140
I am taking your friend with me.

733
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,220
Asha, you go.
I'll be there in a moment.

734
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,100
Okay, come quickly.
- Yes.

735
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,500
Wow, man...

736
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,620
I am very impressed.

737
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,940
You won her heart
in just one meeting?

738
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,180
What do you mean?

739
00:52:29,132 --> 00:52:31,492
What do you think,
that I met Asha in your party?

740
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,520
No, my friend.

741
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,540
I met Asha first time in Kashmir.

742
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,980
And it was love at first sight.

743
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,900
To be honest, Asha taught me
the true meaning of love.

744
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:49,940
And I realised that love is
the most beautiful reality of life.

745
00:52:50,106 --> 00:52:54,226
Rajan, as a friend,
I never asked you for anything...

746
00:52:56,026 --> 00:52:57,666
but I am asking you today...

747
00:52:58,051 --> 00:53:01,651
You have no idea, this house has
done a lot of favor to me.

748
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,180
And you know well,
Asha is so innocent.

749
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:12,460
Don't cheat her ever.
Please keep her happy.

750
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,100
This will be a favor on me.

751
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:22,060
Prakash, you will not trust
my loyalty if I say...

752
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:25,420
you will know it at right time.

753
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,380
Go, someone is waiting for you.

754
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,340
Uncle.
- What's the matter, son?

755
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:02,340
Uncle, I can't marry Asha
as per your wish.

756
00:54:03,144 --> 00:54:04,064
Prakash.

757
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,500
I am sorry.

758
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,340
What happened, dear?

759
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,260
Asha loves someone else.

760
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:13,940
Love?

761
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,740
Who is he?

762
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,860
Rajan. I know him.

763
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,820
He is my friend
and belongs to a good family.

764
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,340
I can assure you...

765
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,780
Asha will be very happy with him.

766
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,980
But, Prakash...

767
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:31,660
I...

768
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,860
If Asha is happy it makes me happy.

769
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:40,300
You haven't talked to Asha
about me. Have you?

770
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,420
I was about to talk to her today.

771
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,780
Uncle, do not let Asha
know about this.

772
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:50,980
She'll feel bad.

773
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,060
I'm leaving.

774
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:06,460
Prakash.
- Prakash, I am so happy.

775
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,860
I feel like
the whole universe is in my favor.

776
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,580
Asha made my life beautiful.

777
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,820
It was you, who helped me
to get my love back.

778
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,580
Now you'll not have any complaints
that I don't see you.

779
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,140
You are really selfish.

780
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,460
Will you only come for Asha?

781
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,980
You are selfish too.

782
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,980
You know everything about us.

783
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,100
But you didn't tell anything
about your love.

784
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:31,940
What about her?

785
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,900
There is only sadness in my fate.

786
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:42,980
Prakash.

787
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:49,780
You were right, one should never
wait in the matter of love.

788
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,300
She loves someone else.

789
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,220
How do you know?

790
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,300
I can see it in her eyes.

791
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,740
May be you have a misunderstanding.

792
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,020
No, Rajan.

793
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:06,940
After betrayal I realised...

794
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,260
that time doesn't wait for anyone.

795
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,180
Who threw this garbage?

796
00:56:26,372 --> 00:56:27,412
Who's there?

797
00:56:32,311 --> 00:56:35,951
There is a silver spoon
in this garbage.

798
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,220
This is my spoon.

799
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,780
Oh, when I was asking about garbage,
you were not responding.

800
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,300
And as soon as you heard
about spoon, you came.

801
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,220
Come down.

802
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,620
Sorry.

803
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:51,140
Can't you see me?
Do you consider me a dustbin?

804
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,140
Come here.

805
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,740
I am sorry.

806
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,500
Come here. I'll not spare you.

807
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,620
Okay, I am coming.

808
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,220
Hey, come.

809
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,830
Why did you called me downstairs?

810
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,860
My bad. I had only seen
your face from here...

811
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,860
not your body.

812
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,940
You can go back.
My anger cooled down.

813
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,260
Why will I go back?

814
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,540
Why? Hey, talk with manners.

815
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,380
Don't use your hands.

816
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,100
My anger is very bad.
I'll not spare you.

817
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,300
You'll hit me? Oh, God!

818
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,620
Hey! Don't hit me.

819
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,980
Look, I'll call cops.

820
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,740
I'll call them
and you'll get such a beating...

821
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,740
that you'll call
your mother out of pain. - Shut up.

822
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,140
Why are you beating me?

823
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,580
He is hitting me.

824
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,700
He hit me really.

825
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:53,140
I will go and complain to my mother
that this bastard hit me.

826
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,580
Wait, stop there.

827
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,220
Asha, so sorry.

828
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,020
I can't make it today.

829
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,540
Yes, with Bansi.

830
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,660
Bansi.

831
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,860
What happened to you?

832
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,900
There was a serious fight...

833
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,220
I teach him a lesson.

834
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,420
Whom?

835
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,220
My enemy, he was thinking
himself a don.

836
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,100
I also taught him
a lesson by beating him.

837
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,060
Well, you know Jyoti...

838
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,940
that I don't raise my hands
on weak person.

839
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,500
But he was not agreeing.

840
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,320
Then I got angry
and I slapped him hard.

841
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,320
And again I hit him.

842
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,840
And again...
- That's it.

843
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,160
I understood.
- No, you didn't.

844
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,560
And at the last I swindled him
like an airplane.

845
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,800
And threw him.

846
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,720
And then I counted, 1... 2... 10...
and he fell unconscious.

847
00:58:51,189 --> 00:58:53,622
I wish my father had
seen your bravery.

848
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,800
I can show that at any time.

849
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,680
Where is your father?

850
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,680
Why aren't you satisfied from
what happened earlier?

851
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:01,720
Who are you?
- Dad.

852
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,160
Dad.
- Dad.

853
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,800
So he is your Bansi?

854
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,440
You can't marry him.
- No, dad.

855
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,640
Please don't break my heart.
I am sorry.

856
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,560
Dad, forgive him.

857
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,240
Not at all. He is a coward.

858
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,840
Get up.
- Dad.

859
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,000
Dad, look...

860
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,520
I knew that you are Jyoti's dad.

861
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,520
So how can I fight with you?

862
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,240
If you want to know about
my strength...

863
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,720
then you can test me.

864
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,720
Then lift the weight.
- Okay.

865
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,360
Lifted.

866
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,680
Not her, I asked you
to lift the weight.

867
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,360
Weight, oh okay. Oh, God...

868
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,640
give me strength.

869
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,640
Come on.

870
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,520
Come.

871
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,080
I can lift it.

872
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,560
I did it.

873
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,560
You have guts.

874
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,880
Isn't is?

875
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,240
Now, tell me when can
I come to marry?

876
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,000
I'll feed the procession...

877
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,360
but who'll feed Jyoti?

878
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,600
I mean, what do you do?

879
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,920
I play flute.

880
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,320
And love others.

881
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,800
'Keep lighting the light with
the light." - Shut up.

882
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,840
Listen careful,
until you find a job...

883
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,520
you are not going to get Jyoti.
Understood? - Yes.

884
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,720
Yes, I got it.

885
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,560
Couldn't happen.

886
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,560
Couldn't happen again.

887
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,360
What are you thinking?

888
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,880
Asha, do you know,
Prakash also loves someone?

889
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,080
Not possible. You must have
had some misunderstanding.

890
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,560
You told me himself about it.

891
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,720
And you'll feel bad after hearing...

892
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,160
that the girl loves someone else.

893
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,800
Who could she be?

894
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,800
Asha, do you know
any girl known to Prakash?

895
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:08,160
Prakash loves someone
and I don't know?

896
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,160
From childhood till date
he has not hidden anything from me.

897
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,200
There's a lot of difference between
childhood and youth.

898
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:21,160
Asha, I feel sorry for Prakash.

899
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,200
He was so sad.

900
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:30,080
I'll go to him today. He needs me.

901
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,600
Who will support him other than me?

902
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,280
Who will understand his grief?

903
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,440
Prakash.

904
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,680
Asha.

905
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,320
Come.

906
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,280
I came here to fight with you.

907
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,520
You are angry with me?

908
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,640
I never expected from you that
you'll hide something from me.

909
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:55,840
What?

910
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,160
About your love.

911
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,440
What if I complain you
about the same?

912
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,960
Many times
I wanted to tell you about Rajan.

913
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,160
But don't know, could not tell you.

914
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:17,760
Do you remember, I told you
that I will tell you later?

915
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,560
And I said that
I will wait for that day.

916
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,440
Now, I have no complaints.

917
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:28,840
But I have.

918
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:31,044
Who is she?

919
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:32,720
Asha, please.

920
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,480
I don't want to recall her.

921
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:39,000
May be you misunderstood her.

922
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,880
I misunderstand her.

923
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,200
I feel sorry for that girl...

924
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,760
who lost your love.

925
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,120
How unlucky she is!

926
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,680
I am unlucky.

927
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,320
She got her love.

928
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:11,720
Prakash.

929
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,960
"The way I am laughing after
swallowing the tears of my sorrow."

930
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,720
"No one else can do this."

931
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:31,900
Hey!

932
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,660
What?

933
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:48,610
What?

934
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,100
I am saying you to eat these sweets.

935
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:00,060
And pack what's left.

936
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,940
We will eat tomorrow.

937
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,740
I don't want it.
I am not hungry like you.

938
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:07,500
He always asks to eat
at other's parties.

939
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:13,540
But never said, Jyoti, come on,
I'll take you to Taj.

940
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:18,060
Jyoti, hotel's food is not healthy.

941
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:22,900
And there's no discrimination
in my heart.

942
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,340
I consider other's place as mine.

943
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,100
And my house is already mine.

944
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,620
Keep this sweets with you.
We'll eat it tomorrow.

945
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,980
I don't want this.
- Hey!

946
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:43,500
Dear, meeting you,
gave me peace of mind.

947
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,060
Dear, I am really happy today.

948
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,220
Happy birthday, Asha.

949
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,140
Thank you, Madhu.

950
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,580
Hello, uncle.
- God bless you dear.

951
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:53,500
Hello, Madhu.
- Hello.

952
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,260
Prakash hasn't come yet?

953
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:56,900
He might be busy with patients.

954
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:00,100
Okay dear, I'll take some rest.

955
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:01,540
No, dad. You can't go.

956
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,420
Dear, this is your party.

957
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:06,180
Madhu and Rajan is already here
and Prakash might be on his way.

958
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,540
There's no use of me.

959
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:08,660
Okay.

960
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,540
Rajan, I'll go.

961
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,980
Where are you going?

962
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:15,780
Who will look after the guests?

963
01:05:18,677 --> 01:05:20,214
You are looking really pretty.

964
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:23,460
Prakash.

965
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,740
May you live 1000 years.

966
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,860
And each year will have 50000 days.

967
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,540
That's it?

968
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:39,860
Where is my gift?

969
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:41,580
Gift?

970
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:45,420
Asha, I had kept the gift for
a long time.

971
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,900
I thought I would surprise you.

972
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,500
But it's strange...

973
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:53,740
I lost the gift.

974
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,020
You have the gift, Prakash.

975
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:00,100
Your voice. You can surprise
not only Asha but everybody.

976
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,940
No, Rajan, I cannot sing today.

977
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,060
If not today, then when?

978
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:06,940
Please, Prakash, for me.

979
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,380
You swear on your lover.

980
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,620
Click her picture and keep it here.

981
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,220
Nothing can be better gift.

982
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:12,060
"If time used to be faithful..."
"If time used to be faithful..."

983
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:17,260
"you would have been mine."

984
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:26,100
"Like everyone else I also..."
"Like everyone else I also..."

985
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:31,420
"would be loved by you."

986
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:35,340
"If time used to be faithful..."

987
01:07:52,460 --> 01:08:01,900
"There is already some sorrow
in my destiny."

988
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:11,340
"There is already some sorrow
in my destiny."

989
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:20,860
"And some loyalty is also less
in your nature."

990
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:29,980
"Otherwise I would have not lost
the game I won."

991
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:39,300
"If time used to be faithful,
you would have been mine."

992
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:43,460
"If time used to be faithful."

993
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:07,860
"I could not even tell my partner
that I am also thirsty"

994
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:17,420
"I could not even tell my partner
that I am also thirsty"

995
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:26,620
"There was glass in front
and I could not even take that."

996
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:36,020
"I wish I had not been betrayed."

997
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:45,300
"If time used to be faithful,
you would have been mine."

998
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:49,580
"If time used to be faithful."

999
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:16,260
"I am suffocating still I am alive."

1000
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:25,460
"I am suffocating still I am alive."

1001
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:34,980
"I am ashamed of my life."

1002
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:44,340
"I would have died if I would have
been dependent on memories."

1003
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:53,780
"If time used to be faithful,
you would have been mine."

1004
01:10:53,860 --> 01:11:02,340
"Like everyone else I also..."
"Like everyone else I also..."

1005
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:07,660
"you would love me."

1006
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:12,820
"If time used to be faithful."

1007
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:36,460
Prakash.

1008
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:45,474
You and the guest probably
didn't like my gift.

1009
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:48,185
I am sorry.

1010
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:04,700
Asha, that day the girl...

1011
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:06,820
Prakash is
in love with had come to the party.

1012
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:12,580
I appreciate that he made a picture
of his love with his voice.

1013
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:14,820
And I came to know.

1014
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,580
Rajan, why didn't you
show me the girl?

1015
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,980
At that time, I did not considered
it appropriate.

1016
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:24,260
Don't worry. You know that girl.

1017
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,140
Who is she? Is she Madhu?

1018
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:31,780
You.

1019
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,860
Rajan, you are very doubtful...

1020
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:39,980
and jealous too.

1021
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:41,940
How can you say that...

1022
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:44,380
the girl he loves is not you?

1023
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,380
Because I know Prakash very well.

1024
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:50,740
If he loved me, he would definitely
tell me about his heart.

1025
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,260
When you doubted on him...

1026
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,460
then I want to say something.

1027
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,140
Before you came in my life...

1028
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,300
if he had expressed his love...

1029
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:05,500
then maybe you would
not come in my life.

1030
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:07,740
If Prakash would have been
in your life...

1031
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:09,660
then would you be very happy?

1032
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:11,100
I would be sad.

1033
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:14,020
Rajan, the place and respect...

1034
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:17,980
I have fore Prakash is
way more than my love.

1035
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,740
Maybe you will not understand this.

1036
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,740
I want to look
at Prakash with the same respect...

1037
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,180
not as my lover.

1038
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:28,500
This is my wish.

1039
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,260
Asha, I am sorry.

1040
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,420
I misunderstood the relationship
of yours and Prakash.

1041
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:42,220
What are you thinking?

1042
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:44,325
Nothing.

1043
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,640
I just thinking...

1044
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,240
If you don't mind,
can I ask something?

1045
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,160
Yes.

1046
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,520
Will you tell me the truth?

1047
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:56,640
Yes.

1048
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,120
Do you love me?

1049
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,320
Asha.

1050
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,560
Sorry, Prakash.

1051
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,880
But Rajan is doubtful
that you love me.

1052
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,960
Do you feel the same?

1053
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,360
No.

1054
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,600
I can never think wrong about you.

1055
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,240
Rajan could not understand the
relationship between you and me.

1056
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,920
I feel sorry for that.

1057
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,120
I respect you more than my love.

1058
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,960
This feeling is support of my life.

1059
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,200
I told this to Rajan also.

1060
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,400
Asha, what if Rajan is right?

1061
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,560
I would feel very sad.

1062
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,200
My vision would have been shattered.

1063
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,560
I will never let that happen.

1064
01:14:55,216 --> 01:14:56,920
I respect your feeling.

1065
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,640
What is your name?

1066
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:06,560
Rusi.

1067
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:07,600
Who Rusi?

1068
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,800
Rusi, I mean Russia.

1069
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,040
What's your name?

1070
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,760
I got it.

1071
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,960
Rusi Bandukwala.

1072
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,960
Okay.
- What's your father's name?

1073
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,080
Mr Rastam.

1074
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,080
What's Rastam's father's name?
- Mr Patau.

1075
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,000
What is Mr Patau's father's name?
- Mr Palam.

1076
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,160
And I don't know
the name of Mr Palam's father.

1077
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,240
Have you got any award for a song?

1078
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,720
Yes, Golden Jubilee.

1079
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:29,960
Golden Jubilee?

1080
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,480
I have worked at fifty places during
the Golden Jubilee.

1081
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,160
Tell me the name.
- Yes, I am telling the names.

1082
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,160
Laila's messy hair.

1083
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,640
Majnu's tears.

1084
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:40,800
Farhad's heart with the work.

1085
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,040
That's it.

1086
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,120
Show me your acting.
- Okay.

1087
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,200
My dear Jyoti...

1088
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,080
you are my love.

1089
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,600
I love you.

1090
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,960
I can't show you
that by tearing heart...

1091
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,320
but I can show by tearing my coat.

1092
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,760
How true is my love!

1093
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,080
Enough, leave me.

1094
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:05,160
Hey!
- Sorry.

1095
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,960
Sorry. Wait.

1096
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:08,880
Have your seat.

1097
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,240
Your seat.

1098
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:12,880
Sir, I got this...

1099
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:13,920
Hello.
- Yes.

1100
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,760
Bansi, you?

1101
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,640
Hey, is he Bansi?
- Yes.

1102
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:21,200
You lied to me. Get out of here.

1103
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,360
Hey take him out.

1104
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,680
Get him out.
- No, wait.

1105
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,560
I'll go on my own.

1106
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:28,720
Thank you.

1107
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,160
Okay, shall I go.
- Yes.

1108
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,080
Get out.

1109
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,960
Get out.

1110
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,120
Get out.
- Sorry.

1111
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,320
You also go.

1112
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,240
Go after him.

1113
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:43,100
But dear, why do you need
to go abroad for studies?

1114
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:45,980
You are already successful.

1115
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:49,420
Dad's last wish I should get my
degree from Oxford University.

1116
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:52,660
I consider it my duty
to fulfill his wish.

1117
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:55,020
Well done, dear. You go.

1118
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:58,220
May God bless you with success.

1119
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:00,140
And it's just a matter of 1 year.

1120
01:17:00,693 --> 01:17:01,973
Till then Asha will also
become a doctor.

1121
01:17:02,582 --> 01:17:04,182
Yes, it is right.

1122
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:34,580
What are you looking at?

1123
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,740
You.

1124
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:43,460
Rajan, how will
I live 1 year without you?

1125
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,820
Why are you thinking this?

1126
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:48,980
Darling, we have 1 month left.

1127
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:50,780
Come on, let's dance.

1128
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:07,220
Prakash, do you remember...

1129
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:10,660
you introduced me to Asha in
the same place a year ago?

1130
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:15,860
I thought you are so innocent.

1131
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:20,140
You couldn't even realised from our
face that we have already met.

1132
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,460
Rajan, I am not so smart like you.

1133
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:24,580
Why would I doubt?

1134
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:29,020
What kind of love is that
which can be expressed on face?

1135
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:32,860
Anyone can see your face
and tell about your feeling.

1136
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:34,980
really?

1137
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:38,140
Okay, how are you going to abroad?

1138
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,180
What do you mean?

1139
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:41,660
I mean, by plane, by car...

1140
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:44,660
by steamer,
by motorcycle, cycle, horse car?

1141
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,580
How can I go on horse car?

1142
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:50,140
I am going by plane.

1143
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,060
If you want to enjoy
the journey then go by steamer.

1144
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,260
You'll be able to see many
more cities along the way.

1145
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:56,460
Wonderful idea.

1146
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,540
What say, Asha?

1147
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:05,860
Asha, I am very happy today.

1148
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:09,260
How good it had been...

1149
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:13,140
if Prakash's love would also
have been with him!

1150
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:17,340
I feel sorry for Prakash.

1151
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:21,060
Such a big house, loneliness...

1152
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,020
but I'll not let this happen.

1153
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:27,620
Rajan, after you come back, you'll
see his life partner with him.

1154
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,540
I'll change his life...

1155
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:32,020
that you'll be shocked.

1156
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:37,260
Asha, promise that Prakash will
not be alone when I return.

1157
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:38,660
Yes.

1158
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:42,060
That's it, now I am tired.

1159
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:43,180
No, one more dance.

1160
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,180
Okay, sure. Not with me...

1161
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:47,580
but Prakash.

1162
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:48,820
Come on.

1163
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:52,140
Come on. Why don't you dance?

1164
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,700
Maybe you don't know
that Asha dances very well.

1165
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:56,420
No, Rajan.

1166
01:19:56,740 --> 01:20:00,580
Let me see.
I love watching both you dancing.

1167
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:04,140
Sometimes I feel,
you should ask me for something.

1168
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:06,460
Today, you ask something from me.

1169
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,660
If I ask, can you give?

1170
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:12,900
Ask me.

1171
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,740
You'll be shocked.

1172
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,660
You are panicking as if
I am asking for your life.

1173
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:22,860
I was just kidding.

1174
01:20:23,676 --> 01:20:26,326
Do I have to ask from you?

1175
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,140
I have the right
on everything you have.

1176
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,260
What say, Asha?

1177
01:20:42,766 --> 01:20:45,486
Dear, how long will you ship reach?

1178
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,380
It will take almost 15 days.

1179
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,320
Dear, tale your garland.

1180
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,240
Mother, you keep this with you.

1181
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:58,120
Asha, will you forget your mother
after Rajan's departure?

1182
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,000
This is not possible, aunt.

1183
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:02,160
Take care of mother and Asha.

1184
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,880
Sure.

1185
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,520
Go, dear.

1186
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,040
Take care of yourself.

1187
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,720
We will be restless
till your return.

1188
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:28,840
Prakash.

1189
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:30,680
Mother.

1190
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,120
Hello, uncle.

1191
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,680
Uncle, hello.

1192
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,400
Prakash, come.

1193
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,960
How are you?

1194
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,520
Dear, I am fine.

1195
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,520
Please try to explain
my crazy daughter.

1196
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,440
What happened?

1197
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,360
She didn't had her
dinner last night.

1198
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,880
Now when I called for breakfast
she is saying her head is hurting.

1199
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,320
She is furious on everyone.

1200
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,080
Isn't this craziness?

1201
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,880
She have to spent
a year without Rajan.

1202
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,240
Go and make her understand.

1203
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,640
Take her somewhere out so that
she feels better.

1204
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:21,920
Go dear.

1205
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:24,880
Okay.

1206
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,240
You came again.

1207
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,720
Hit me again.

1208
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,560
Maybe your anger will cool down.

1209
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,120
I am sorry, Prakash.
I thought... - Okay.

1210
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,240
You have made your this condition
in one day separation?

1211
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,880
How will you live
for 1 year without Rajan?

1212
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,360
I am not feeling well.

1213
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,280
How will you feel good in
a closed room?

1214
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,280
Go and get ready. We are going out.

1215
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,960
No, Prakash. I am not feeling good.

1216
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,120
Are you not coming?

1217
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,120
No?

1218
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,760
No. No?

1219
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,040
Okay, I'll go. Leave my ears.

1220
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,560
Okay, get ready.
I am waiting downstairs.

1221
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,320
What are you thinking?

1222
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:23,680
Are you missing Rajan?

1223
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:25,680
No.

1224
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,880
I was thinking about you.

1225
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:32,160
Prakash, will you listen to me?

1226
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,840
I know what are you going to ask.

1227
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:38,320
With someone else I... Isn't it?

1228
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:39,680
Yes, Prakash.

1229
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,640
You'll get tired alone in
the journey of life.

1230
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,920
Without a life partner...

1231
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,240
life feels like a burden.

1232
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,560
What if you lost your love?

1233
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,800
Someone else will bring
love into your life.

1234
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,480
And your life will be full of joy.

1235
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,760
And you'll start loving your life.

1236
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,440
How do you know that
I don't love my life?

1237
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,840
Your grief and your feelings...

1238
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,400
how can I not understand?

1239
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,960
I wish you could understand.

1240
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:12,760
No, Asha.

1241
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,760
I cannot even think
about someone else.

1242
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,640
Let's go.

1243
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:23,680
It's getting late.

1244
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:40,840
Hello.

1245
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,440
Hello.

1246
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:43,920
Come, have a seat.

1247
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:44,960
Thank you.

1248
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,280
What's your name?

1249
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:52,640
My name is SIDT Swamy.

1250
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,920
Why have you come here?

1251
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,560
For your job.

1252
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,640
You had given an advertisement...

1253
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:02,280
that your daughter wants
to learn sing and dance.

1254
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,720
Yes, for my daughter.

1255
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,120
Yes, I am a teacher.

1256
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:09,120
Okay, which ragas do you know?

1257
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,280
I know a lot of ragas.

1258
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,280
I know Pawamanipu Raga.

1259
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,920
I know Naedimalli Raga.

1260
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,680
I know Haritalmattum Godimaharaj.

1261
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,600
You have knowledge about
great ragas. - Yes.

1262
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,720
Okay, then sing a raga for me.

1263
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,800
Okay.

1264
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,680
(Other language)

1265
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,360
(Other language)

1266
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,680
(Other language)

1267
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:51,680
(Other language)

1268
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,960
Hey, wait.
- Yes, sir.

1269
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,840
Lower your volume.
This is my office.

1270
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:57,920
I am sorry, sir.

1271
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,480
I was lost in singing.

1272
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,440
Okay. You are hired.

1273
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,360
Thank you, sir.

1274
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,680
Take this card and visit my
house tomorrow morning.

1275
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,600
I'll introduce you to my daughter.

1276
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,920
Daughter?
- Yes, for teaching song.

1277
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,520
Song? Yes.

1278
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:15,720
Mr Subramaniam.

1279
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:17,720
You are going to come...

1280
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:19,520
You?

1281
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:20,880
What happened?

1282
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,680
Do you know him?
- Yes.

1283
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:23,840
You have no idea...

1284
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,680
this man is a fraud.

1285
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,560
He only scams.

1286
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:30,320
I'll not spare you.

1287
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,040
He is my daughter's teacher.
I called him at my house.

1288
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,160
He'll run away with my daughter.

1289
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,840
Go and call the cops.

1290
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,560
If anyone does this, he should
be handed over to the police.

1291
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:42,960
Yes, of course.

1292
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:44,400
I'll go and call the police.

1293
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:45,560
You guys wait here.

1294
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,000
Go quickly.
- Yes, go.

1295
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:49,720
Will you become the witness?
- Yes.

1296
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:50,640
Oh God!

1297
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,720
He went to call the police now whom
will we hand over to the police?

1298
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:05,760
Hello, dad.

1299
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,120
Dad, you are always busy
reading newspaper.

1300
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:16,920
Dad!

1301
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,480
Dad.

1302
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,640
But isn't this possible
that some people...

1303
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:00,480
Yes, please.

1304
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,840
Regarding Nilkamal.

1305
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:04,640
Sorry, sir.

1306
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:06,480
No sir.

1307
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:10,800
I am very sorry, Mr Prakash.

1308
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,280
Thank you.

1309
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,960
No one can do anything.

1310
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,160
Yes, dear.

1311
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,240
Even mothers can't do anything
against God's wish.

1312
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,040
But Asha...

1313
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:50,440
I am going to her.

1314
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,240
May God give us
the strength to bear this sorrow.

1315
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,320
Rajan.

1316
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:25,280
Where are you going?

1317
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,480
I don't know.

1318
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:34,520
I'll tell you.

1319
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,680
Do you know, why I have come here?

1320
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,840
The way you were looking
at the sleeping pills...

1321
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,960
and talking to Madhu about death.

1322
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,800
You are torturing yourself.

1323
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:50,040
And now you want to hurt us
more by committing suicide.

1324
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:53,720
Yes, I want to commit suicide.
I don't want to live.

1325
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,360
What do I live for?

1326
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:56,280
Asha.

1327
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,920
Get out of my way.

1328
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,520
Who are you to stop me?

1329
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:16,080
Prakash, this misery is
not bearable for me.

1330
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:21,120
God has done so wrong to me.

1331
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:25,680
Dad's voice echoes
in my ears again and again.

1332
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:29,320
I always miss Rajan.

1333
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,280
I feel as if
he is calling me for help.

1334
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,360
This loneliness haunts me.

1335
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,240
And I feel suffocating.

1336
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,040
I feel like,
I should do something to myself.

1337
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,320
My head is hurting.

1338
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:48,520
What should I do?

1339
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,720
Asha, I can feel you.

1340
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:56,800
If every person starts committing
suicide to get rid of sorrow...

1341
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,640
then what will be left
for the person?

1342
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,680
Life is a gift of God.

1343
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:07,400
You can't end your life like this.

1344
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:12,920
And you have a aim in your life.

1345
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,360
You are going to become a doctor.

1346
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:16,920
You can establish a hospital.

1347
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:21,120
By giving free treatments to poor
and helpless patients...

1348
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:25,520
you can forget
your sorrow and grief.

1349
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,200
Asha, everyone lives
for themselves...

1350
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,000
you live...

1351
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,720
for those helpless people
who needs you.

1352
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:38,520
This can give you a new life.

1353
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,240
And I have faith...

1354
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:46,600
that one day you'll feel
the need of yourself.

1355
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,840
You have a very bright
future Dr Prakash.

1356
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:30,760
Thank you, sir.

1357
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:32,960
Mr Prakash.
- Bansi.

1358
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,520
Can you give me
a job in this hospital?

1359
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,760
Bansi, what will you do
in this hospital?

1360
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,000
I will give vitamin M to patients.

1361
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,800
Vitamin M? Yes, Vitamin M
which means entertainment.

1362
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,320
Entertainment for patients.

1363
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:47,040
There is no happiness in this world
other than happiness, Prakash.

1364
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,880
But Bansi...
- No but and if, Miss. Asha.

1365
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:52,200
If I'll not get this job,
I can't marry Jyoti.

1366
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:55,480
And if I'll not Jyoti,
I can't bear this.

1367
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,040
And if...

1368
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,480
if...
- Okay.

1369
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,560
So can I join from tomorrow?
- Yes.

1370
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,800
Then, I am happy.

1371
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,000
I am happy.

1372
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:09,600
I am happy.

1373
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:14,240
Sorry, deduct
it's money from my salary.

1374
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,600
I am happy.

1375
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,320
I am happy.

1376
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:20,760
How many times have
I told you to wear nice clothes.

1377
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,200
I am ashamed to go with you.

1378
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:26,120
I feel ashamed to go with you.

1379
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:30,040
I mean, Jyoti
why you pay attention on clothes.

1380
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,720
Just focus on my heart.
You used to call me stingy...

1381
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:36,560
look, today I spent Rs 8. 12...

1382
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,680
and bought this ring...

1383
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:39,960
for our engagement.

1384
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,520
You keep this ring with you.

1385
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:43,520
And listen carefully.
- Yes.

1386
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:48,240
I will not marry you until
you do your makeover.

1387
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:49,680
Did you get it?

1388
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:16,640
"Oh don't go in attitude,
don't go like this."

1389
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:21,200
"Oh don't go in attitude,
don't go like this."

1390
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:25,720
"The intention of passers
by will change."

1391
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,160
"You are so beautiful,
just after looking..."

1392
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:34,720
"no one gets burnt in jealousy."

1393
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,040
"Oh don't go in attitude."

1394
01:35:56,720 --> 01:36:01,320
"These days you have
a lot of pride."

1395
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:05,720
"These days you have
a lot of pride."

1396
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:10,400
"You are young
and God is also kind on you,"

1397
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:16,720
"If I got crazy,
what's so strange about it?"

1398
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:21,120
"What happened to
the person who spoiled you?"

1399
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:25,320
"I love your tyrannical attitude,
innocent face."

1400
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:32,040
"Oh don't go in attitude,
don't go like this."

1401
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:36,440
"The intention of passers
by will change."

1402
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:39,520
"Oh don't go in attitude,
don't go like this."

1403
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:02,880
"Alcohol is a little nectar
and a little poison."

1404
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:07,240
"Alcohol is a little nectar
and a little poison."

1405
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:12,200
"When they are mixed,
your beauty is made."

1406
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:18,080
"The respect of the people
of the city is in danger."

1407
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:22,640
"Oh my, darling,
my life is in danger."

1408
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,640
"I love your tyrannical attitude,
innocent face."

1409
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:33,080
"Oh don't go in attitude,
don't go like this."

1410
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:37,600
"The intention of passers
by will change."

1411
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:40,440
"Oh don't go in attitude."

1412
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,440
My mother called me...

1413
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:48,480
and I am here. Come dear.

1414
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:49,720
Have a seat.

1415
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,320
How is Asha?

1416
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,520
Mother, your Asha is very magical.

1417
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,520
Every patients she treats...

1418
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:57,520
gets cured.

1419
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,040
Prakash, I want to say something.

1420
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:07,120
Have you ever thought about Asha?

1421
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,640
I didn't get.

1422
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:16,120
She has become lifeless.

1423
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,560
She is serving people all day...

1424
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,280
just to run away from her sorrow.

1425
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:24,360
But for how long?

1426
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:25,520
I know, mother.

1427
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,120
But what can I do?

1428
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,840
You can change her life...

1429
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,760
by becoming his life partner.

1430
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,880
Mother, you know everything.
Still you are saying this.

1431
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:43,120
You are also aware of everything.

1432
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:45,520
Her sorrow.

1433
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,840
And who else other
than you can understand her?

1434
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,640
Don't you want Asha to be happy?

1435
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,720
Mother, I can do anything
to see her happy.

1436
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,080
My happiness lies in her happiness.

1437
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,040
But would Asha...

1438
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:03,920
Asha can't refuse her mother.

1439
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,320
Hello, aunt.
- Asha.

1440
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,920
Come, you remembered
your mother today.

1441
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:16,080
Okay, mother.
I have some work in hospital, I go.

1442
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:19,200
Okay.

1443
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:22,440
Asha, come and sit.

1444
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:26,720
I want to say something.

1445
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,600
Mother, I know everything.

1446
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,040
I can't even think of it.

1447
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:39,120
Asha, life of a woman is incomplete
without a life partner.

1448
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:41,800
What if life partner is separated?

1449
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,520
Life doesn't end.

1450
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:46,240
You have to live.

1451
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:48,400
No, mother.

1452
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,440
I can't do this.

1453
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:54,320
Without love,
one's heart is always incomplete.

1454
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:56,440
Your heart needs love.

1455
01:39:57,880 --> 01:39:58,720
Love!

1456
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,000
It is not in my fate.

1457
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:06,560
Dear, what about Prakash?

1458
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,480
Don't associate him with me, mother.

1459
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:14,880
Asha, he is the one
who can take away all your sorrows.

1460
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,840
His happiness lies in
your happiness.

1461
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:17,800
Mother.

1462
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:18,960
Please, think.

1463
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:27,120
I'll think about it.

1464
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:43,360
Did mother told you
about me anything?

1465
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:46,280
Yes, the same thing she told you.

1466
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:51,480
You tell me Prakash,
what should I say to mother?

1467
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:57,280
Asha, maybe
I can't give you the love...

1468
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:02,040
the happiness
that you ever wished for.

1469
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,720
But yes, I'll always try
to understand you.

1470
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:10,320
Seeing you happy...

1471
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:13,840
is the desire of my life.

1472
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:16,840
Do you remember...

1473
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:24,560
that one day I was also
at the same point of life as yours.

1474
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:31,440
And you said, that
I'll get tired alone in this life.

1475
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:35,360
What if you lost your love?

1476
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:41,520
Again someone will come with love
in your life.

1477
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,480
And you'll get your happiness.

1478
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:52,920
And you also said that life feels
like burden without love.

1479
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:59,880
Asha, mother loves us.

1480
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,040
That's why, she wants this.

1481
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:08,240
Still, if you are not happy with
the decision...

1482
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:10,960
then you can say.

1483
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:14,560
I'll make mother understand.

1484
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:18,480
Whatever mother said...

1485
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:24,320
is right.

1486
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,880
Do you remember,
one day you asked...

1487
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:46,080
about your gift?

1488
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,600
That time I had nothing more
than my sorrow.

1489
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:54,400
Today it's your birthday.

1490
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,240
But you didn't asked me for gift.

1491
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:17,880
Asha, this is not a gift.

1492
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:20,560
It is my soul.

1493
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:24,560
This is all the feelings of my heart
that I am presenting to you.

1494
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,920
You'll definitely miss
the passed time.

1495
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,360
That memories is unforgettable.

1496
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,600
That is the part of our lives.

1497
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:49,920
Whenever these moments comes...

1498
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,120
I'll try to understand
your feelings.

1499
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,640
My love will never hurt you.

1500
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:02,480
Prakash.
- Yes, Asha, I promise you.

1501
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,040
Rajan's ring is irreplaceable.

1502
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,280
I'll never try to remove the
memories of Rajan from your heart.

1503
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:17,880
Today I want to share
a secret with you.

1504
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:22,360
Maybe I would not tell you
in my whole life.

1505
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,960
Because I knew that it'll hurt you.

1506
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:30,160
But this is true Asha.

1507
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:33,520
You are my love.

1508
01:44:37,080 --> 01:44:38,760
Rajan was right.

1509
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:45,400
I never expressed my love.

1510
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:48,960
And I have always adored you.

1511
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:52,200
Even after knowing...

1512
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:56,360
that you love Rajan.

1513
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:58,360
Prakash.

1514
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:01,960
Asha, I am sorry.

1515
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,640
I broke your trust.

1516
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:07,360
No, Prakash.

1517
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:09,640
My trust is not broken.

1518
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:14,320
Today, your respect has
increased in my heart.

1519
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:20,680
In that point of life
where you are alone...

1520
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:23,920
I'll support you.

1521
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:34,160
Isn't my daughter beautiful?

1522
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:37,720
Mother.

1523
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:38,960
No.

1524
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:41,280
I am very happy.

1525
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,360
My wish has been fulfilled.

1526
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:46,520
Aunt.

1527
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:48,960
Please fulfill my wish as well.

1528
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,920
Please pay attention in my life.

1529
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:56,400
Until when I'll be single?

1530
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:57,640
Hey!

1531
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:21,760
Doctor, Rajan.

1532
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,040
Do you know him?

1533
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:23,920
He...

1534
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:25,920
How does this happen?
How is the case?

1535
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:28,360
He met an car accident
outside the hospital.

1536
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,400
He is out of danger.

1537
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:31,640
But he lost a lot of blood.

1538
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:33,880
Taking him to the special room.

1539
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:35,920
I'll be there.

1540
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,320
No, Asha.

1541
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,800
Asha, please.

1542
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:47,640
Be brave.

1543
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:56,320
Excuse me, doctor.

1544
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:58,600
I want to handle Rajan's case.

1545
01:46:58,880 --> 01:46:59,720
If you don't mind.

1546
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:01,200
Not at all, Dr Prakash.

1547
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:02,320
Thank you.

1548
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:03,880
I'll go for a change.

1549
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:36,320
Prakash.

1550
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:43,160
Where is my ring?

1551
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:46,040
With me.

1552
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:47,880
Prakash.

1553
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:52,200
Asha, it was all fortune
that brought us to engagement.

1554
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:55,720
I don't believe in such bondage.

1555
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:00,680
The bond is of heart
and emotions not about the time.

1556
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:07,720
You are free.

1557
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:12,800
Asha, I never came in
the way of your happiness...

1558
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:14,800
nor will I ever come.

1559
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:20,720
My happiness lies in your happiness.

1560
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:49,200
Being a mother...

1561
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:53,240
my tears roll down when I miss him.

1562
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:58,600
I don't know why
I feel that Rajan is not dead.

1563
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,960
He'll come back.

1564
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:05,240
You are giving false
hopes, isn't it?

1565
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,360
You can't see tears
in mother's eyes.

1566
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,600
I am not giving false hopes, mother.

1567
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,240
I got to know that some people
survived in that ship.

1568
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,120
I feel like Rajan also survived.

1569
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,320
You are joking with your mother?

1570
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:33,120
If he would have survived...

1571
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:37,480
he would not have made me
cry for three years like this.

1572
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:40,000
Mother, he is back.

1573
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:41,520
Prakash.

1574
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:44,400
Mother, our Rajan is back.

1575
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:46,120
Our Rajan is back, mother.

1576
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:47,160
Rajan is back?

1577
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,640
Rajan is alive?

1578
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:49,600
Yes, mother.

1579
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,560
Where is he?

1580
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:53,120
Where is he?

1581
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:55,640
Mother, he is in the hospital.

1582
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:56,960
Hospital?

1583
01:49:58,440 --> 01:49:59,640
He met an accident.

1584
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:02,600
He has lost his memory.

1585
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:03,920
He lost his memory?

1586
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:06,680
No need to worry, mother.
He will be fine soon.

1587
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:08,840
Prakash, take me to him.

1588
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:10,040
Come.

1589
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:38,560
Rajan.

1590
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:42,560
She is your mother.

1591
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:52,200
Why are you crying?

1592
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:53,120
No...

1593
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,520
I am very happy.

1594
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:58,640
I got back my son.

1595
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:03,280
What happened, son?

1596
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:04,560
Tell me, dear.

1597
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,800
I am not feeling good.

1598
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:08,800
I am with you.

1599
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:20,840
Mother.

1600
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:22,880
Let him sleep.

1601
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:26,360
Come.

1602
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:53,520
What are you thinking, mother?

1603
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:57,800
I am thinking, son...

1604
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:00,800
my Rajan is back...

1605
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,920
now what about my Prakash and Asha?

1606
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:06,520
What, mother?

1607
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:08,600
Everything will be fine.

1608
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:11,840
Asha and Rajan will get married.

1609
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:18,360
And your Prakash will enjoy
in their wedding.

1610
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:21,400
Mother, Asha will be the bride...

1611
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:24,240
and Rajan will bring
the wedding procession.

1612
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:29,080
I can't come
in wedding procession...

1613
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:31,320
don't mind.

1614
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:37,440
I have to bid farewell to Asha.

1615
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:40,920
Except me...

1616
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:43,960
who will be with her?

1617
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:45,680
Son.

1618
01:52:47,575 --> 01:52:48,495
God bless you, son.

1619
01:52:50,308 --> 01:52:52,428
You are so kind.

1620
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:01,220
You are still a child.

1621
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:03,220
Mother.
- Yes.

1622
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:06,580
Why do you worry?

1623
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:09,300
There's nothing to worry, dear.

1624
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:12,460
What can make me
happy other than this?

1625
01:53:14,642 --> 01:53:15,620
I am fine.

1626
01:53:17,540 --> 01:53:18,980
Take me home.

1627
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:20,940
You want to go back home?

1628
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:24,780
Okay, I'll ask Prakash.

1629
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:28,620
Take this medicine.

1630
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:31,180
Now I'll see patient 9 again.

1631
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:33,060
Prakash.
- Mother.

1632
01:53:34,060 --> 01:53:35,860
Dear, Rajan wants to go back home.

1633
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:37,180
Better.

1634
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:40,660
Don't try to remind Rajan
of old things.

1635
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:45,060
He should have any problem
that affects his condition.

1636
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:46,780
Okay.

1637
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:54,740
2... 4... 2... 9... 4... 5... Jyoti.

1638
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:57,260
Jyoti, there's a news good for you.

1639
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:59,860
Yes, I mean the good news.

1640
01:54:00,973 --> 01:54:04,013
In the hospital, all
those ward boy working here...

1641
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:06,540
I have become
the president of their union.

1642
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:09,740
Just get sick
and come to the hospital quickly.

1643
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,580
Then you'll see the,
my vitamin M is more affective...

1644
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:14,220
than any doctor's medicine.

1645
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:15,340
Hello.
- Wait a minute.

1646
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:18,260
Jyoti, darling,
if you can't fall sick...

1647
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:21,140
then your harsh father...

1648
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:23,180
send that idiot here.

1649
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:25,460
So that I can fix him.

1650
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:28,740
What? Hey!

1651
01:54:28,860 --> 01:54:30,740
We are waiting for so long
and you are avoiding us.

1652
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:33,860
Jyoti, darling.

1653
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:37,580
An elephant has escaped from
a Kamla circus.

1654
01:54:38,020 --> 01:54:39,140
I'll call you later.

1655
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:43,260
Who told you my name?

1656
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:44,700
My name is Kamla.

1657
01:54:45,580 --> 01:54:46,660
What has happened to you?

1658
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:47,540
Donation.

1659
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:49,180
Donation is the name of sickness.

1660
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:51,900
Hey! I am not sick.

1661
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:54,580
I have come here to give donation.
- Donation for what?

1662
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:57,820
Hey! Shut up.

1663
01:54:57,980 --> 01:54:59,660
(Other language)

1664
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:21,220
I am tired.

1665
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:25,820
Asha, we have so far from
our destination.

1666
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:28,860
Now in order to reach...

1667
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:31,740
the destination we have to cover
the same distance.

1668
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:33,860
Isn't it?

1669
01:55:34,860 --> 01:55:35,700
Yes, Rajan.

1670
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:40,180
This is the distance between us
and destination.

1671
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:49,140
Look at this, Rajan.

1672
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:54,100
Here it is...

1673
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:57,100
there too.

1674
01:55:58,540 --> 01:55:59,460
It is everywhere.

1675
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:05,420
Do you remember, Rajan?
You wrote my name here?

1676
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:06,860
You told yourself.

1677
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:13,500
Me?

1678
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:15,420
Yes, Rajan. Do you remember?

1679
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:16,860
Please, try and recall.

1680
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:18,900
No, Asha.

1681
01:56:20,620 --> 01:56:21,420
I don't remember anything.

1682
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:26,740
I am feeling dizzy.

1683
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:30,060
I am feeling dizzy.

1684
01:57:12,820 --> 01:57:17,900
"I swore, a night came, my dear."

1685
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:25,460
"You also wanted to be
someone... to be..."

1686
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:30,740
"Now everyday comes from there..."

1687
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:38,500
"the sound of someone crying."

1688
01:57:38,580 --> 01:57:41,540
"I swear, it came..."

1689
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:21,700
"When I miss you,
spring becomes restless."

1690
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:32,260
"When I miss you,
spring becomes restless."

1691
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:42,540
"Like me in
this season raining clouds cry."

1692
01:58:42,620 --> 01:58:47,820
"Says morning, you'll meet..."

1693
01:58:47,900 --> 01:58:55,580
"this night is to cry together."

1694
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:58,980
"I swear, it came..."

1695
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:43,940
"I asked for blessings
but got some pain and loneliness."

1696
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:53,940
"I asked for blessings
but got some pain and loneliness."

1697
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:59,580
"Despite being near, you are far."

1698
01:59:59,660 --> 02:00:04,660
"The meeting clarinet cries."

1699
02:00:04,740 --> 02:00:09,820
"It remained
the desire of this heart..."

1700
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:17,420
"for the fulfillment of desires."

1701
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:30,220
"You also swore one night
for being someone."

1702
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:42,860
"Now everyday comes from there
the sound of someone crying."

1703
02:00:42,940 --> 02:00:45,740
"You swore..."

1704
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:50,380
What do you think about it?

1705
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:53,260
I am not sure.

1706
02:00:57,220 --> 02:00:59,700
There's one way, by which
he can get back his lost memory.

1707
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:03,460
But there is also
the fear of one thing.

1708
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:04,820
What?

1709
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:07,660
Rajan was away for 3 years.

1710
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:11,940
We don't know what happened in
that time with him.

1711
02:01:13,260 --> 02:01:14,900
Maybe something had happened...

1712
02:01:16,020 --> 02:01:18,460
after knowing
which you can lose him again.

1713
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:25,060
I feel like,
we should know about that.

1714
02:01:26,300 --> 02:01:28,340
Where was Rajan in
these three years?

1715
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:29,740
What happened?

1716
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:32,900
And as far as losing him
is concerned...

1717
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:35,980
it is my fate.

1718
02:01:37,940 --> 02:01:39,580
Prakash, I want my love.

1719
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:41,300
Not a statue.

1720
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:44,060
To whom I have to tell about
our relationship.

1721
02:01:46,660 --> 02:01:48,540
We have to repeat that car accident.

1722
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:50,740
I am sure this shock...

1723
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:54,300
of fake accident will definitely
bring back Rajan's memory.

1724
02:01:55,460 --> 02:01:56,300
I'll drive the car.

1725
02:01:59,580 --> 02:02:01,340
Do you think, I'll kill Rajan?

1726
02:02:01,900 --> 02:02:02,940
Sorry, Prakash.

1727
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:06,460
I really thought this for a moment.

1728
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:09,060
I am ashamed...

1729
02:02:10,020 --> 02:02:11,740
that I thought this about you.

1730
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:13,460
The person...
- It is not your fault.

1731
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:15,140
You are tensed.

1732
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:18,620
Asha, we will not tell
mother about this.

1733
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:21,180
But we will take her permission...

1734
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:23,180
that Rajan will stay with us.

1735
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:08,740
Prakash, what did you do?

1736
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:10,580
I was not wrong.

1737
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:11,460
What are you saying, Asha?

1738
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:12,380
Nothing has happened to him.

1739
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:14,060
Did you see
the fear on Rajan's face?

1740
02:03:14,580 --> 02:03:15,420
I am sure, Asha, that...

1741
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:17,700
this incident will help Rajan
in recalling his memory.

1742
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:19,380
Dr, Sharma, take him.

1743
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:46,860
Look Rajan.

1744
02:03:48,700 --> 02:03:49,540
Who is here?

1745
02:03:52,940 --> 02:03:53,780
Rajan.

1746
02:03:56,580 --> 02:03:57,900
I am not Rajan.

1747
02:04:06,580 --> 02:04:07,380
Who are you?

1748
02:04:07,860 --> 02:04:09,980
Rajan, do have any idea,
what are you saying?

1749
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:13,460
Look, try to recognise.

1750
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:16,220
I am your friend, Prakash.

1751
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:17,900
Look at Asha.

1752
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:20,100
Your love...
- You guys are misunderstanding me.

1753
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:22,060
I am not Rajan...

1754
02:04:23,260 --> 02:04:24,100
but Ramesh.

1755
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:26,900
I can recall.

1756
02:04:28,220 --> 02:04:29,060
That car...

1757
02:04:30,700 --> 02:04:31,660
accident...

1758
02:04:34,780 --> 02:04:36,180
bright light.

1759
02:04:37,900 --> 02:04:39,580
The darkness in front of my eyes.

1760
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:42,100
This hospital.

1761
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:45,060
For how long have I been here?

1762
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:56,300
For how long have I been here?

1763
02:04:56,860 --> 02:04:57,700
3 months.

1764
02:04:58,420 --> 02:04:59,260
3 months!

1765
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:00,940
Oh God!

1766
02:05:02,380 --> 02:05:03,900
My mother must be waiting for me.

1767
02:05:04,700 --> 02:05:08,020
My sister...
what must they be thinking?

1768
02:05:08,860 --> 02:05:12,940
What if... No,
I want to go back home.

1769
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:14,700
I will go back home.

1770
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:17,460
Please, lie down.

1771
02:05:18,700 --> 02:05:20,020
I promise...

1772
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:22,420
you'll go back to
your house tomorrow morning.

1773
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:24,420
Trust me.

1774
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:48,180
Asha.

1775
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:50,340
Asha.

1776
02:05:52,340 --> 02:05:53,180
Asha.

1777
02:05:56,300 --> 02:05:57,140
Asha.

1778
02:06:00,860 --> 02:06:01,700
Asha.

1779
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:16,740
You are feeling ashamed of calling
me your mother, isn't it?

1780
02:06:17,660 --> 02:06:19,620
Look, you are mistaking me.

1781
02:06:20,460 --> 02:06:21,520
I am not that who...

1782
02:06:21,622 --> 02:06:23,662
You can deceive Asha and Prakash...

1783
02:06:24,941 --> 02:06:26,220
not your mother.

1784
02:06:27,060 --> 02:06:29,180
I know, why are you
doing this, Rajan.

1785
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:30,660
I told you that I am not Rajan.

1786
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:36,060
Look in my eyes.

1787
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:38,060
Now say that you are not Rajan.

1788
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:40,740
Say that I am not your mother.

1789
02:06:40,860 --> 02:06:42,100
Yes, I am not Rajan but Ramesh.

1790
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:43,340
Swear on me.

1791
02:06:43,580 --> 02:06:45,340
Swear on me and say...

1792
02:06:45,820 --> 02:06:47,180
that I am not your mother.

1793
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:48,540
Am I not your mother?

1794
02:06:49,220 --> 02:06:50,060
Say.

1795
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:51,940
Mother.

1796
02:06:57,580 --> 02:06:59,700
Yes, mother. I am your Rajan.

1797
02:07:00,340 --> 02:07:03,620
I don't know how
I survived the accident.

1798
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:06,620
When I realised that I am alive...

1799
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:09,260
it was too late.

1800
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:13,020
My friend and love had changed.

1801
02:07:14,860 --> 02:07:16,220
The day I came back...

1802
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:38,140
'Isn't my daughter beautiful?'

1803
02:07:41,580 --> 02:07:42,540
'Mother.'

1804
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:49,820
'I am very happy.
Today my wish got fulfilled.'

1805
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:05,780
I could not bear it.
I wanted to go away from here.

1806
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:07,580
I wanted to run away from myself.

1807
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:10,140
I was dead for all of you.

1808
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:12,300
I wanted to die. No.

1809
02:08:13,140 --> 02:08:16,060
I kept on running
and I got hit by a car.

1810
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:19,620
After that I lost my memory.

1811
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:23,220
When I woke up I saw Prakash
and Asha in front of me.

1812
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:26,100
My fate brought me
back in the same situation.

1813
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:30,300
I don't want to come
in between Asha and Prakash.

1814
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:33,820
That's why, mother. I changed
my name from Rajan to Ramesh.

1815
02:08:35,820 --> 02:08:38,740
Didn't you think before
changing your name...

1816
02:08:39,260 --> 02:08:41,580
that how will your mother survive?

1817
02:08:41,900 --> 02:08:44,180
How will you stay away from us?

1818
02:08:44,460 --> 02:08:46,340
How was you living when
I was not here?

1819
02:08:47,140 --> 02:08:48,660
Asha and Prakash was your own.

1820
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:54,060
Is there difference between me
and Prakash in your eyes?

1821
02:08:54,660 --> 02:08:56,020
Speak up, mother.

1822
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:00,300
This is right.

1823
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:03,540
I'll go away from their lives.

1824
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:09,980
Rajan, don't you care about
your helpless mother?

1825
02:09:10,820 --> 02:09:13,580
You want me to live with
pain and sorrow?

1826
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:18,220
I won't let you go.

1827
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:20,860
I'll tell everything
to Asha and Prakash.

1828
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:22,900
Don't do this, mother.

1829
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:26,260
You have to support your son for
the happiness of Asha and Prakash.

1830
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:27,260
No, Rajan.

1831
02:09:27,380 --> 02:09:29,220
Mother, you swear on me.

1832
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:34,220
If you'll not listen to me,
I'll die. - No.

1833
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:39,820
Before someone listen to us,
go away, mother.

1834
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:44,380
No.

1835
02:09:59,940 --> 02:10:00,740
Prakash.

1836
02:10:03,820 --> 02:10:07,460
Well done.
I expected this from you, Rajan.

1837
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:11,420
You want to go away from
Asha and my life.

1838
02:10:12,260 --> 02:10:14,820
Why? Just because we are engaged?

1839
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:19,100
But did you even try to know
why did this happened?

1840
02:10:20,940 --> 02:10:23,060
You could not bear this?

1841
02:10:23,860 --> 02:10:26,740
And what hasn't she suffered
for you, my friend?

1842
02:10:27,180 --> 02:10:29,020
You could never imagine.

1843
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:32,740
The oppression you have done
on Asha by becoming Ramesh...

1844
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:34,740
I'll never forgive you for that.

1845
02:10:37,060 --> 02:10:39,860
Rajan, she ate poison
because of you.

1846
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:45,820
Prakash. - Yes,
mother, Asha ate poison.

1847
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:48,900
No, this can't happen.

1848
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:52,180
Prakash, please say
that Asha is safe.

1849
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:53,420
Say, Prakash.

1850
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:54,340
Asha will be safe.

1851
02:10:55,220 --> 02:10:56,220
Asha will be safe.

1852
02:10:56,860 --> 02:11:01,060
Rajan, Asha only loves you.

1853
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:05,260
I am sorry, Prakash.
I had a misunderstanding.

1854
02:11:05,980 --> 02:11:08,660
Where is Asha? Take me to her.

1855
02:11:11,980 --> 02:11:14,020
Hi, what did you say?

1856
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:16,740
Don't talk to me about Bansi.

1857
02:11:17,140 --> 02:11:18,420
Otherwise I'll hang up.

1858
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:28,780
Jyoti, ever
since you got angry with me...

1859
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:32,380
my eyesight is getting weaker.

1860
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:35,220
You are lying again.
Don't talk to me.

1861
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:38,660
Jyoti, don't say this.

1862
02:11:38,980 --> 02:11:41,660
Otherwise I'll go crazy
just like Romeo.

1863
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:44,980
The people of your neighbourhood
will laugh at me.

1864
02:11:45,380 --> 02:11:48,380
And your dogs will bark at me.

1865
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:53,700
Yuck!

1866
02:11:57,660 --> 02:11:59,820
Okay, I am sorry.

1867
02:12:04,060 --> 02:12:05,460
Sorry.

1868
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:08,340
Okay, listen,
I'll give you a good news.

1869
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:12,780
Dad has agreed.

1870
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:16,900
Am I dreaming?

1871
02:12:16,980 --> 02:12:18,620
No, this is true.

1872
02:12:18,700 --> 02:12:21,380
Where is that great personality?

1873
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:23,100
Where is his feet?

1874
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:26,260
Here it is.

1875
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:27,380
Yes.

1876
02:12:27,860 --> 02:12:30,380
Who says heaven lies only in
the feet of mother...

1877
02:12:30,460 --> 02:12:31,820
What are you doing?

1878
02:12:31,940 --> 02:12:36,460
I say that heaven lies in
the feet of father-in-law.

1879
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:38,340
Isn't it?
- Yes.

1880
02:12:38,980 --> 02:12:41,180
Help me to get up.

1881
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:43,380
Okay, get up.
- Yes.

1882
02:12:44,620 --> 02:12:47,220
Have your seat.

1883
02:12:48,100 --> 02:12:50,140
Father-in-law, I have an idea.

1884
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:51,420
What idea?

1885
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:53,380
You also come.

1886
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:58,300
Father-in-law, Rajan
and Asha is getting married soon.

1887
02:12:58,580 --> 02:13:01,140
Why not both of us get married in
the same wedding alter?

1888
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:03,580
Not a single penny will be spent.
Even the alter is free.

1889
02:13:03,660 --> 02:13:04,557
Alter is free?
- Yes...

1890
02:13:04,637 --> 02:13:06,500
no penny will be spent
and the alter is free as well.

1891
02:13:06,580 --> 02:13:10,700
Isn't Jyoti your daughter?
- Yes.

1892
02:13:10,780 --> 02:13:12,940
You just buy 15 piece 'Suit'
and 'Sari' for her...

1893
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:15,060
and 25 piece suit for me.

1894
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:16,740
Not a single penny will be spent.

1895
02:13:16,820 --> 02:13:20,380
Alter is free.
- Yes, alter is free.

1896
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:21,500
Buy me a motor.

1897
02:13:21,580 --> 02:13:23,580
Motor?
- I mean a bike.

1898
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:27,220
I will take your daughter on
a trip on that bike.

1899
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:29,580
No penny will be spent
and the alter is free as well.

1900
02:13:29,660 --> 02:13:31,740
Isn't it, no penny is spent.
- Yes, alter is free.

1901
02:13:31,820 --> 02:13:32,660
What say, father-in-law?

1902
02:13:33,980 --> 02:13:37,260
You make all the arrangements
and I'll do the rest.

1903
02:13:41,140 --> 02:13:44,220
No penny will be spent
and he told the cost of Rs 10000.

1904
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:46,780
But dad, alter is free.

1905
02:13:46,860 --> 02:13:48,100
Yes, it is.

1906
02:13:48,180 --> 02:13:50,340
Alter is free.

1907
02:13:50,900 --> 02:14:01,660
"My heart called. What,
what, what?"

1908
02:14:01,740 --> 02:14:08,260
"I am falling in love with you."

1909
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:17,260
"Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!"
