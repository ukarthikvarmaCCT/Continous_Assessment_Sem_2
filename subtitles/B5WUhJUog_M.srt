1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,808
- Chris, can I borrow your phone?

2
00:00:01,808 --> 00:00:02,641
- Yeah, sure.

3
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:03,474
You need to text somebody.

4
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:04,307
Oh, you dropped it.

5
00:00:04,307 --> 00:00:05,140
- Yes.

6
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:05,973
And notice how it's okay?

7
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:06,806
- Yeah, it's fine.

8
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:08,587
- But what if we dropped
it from a hundred feet?

9
00:00:08,587 --> 00:00:09,494
- Let's not.

10
00:00:09,494 --> 00:00:11,549
- Or a thousand feet, or even 10,000 feet?

11
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:13,387
- How are you gonna
drop it from that high?

12
00:00:13,387 --> 00:00:14,820
- We're gonna start things off

13
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,217
by dropping a Mac Mini
onto a Mac from five feet

14
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:18,391
- Mac Attack. Big Mac!

15
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:19,330
- Mac on Mac.

16
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,600
- On the Mac. Mac squared.

17
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,433
- All right.

18
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:24,211
As you can see with the
slow-mo, it crushed the Mac.

19
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:27,634
- I liked not only the
slow-mo, but the 360 cam.

20
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:30,016
- Now we're gonna drop a
watermelon from 15 feet.

21
00:00:30,016 --> 00:00:31,172
- All right.

22
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:34,107
I don't know how we got from
Mac computers to watermelon.

23
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:35,107
- All right, Chris.

24
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:36,379
The watermelon's about to fall.

25
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:37,684
So we just dropped the watermelon and boom

26
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:38,517
- Figure out.

27
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:41,196
And it exploded into like a
million pieces. That was--

28
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:42,029
- A million?

29
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:42,893
I don't think so.

30
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:44,443
- That was more like a hundred thousand.

31
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:45,407
You thought that was cool, right?

32
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:46,285
- Yeah.

33
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:48,398
- Well, here's a car falling
on a car from 50 feet.

34
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:49,664
- Whoa. It squashed it!

35
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,704
- Wow. They have so many different angles.

36
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:53,191
- They do have so many.

37
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:55,190
- What's more impressive
than them lifting up the car

38
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,552
is getting that many cameras.

39
00:00:56,552 --> 00:00:57,783
Now we're gonna drop a car

40
00:00:57,783 --> 00:01:00,037
from 65 feet and see how
high it launches a human.

41
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:01,098
- Wait. A human?

42
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:02,218
- A fake human.

43
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:03,190
- Oh, okay.

44
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,057
Is that Naruto?

45
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:05,128
- Yeah!

46
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:06,183
- It does look like Naruto.

47
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:07,016
- Yo.

48
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:08,269
- Wow. It still hasn't fallen yet. Boom!

49
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,369
- He's so excited.

50
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,619
- I know. I love how happy they get.

51
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:11,738
And speaking of Naruto,

52
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,609
I may have a really special
clap coming up soon. Shh!

53
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:14,682
- Wait, what?

54
00:01:14,682 --> 00:01:17,282
- Now we're gonna throw a piano
off a building from 80 feet.

55
00:01:17,282 --> 00:01:18,365
- I'm ready.

56
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:20,208
- Two, one. Boom.

57
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,649
- Piano!

58
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:24,816
- Bro, if it doesn't make
the do, do, do sound.

59
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:26,444
- Cartoons lied to me.

60
00:01:26,444 --> 00:01:29,681
I'm supposed to hear the sound
of all the keys going ---!

61
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:30,651
- I know.

62
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:32,216
Whoever did the experiment,
thank you for opening our eyes.

63
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:33,049
- Thank you.

64
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:33,915
- Cartoons lie.

65
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:36,108
Now we're gonna drop a
hundred thousand bouncy balls

66
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:36,941
from 85 feet.

67
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:38,888
I love how this is just a how
ridiculous reaction video.

68
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:39,721
- Pretty much.

69
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:40,745
- Oh my gosh.

70
00:01:40,745 --> 00:01:42,305
Give me the side angle.

71
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:43,691
- Whoa, yo.

72
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:45,260
Oh, that's so cool.

73
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,868
Oh and they're seeing
who can catch the most

74
00:01:46,868 --> 00:01:48,011
in remote control cars.

75
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:48,946
- If you guys weren't in Australia,

76
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:50,381
I'd literally be in every video.

77
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:51,329
- Oh, that's right.

78
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,945
We have to fly across the entire world.

79
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:53,901
- Exactly, bro.

80
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:55,536
You could offer me a billion dollars

81
00:01:55,536 --> 00:01:56,525
and I still wouldn't fly to Australia.

82
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:58,243
- Jimmy, I'll give you a billion dollars.

83
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,578
- I'm not flying Australia.

84
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,712
Now we're gonna drop a
PlayStation from a hundred feet.

85
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:02,688
- Wait a minute.

86
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:03,627
- Oh my gosh.

87
00:02:03,627 --> 00:02:06,129
Wait, that's a really cool shot.

88
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:08,019
- I've seen this guy drop an iPhone down.

89
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:08,852
- Woo.

90
00:02:09,918 --> 00:02:11,567
- On the PlayStation5 Guys

91
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:12,626
- Look at that.

92
00:02:12,626 --> 00:02:13,587
That's how you get the skin off of it.

93
00:02:13,587 --> 00:02:14,767
- My male testosterone is spiking.

94
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:15,635
- I'm angry.

95
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,316
I could have eaten that PlayStation 5.

96
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:19,471
Does it still work, is the question?

97
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:20,431
- Nah,

98
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,487
- Ain't no shot.

99
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:22,684
Dropping a sword 120 feet.

100
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,384
Oh, do you think it stabs into the ground?

101
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,388
Like anime style?

102
00:02:25,388 --> 00:02:26,316
- Let's see.

103
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:27,264
The swords falling.

104
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:28,271
It's still falling.

105
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:29,451
Oh!

106
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:30,463
- In the middle!

107
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:31,296
- Oh through paper.

108
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,728
- Wow. That's hard to stab
through that much paper.

109
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:34,648
That's crazy.

110
00:02:34,648 --> 00:02:37,824
That's like, he's coming
from space and he is like...

111
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,378
- Now we're 125 feet up

112
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:41,632
and we're gonna drop an
iPhone covered in concrete.

113
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:42,566
Let's see it.

114
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:44,624
All right, what happens? And boom.

115
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:47,135
- Oh. Oh, they got disintegrated.

116
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:49,447
- The concrete did, did
the iPhone shatter though?

117
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:51,519
- Wow. Look at the metal on this thing!

118
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,064
- Not only is it shattered,
it's like cut into,

119
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:55,123
- Oh, okay.

120
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:56,447
- 'Cause all the rocks.

121
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:58,605
- Dang. Okay, now let's
go ahead and try turning

122
00:02:58,605 --> 00:02:59,730
this thing on.

123
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,863
- Yeah, go ahead. Try it.

124
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:02,175
- No response at all.

125
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:03,138
- Shocker.

126
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:04,367
- Good to know. Good to know.

127
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,356
You do not need a concrete
case to protect your phone.

128
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:08,451
Now we're up to 150 feet.

129
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:09,284
- That's a lot of feet.

130
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:10,626
- All right. It's coming up on the cliff.

131
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:13,102
- Whoa! Oh, those people are close.

132
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:14,862
Oh, that's a giant!

133
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,095
- Yo, look at that shot.

134
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,186
Now we're gonna drop a car on an ax.

135
00:03:18,186 --> 00:03:20,990
- So we saw a sword get
dropped onto something.

136
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,521
Now we're seeing something
get dropped onto an ax.

137
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:24,961
That was a good camera angle.

138
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:26,851
I like that first one, to like tease us.

139
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:27,984
Get us ready for it.

140
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:29,154
And this is the one that just makes us--

141
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:29,987
- Ooh!

142
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,303
Bro. That tower's crazy.

143
00:03:32,303 --> 00:03:33,468
- That's so cool.

144
00:03:33,468 --> 00:03:35,024
Kind of missed a little bit though.

145
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:35,888
- Yeah.

146
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:36,784
- I'm not gonna lie.

147
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:37,708
- Actually just do it again.

148
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,199
All right. Now it's an
airplane versus trampoline

149
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,095
from 200 feet.

150
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,236
- What? Where do they get an
airplane from and a trampoline?

151
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:44,623
You know, they're just
sitting in a big office

152
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:46,945
with a bunch of bean bags and
somebody's like, airplane.

153
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:49,018
And they're like, all right,
what we dropping it on?

154
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:50,080
And somebody's like, trampoline.

155
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,390
And they're like, all right, run it.

156
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,606
- Let's do it tomorrow.

157
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:53,470
- Tomorrow, run it.

158
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,303
- Now we're gonna take a water balloon

159
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:56,111
and drop it from a 300-foot skyscraper.

160
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,664
- Every kid has wanted to do this.

161
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,067
This kid had the balls to do it.

162
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:00,510
- They say if you drop a penny

163
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,238
off the Empire State Building,
it could kill someone.

164
00:04:02,238 --> 00:04:03,071
- Yep.

165
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:04,128
- So what if you drop
a water balloon off it?

166
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:05,099
Let's find out.

167
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:05,932
Holy!

168
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:06,765
- Wow.

169
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:07,598
Okay, good.

170
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:08,665
He's got a second angle.

171
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,146
- That sounded like a rock.

172
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:13,402
- It'd be so fun just to drop
a thousand at the same time.

173
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:14,388
- Oh yeah.

174
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,072
- On Carl, as he is walking by?

175
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:17,559
And then just run away
and never say we did it.

176
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:18,499
I can't wait

177
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:20,377
until we get to the 10,000
foot drop at the end of

178
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:21,210
this video.

179
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,872
That's gonna be insane in the membrane.

180
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:24,578
- Now we're gonna take a
giant rock and drop it.

181
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:25,901
467 feet.

182
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:27,757
- Wait, the wrestler,
Dwayne the Rock Johnson?

183
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:29,681
- You can literally see it on your screen.

184
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:30,722
- Oh my God.

185
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,718
Wait, he's got so many
movies he's gonna be in.

186
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:33,629
Don't do it!

187
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,239
- I refuse to play the
clip until you stop.

188
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,455
- It's a funny joke.

189
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:38,288
- Get him out. Get him outta your system.

190
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:39,402
- Alright, all right.

191
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:41,486
- Jumanji. Action. Bald. Big.

192
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:42,319
- Let's see it.

193
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,214
I wanna see it.

194
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:44,047
- All right. It's falling.

195
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:44,880
It's falling.

196
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,063
Oh my God.
- Still falling.

197
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:47,282
Holy crap.
- Oh my gosh.

198
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:48,115
- Ahh!

199
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:49,039
- Ahh!

200
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,794
- That's it. We're outta here!

201
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:54,769
- This guy is throwing
$10,000 out of an airplane.

202
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:56,133
He's making it rain.

203
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:56,975
- Wait a minute.

204
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:58,018
- So does Honey.

205
00:04:58,018 --> 00:04:59,936
Honey is the number one
shopping tool in America

206
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:02,556
and scours the internet for
coupon codes when you check out

207
00:05:02,556 --> 00:05:04,963
online to make sure you
get the best deal possible.

208
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:05,922
- But wait a minute, Jimmy,

209
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:07,615
this sponsorship couldn't have come

210
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:09,554
at a better time because I
wanted new roller blades.

211
00:05:09,554 --> 00:05:10,734
- That's convenient then.

212
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,798
It's as easy as going to
your favorite online store

213
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:14,639
adding roller blades to your cart

214
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,483
and then watching Honey
search the internet

215
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,433
for coupon codes and then
automatically applying them.

216
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:20,305
- But wait! What if I'm on the go?

217
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:21,888
- I'm glad you asked.

218
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,974
Honey is available on mobile too.

219
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:25,042
- Why am I here?

220
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:26,258
- How much does it cost?

221
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:27,203
- I'm scared.

222
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:28,051
- Tell me!

223
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:28,884
- Shut up!

224
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:29,717
How much my ears hurt.

225
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:30,595
- How much?

226
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:32,079
- How much does it cost?

227
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,912
- How much?!

228
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:34,389
- Nothing, Honey is free to install.

229
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:36,195
- That's !

230
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:40,084
- So go to joinhoney.com/beastreacts

231
00:05:40,084 --> 00:05:42,754
That's joinhoney.com/beastreacts
and install it right now.

232
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:43,859
- Do it!

233
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:46,581
- Now we are in a
helicopter dropping Legos.

234
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:47,779
What's gonna happen?

235
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,400
- Oh, a Lego red arrow.

236
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,249
- Yeah.

237
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,861
- They did this solely for the thumbnail.

238
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:54,174
- Okay, he's dropping it.

239
00:05:54,174 --> 00:05:57,145
- Oh no you fumbled the bag so hard.

240
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:59,104
Fumbled it so hard.

241
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:00,763
- We won't even know what it's
like when it hits the ground.

242
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:01,756
- Oh no.

243
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:03,200
- Even he's like, "Oh, I messed up."

244
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,917
Imagine renting a helicopter
going through all that trouble

245
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:07,369
and then you just hit it on the side.

246
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:10,626
- A whole day's work and
then just ruined instantly.

247
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:13,486
- Yeah, that was still epic.

248
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:14,319
You know what?

249
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,107
I still give it a nine outta 10 for epic.

250
00:06:16,107 --> 00:06:16,940
- I was gonna say eight.

251
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,264
- Now we're gonna drop another car.

252
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:19,618
But from 500 feet.

253
00:06:19,618 --> 00:06:21,177
- This is different 'cause it's higher.

254
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:23,290
This doesn't look like it
was like a planned thing.

255
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,924
It looks like this guy just picked

256
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:26,313
up this car and is gonna drop it.

257
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:28,133
Oh no. Wait. This is Top Gear.

258
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:29,000
I love Top Gear so much.

259
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,375
- I'm not an nerd.

260
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,410
All right. Let's see it fall.

261
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,185
It's still falling.

262
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:37,480
Adds enough time to cut to
other people while it falls.

263
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,418
- It's still going.

264
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:41,894
- Boom. Did that satisfy
your male instinct?

265
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:42,929
- Ooh!

266
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:45,423
- Now we're gonna drop a giant
inflatable ball off a dam

267
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:47,403
into the YouTube employee watching.

268
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:49,525
That's a dam as in the
thing that holds back water?

269
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:50,358
- Oh, I was gonna say...

270
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:51,644
- Not the bad word.

271
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,679
If I see a yellow single
on this video, I will sue.

272
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:54,812
Okay.

273
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:56,990
- I'm so intrigued for
what's gonna happen.

274
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,638
- Imagine he just fell off the,

275
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:00,167
- I was thinking the same
thing 'cause he put a lot

276
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,227
of effort into that.

277
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:03,034
- He was willing to go all in.

278
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:05,834
Imagine he falls off with it, but then he

279
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,239
he's riding the top of it

280
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:09,004
and he bounces up and somehow survives.

281
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:10,522
- He bounces all the way back

282
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:12,779
up to the dam and he is like,
all right, let's do it again.

283
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,748
- Or just bounces up and
down until it stops bouncing.

284
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:16,236
He's just like, all right.

285
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,196
- I love watching it.

286
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:18,173
Just like,

287
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:20,798
it can't really do that much.

288
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:22,799
- Oh no, it didn't speed.

289
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,320
- Oh no, it didn't speed.

290
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,460
I love hearing Australian people talk.

291
00:07:28,624 --> 00:07:29,485
Okay. That angle is way--

292
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:30,680
- That's funny.

293
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,400
All right, now we're 1500 feet in the air

294
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,402
and this mannequin's gonna get
kicked outta the helicopter.

295
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:35,507
- Oh, it's MythBusters.

296
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:38,665
- Ladies and gentlemen, this
is a Mythbuster's control.

297
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:39,861
- All right, so what are we myth busting?

298
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:41,371
What happens if you fall
out of a helicopter?

299
00:07:41,371 --> 00:07:42,919
- I think we already knew.

300
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,394
He said it was a control though.

301
00:07:44,394 --> 00:07:46,646
Maybe this is just to see
like the speed of how fast

302
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:47,479
a human drops.

303
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:50,230
- Dang.

304
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,423
- Oh, he hit,

305
00:07:51,423 --> 00:07:52,319
- He hit hard.

306
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,726
I think it's time to say it.

307
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:54,559
- Say it.

308
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,544
- Mannequins take a lot of flack.

309
00:07:55,544 --> 00:07:57,957
They do things that we
don't wanna do as humans.

310
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:58,918
- Yeah, that's true.

311
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:00,297
- And I think it's time
someone stands up for them.

312
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:02,424
- It better not be you
because there's a shipping

313
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:05,584
container with a thousand
mannequins jammed in it right now.

314
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:06,417
- You're right.

315
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:07,612
I do own a lot of mannequins.

316
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,647
You know what?

317
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:09,864
I'm no better than the rest of you.

318
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,578
Now we're gonna drop a Nokia from the sky.

319
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:12,452
Now here's the thing.

320
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,599
We all know Nokias are indestructible.

321
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,338
- Oh, the old, old joke
that everybody's heard

322
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:17,880
a hundred thousand times,

323
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,624
what do you think is gonna happen?

324
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,609
- Seeing how it's 1500 feet in the air?

325
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:22,853
I do think it's gonna break.

326
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:23,957
If this still works?

327
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:25,064
- What if it breaks the ground?

328
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:25,957
Where is it?

329
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:27,076
- What if just goes through Earth?

330
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:27,909
Did they lose?

331
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:29,434
- Whoa, my, they're all laughing.

332
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:31,533
But anyone could have been
just destroyed by that.

333
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:32,633
- Decked in the head.

334
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:33,544
Yeah. No, it doesn't work.

335
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:35,508
And now the moment we've
all been waiting for

336
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:36,660
- A Toyota!

337
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,680
- We're gonna go to the
highest of the highest heights

338
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,599
higher than everything
dropped in this video.

339
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,386
- And what are we gonna drop Jimmy?

340
00:08:42,386 --> 00:08:44,058
- A Toyota. The most durable

341
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:45,752
- Of course.

342
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:46,655
Good.

343
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:47,610
- Oh well the car's falling.

344
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,713
- Look at it. It kind of survived it.

345
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:50,085
Look, it's drivable.

346
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:51,322
Go ahead and crank her up.

347
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,484
- And now the final clip,
an iPad is about to fall

348
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:55,036
30,000 feet.

349
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:56,268
- 30,000 feet?

350
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:57,550
How did they get it up there?

351
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,541
- Weather balloon.

352
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,024
- Whether or not I asked
is the real question.

353
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:01,857
- You did.

354
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:02,690
- I did.

355
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,205
- This is the highest thing
dropped in this video.

356
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:05,617
- Whoa!

357
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:06,638
- Now she's tumbling.

358
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:08,055
- Look at her go!

359
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:10,236
- 30,000 feet.

360
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,630
Wait.

361
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,617
- That smacked the ground.

362
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:16,711
- In a previous video
we said we'd shout out

363
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:17,803
someone random that subscribed.

364
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:18,922
Here's that person.

365
00:09:18,922 --> 00:09:20,104
- Packer Anderson!

366
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:21,852
- I hope that satisfied
your alpha instinct.

367
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,162
That was things falling from high places.

368
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,798
Subscribe if you're not.
- Sigma.
