1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,660
- This is one of the dirtiest
beaches in the entire world.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,940
And we're gonna pick up
every single piece of trash

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,810
on this beach.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,640
Starting with this water bottle.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,830
One out of millions of pieces of trash.

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,663
- We did it!

7
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:12,496
- This will take forever.

8
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:13,329
[upbeat island music]

9
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,290
- Bottle me up, baby.

10
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,897
I'm hungry for your plastic.

11
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:20,250
- As you can see, this is taking forever.

12
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,480
Oscar, come on in.

13
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,400
This is Oscar, professional beach cleaner.

14
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,500
Is this basically how
you guys clean beaches?

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,150
- Mainly, we do the big stuff first

16
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,100
and then we bring a lot of
people with sifters as well

17
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,933
for the small stuff.

18
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:31,440
- You scoop it into this thing

19
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,700
and then shake out the sand,

20
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,900
and you got a bunch of trash.

21
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,360
This right here is the first bag of trash.

22
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,610
Hundreds more to go. How
do we do this quicker?

23
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,570
- We just need more people.

24
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,077
- That seems simple. Can you clap for me?

25
00:00:41,077 --> 00:00:42,210
[Oscar clapping]

26
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,975
There you go! All the volunteers.

27
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:45,600
(crowd cheering)

28
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,640
- Okay guys, we're gonna
clean this up using the vice.

29
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,680
We're gonna clean this up. Groups of four!

30
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,180
Groups of four in this area.

31
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,740
- Part of me wanted to
see if me and the boys

32
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,300
could clean up this beach by ourselves,

33
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,590
and the other part of me realizes

34
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,610
that would've taken a year.

35
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,140
- I could've told you that.

36
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,100
- Jimmy!

37
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,933
- [Jimmy] Yeah?

38
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:02,100
The ocean's putting
more trash on the beach.

39
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,080
There's so much underwear in the ocean.

40
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,370
- I'm enacting a new law.

41
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,710
Thou shall not throw your
underwear in the ocean.

42
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,420
- Wait, did you guys
already fill up a bag?

43
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,253
- Yeah.

44
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:11,086
- You guys are better than us.

45
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:12,680
They are professionals to be fair.

46
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,263
(upbeat music)

47
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,310
- After 12 hours of cleanup,

48
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,070
this is what we managed to
achieve, which isn't enough.

49
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,450
Boys, bring it in.

50
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,580
Tomorrow, I'm gonna bring
in 10 times the volunteers.

51
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,413
Tomorrow.

52
00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:28,246
(record scratching)

53
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:29,079
(flip-flop squeaks)

54
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:29,912
- Tomorrow.

55
00:01:29,912 --> 00:01:30,986
- It's now the next day.

56
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:32,890
(crowd cheers)

57
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,820
(upbeat music)

58
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,994
- I'm helping.

59
00:01:36,994 --> 00:01:38,730
- Nah, nah, nah.

60
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,960
- But as slowly as possible.

61
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,609
- Who's more bueno? Mark Rober or MrBeast?

62
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:43,442
- MrBeast.

63
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:44,700
(piano music)

64
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,350
- Make sure you watch
until the end of the video

65
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,550
to find out how we're gonna pick up

66
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,050
30 million pounds of trash.

67
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,030
- Thank you for coming to our country

68
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,220
and help us with this initiative.

69
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,857
That is really awesome.

70
00:01:54,857 --> 00:01:57,615
(upbeat music)

71
00:01:57,615 --> 00:01:59,430
- Right here. Right there.

72
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,200
Stop. He's not stopping.

73
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,033
I'm gonna move.

74
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:04,593
In this bad boy is 6,000 pounds of trash.

75
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,430
And now we have 36,000 pounds of trash,

76
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,030
which weighs the same as
3,000 cats or three T-rexes.

77
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,020
Whichever you prefer.

78
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,030
While I was talking
with some of the locals,

79
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,100
they mentioned that there's
a beach down the street

80
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,450
that was also very dirty.

81
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,580
So I said Nolan with a bunch of volunteers

82
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,260
to go clean that beach as well.

83
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,093
There's a whole car bumper right here.

84
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:25,740
- There's a car bumper here?
Did this come outta the ocean?

85
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,120
- People litter weird things.

86
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,800
- What type of trash have
you seen along the beach?

87
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,960
- Most importantly, most
commonly is plastics.

88
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,030
And we see that in every
form on the beach here.

89
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,670
- They ended up removing
12,000 pounds of trash,

90
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,990
which brought us up to a total

91
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,870
of 50,000 pounds of trash
from just two beaches.

92
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,580
- Check out this power move. Watch this.

93
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,898
Look at that!

94
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:44,280
- Is that how you want us to dump it?

95
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,720
- Yeah, dude, I'm taking one for the team.

96
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,920
I'm a team player.

97
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,690
Oh yeah. I don't even have to look.

98
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,770
- There you go, Mark.

99
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,730
- It actually kind of works.

100
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,563
- See?

101
00:02:51,563 --> 00:02:52,710
- And if you guys look over there,

102
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,050
we're actually getting close
to the end of the beach.

103
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,100
This is what the beach looked

104
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,180
like at the start of the video.

105
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,580
And this is what it looks
like with like 20% left.

106
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,413
We're getting there.

107
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:01,246
- We're doing it!

108
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:03,660
- Unfortunately, between
the ocean washing up trash

109
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,940
to the beach and rivers
bringing in new trash from

110
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,000
the mainland, obviously this
beach is gonna get dirty again.

111
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,940
But with your guys' help, we
can stop a much bigger issue.

112
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,350
- We're almost done, Jimmy.

113
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,290
- I know! Four straight
days of picking up trash.

114
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,710
And just like that, we removed
over 60,000 pounds of trash

115
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,300
from the world's dirtiest beach.

116
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,210
And even though this 60,000
pounds of trash we picked up

117
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,350
might seem impressive,

118
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,170
there is sadly way too much
trash still in the ocean.

119
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,630
Two years ago, we crushed
our goals with Team Trees

120
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,460
and planted 20 million trees.

121
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,470
- And now it's time to do it again.

122
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,200
- Which is why we, along with
hundreds of other creators,

123
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,580
are launching Team Seas.

124
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,460
And for every $1 you
guys donate, like this,

125
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,710
one less pound of trash
will be in the ocean.

126
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,290
- But what if I wanted
to donate $10, Jimmy?

127
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,870
- I conveniently have 10
pounds of trash right here

128
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,730
that is now out of the ocean.

129
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,563
- Boom. Gone.

130
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:52,396
- You get the point.

131
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:55,080
One dollar donated as one less
pound of trash in the ocean.

132
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,180
And I'd like to personally
thank YouTube Originals

133
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,310
for supporting Team Seas
and helping us fund it.

134
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,920
They're gonna be matching
the first $400,000

135
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,900
worth of donations, dollar for dollar.

136
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,910
And we wanna remove 30 million pounds

137
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,200
of trash from the ocean.

138
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,270
- Which is just so freaking audacious.

139
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,880
This only happens if we all work together.

140
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,740
- Half the money we raise is going towards

141
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,040
funding volunteer beach
cleanups like we did here today,

142
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,410
all across the world, as well as literally

143
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,330
fishing trash out of the ocean.

144
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,100
- And the other half
will be used for these

145
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,491
trash-eating robots that
pick up trash 24 hours a day,

146
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:30,660
365 days a year, from rivers
that flow to the ocean.

147
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,060
- Go to teamseas.org or
click the donate button

148
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,087
below this video right now.

149
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:36,600
$1 equals one less pound
of trash in the ocean.

150
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,150
Making real change like
this isn't gonna be easy.

151
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,090
Go donate right now and help
us remove 30 million pounds

152
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,950
of trash from the ocean
before the end of the year.

153
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,223
Let's show the world that
we want a clean ocean.

154
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:48,973
(soulful music)

155
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,063
- What are you doing?

156
00:04:53,063 --> 00:04:57,883
Get outta here. Go donate.
