00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:06,765
Dholakpur…a kingdom where there
was a peaceful atmosphere.

2
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:14,276
However, some evil people set
their eyes on this lovely kingdom.

3
00:00:14,276 --> 00:00:16,384
Peace turned into destruction.

4
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:19,409
Now, there is only one brave person
who could save Dholakpur.

5
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,953
Bheem...

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,755
The earth will tremble,
humans will shiver…

13
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:51,167
Now, it is time for Damyaan
to rule the world…

14
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:52,477
Have power.
Have lots of power.

15
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:02,256
Have power.
Have lots of power.
