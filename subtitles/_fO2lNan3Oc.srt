1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Sri Ram, the solo hero of Ramayan.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,600
In the first reel itself
he was banished for 14 years.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,120
Mother Sita went along for company.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,480
That's where the villain made
an entry. Ravan.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,920
It rhymes.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,600
What is he saying?

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,560
He kidnapped mother Sita
from outdoor.

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,200
But right then,
Hanuman made a daring entry..

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,600
..in the supporting role.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,200
He took a bus to Lanka..

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,320
..and disrobed Ravan.
- Hello. That's wrong.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,040
The Ramayan and the Mahabharat..

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,520
..are different scriptures.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,800
Hey you fool, its people like you..

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,360
..who don't let us dons
change their profession.

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,640
Don't cry, boss.
