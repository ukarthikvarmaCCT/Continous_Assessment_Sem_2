1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,474
Raipur is 285 Km ahead.

2
00:00:02,888 --> 00:00:05,414
This is Indravati river.

3
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:06,213
And

4
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:07,866
It go's there and make fall.

5
00:00:25,553 --> 00:00:26,828
What's up guys, welcome back to the vlog.

6
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:28,667
 Yesterday I stopped here, Ghee Desi.

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,710
I come here to eat again because
the food here was very tasty.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,766
Let's go.

9
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:41,132
I am just leaving for Raipur,
my flight ticket was for yesterday.

10
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:44,341
I will get it Pre-Pon for today.

11
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,260
But the plan has changed.

12
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:47,724
There is nothing to do here.

13
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:49,455
And nothing is needed, No No.

14
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:50,473
Just have to leave.

15
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:51,922
I am on Cut to Cut to time.

16
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:53,625
I have a 5 hour drive from here.

17
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:54,731
I have driven this a lot.

18
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:56,669
but if I will tell you
honestly the biggest fear is,

19
00:00:57,316 --> 00:00:59,464
 To reverse and now specially,

20
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,750
Ever since I have taken my
BMW, there's a camera behind it.

21
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,789
So I have become so used to camera now,
that I don't know what to do without it.

22
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,868
This is Keshkai market this is
where I bought my underwears.

23
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:11,247
Terrible mountain road starts from here.

24
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:19,353
Today i woke up at 5:30 am.

25
00:01:19,961 --> 00:01:20,873
Then in morning went to,

26
00:01:21,993 --> 00:01:22,558
The falls .

27
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,542
So it's 4 o'clock now
that's why  i'm sleepy now.

28
00:01:25,776 --> 00:01:28,314
The person who is used to got up
at 11am in day got up at 5:30am.

29
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:30,814
Look at the front, I will show you.

30
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,230
When we used to travel because of desh Ka
Dhoni, Ritu and I used to rest here like this.

31
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:39,486
You used to sit at such a place,
you used to leg massage of me.

32
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:40,869
We used to rest.

33
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:43,074
I am feeling much better after facewash.

34
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,008
What happened  to Pushparaj,
they were taking wood.

35
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:48,368
Look at this, bro.

36
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:49,741
This is Instagram tease.

37
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:51,919
Oh brother.

38
00:02:00,356 --> 00:02:01,261
Take this Gau Mata.

39
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:02,169
Eat this.

40
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,545
She eats.

41
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:13,985
Thank you.

42
00:02:15,596 --> 00:02:18,122
I got the corn and will go on
eating now to reach Raipur.

43
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,663
Bro, why I am feeling like this,

44
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:27,834
That this road won't
take me to the airport.

45
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,333
Gau Mata!

46
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:34,302
Is there a way to the airport from here?

47
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:35,732
Is this road going to the airport?

48
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:38,802
- Ok, Thank you.

49
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:40,882
But the surprising thing is that.

50
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:43,302
Off to the national highway,

51
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,353
This is the way to the airport.

52
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,793
Gau Mata move out.

53
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:49,819
how can I pass.

54
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:52,630
It is not even written here
where is the way to the airport

55
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:54,463
GPS is saying I have reached airport.

56
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:56,423
From where will the
Plane take off from here.

57
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:57,537
Where did this GPS has reach us.

58
00:02:57,546 --> 00:02:59,657
Have reached the airport,
the hunger is terrible.

59
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:00,945
Dosa followed by a coffee.

60
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:01,932
Coffee is over.

61
00:03:01,988 --> 00:03:03,289
The Dosa was average,

62
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,229
coffee was good.

63
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:07,071
The whole airport is
empty, only I am sitting here.

64
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:09,558
Our flight is from above and it is the last
flight of the day after that the airport is closed

65
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:30,401
Since morning, I was carrying heavy camera bag in my backpack
and was roaming all around fall and now my neck is paining

66
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,585
my condition has worsened by night now

67
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:35,163
Because I am an old man now.

68
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,158
And traveling solo with
so much stuff is hurting.

69
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:41,185
I am having terrible neck pain.

70
00:03:41,953 --> 00:03:46,150
Earlier I was down there was silence now when
I came up there is silence everyone went down.

71
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:47,787
I have to lift this heavy bag again.

72
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:49,178
No worries.

73
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:52,031
In the last vlog you have saw that
i have to go to explore the caves.

74
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:53,490
But there, water level was
increased then I thought,

75
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:56,986
I am leaving for Delhi today
itself, it was my unplanned travel.

76
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:58,418
On the airport I was about,

77
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:03,361
To board then I thought I message
the Ritu that I am coming delhi today.

78
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:05,622
You know what, Ritu messaged me?

79
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,418
The captain of this flight was,

80
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,558
Our Captain Ritu Rathi.

81
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:27,050
I was so happy

82
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:30,973
I sat on my seat, I didn't go to meet her
as she has just learned to fly the plane.

83
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,388
Let not disturb her.

84
00:04:32,852 --> 00:04:34,538
Let's fly and i will
meet her after landing.

85
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:38,113
I didn't told anyone that the
captain of this flight is my wife

86
00:04:38,138 --> 00:04:42,296
And I thoght let's do some fun, I asked my nearby
passengers that how did you like today's take off.

87
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:43,126
It was nice.

88
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:46,353
I am feeling like I am
in roller coaster now.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,644
You liked it or not.

90
00:04:49,943 --> 00:04:51,089
- It was okay
- Could have been better

91
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:51,692
Yeah

92
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:54,032
Actually it is my first time.

93
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:55,546
So, yes it was ok-ok.

94
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:56,012
- Yes

95
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,690
I have flown a lot, usually
take offs are better than this.

96
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:01,325
- Okay

97
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:04,916
Yeah, it was nice.

98
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:05,750
- It's quite
- You liked it?

99
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,569
I think she is flying for the first time.

100
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,932
And I am myself pilot so.

101
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:16,117
So, it was pretty smooth

102
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:17,536
Let us see how's the landing goes.

103
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,650
Descent is started
landing is going to be done.

104
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,570
I hope she will land pretty good.

105
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:22,953
And if she doen't do it well.

106
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:25,434
I will tease her till one year.

107
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:28,030
Whenever she say, I said i landed better.

108
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:29,993
I have been in her
flight for 1-2 times only.

109
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:33,217
And she always land ok-ok so,
today she has to do a good landing.

110
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:34,698
But i am sure she will land good.

111
00:05:34,707 --> 00:05:36,108
Because i said to Ritu,

112
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:39,425
Whenever you will fly, I
will come in your flight.

113
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,834
And I leaved on that day,
she doen't have a flight today.

114
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:44,594
Today she got flying.

115
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:47,416
And imagine I have to
go tomorrow and today.

116
00:05:47,744 --> 00:05:50,177
Those caves were closed today,
so I thought that I will leave today.

117
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:51,616
And I am on that flight.

118
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:52,324
God

119
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:53,742
Thank you so much.

120
00:05:56,428 --> 00:05:57,152
Thank you so much

121
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,618
Mau please open the door.

122
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:15,006
Open it, Open it.

123
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:17,405
He is following Mumma.

124
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:18,852
I have came after so many days.

125
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:20,165
What are you saying?

126
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:23,410
I was not supposed to come

127
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,748
Then after i came.

128
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:27,660
When the descent started,
I went to the washroom.

129
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:28,626
I didn't go to washroom.

130
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:31,164
As soon as i left the
washroom, she went in it.

131
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:32,122
Just after me.

132
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:34,822
Before that you were sleeping.

133
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:36,683
See the coincidence, I was not sleeping.

134
00:06:37,202 --> 00:06:39,356
Means she has to go
washroom even with the husband.

135
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:40,301
Wow

136
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:41,996
You have wearing my socks

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,850
I have bought my underwear
from roadside while travelling.

138
00:06:45,264 --> 00:06:47,320
I am sleeping with kids
you sleep in another room.
