1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,996
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:00,996 --> 00:00:04,310
Farmers are protesting on the streets once again

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,284
and this time their biggest demand

4
00:00:06,284 --> 00:00:07,962
is MSP.

5
00:00:07,962 --> 00:00:10,973
The legalisation of Minimum Support Price.

6
00:00:10,973 --> 00:00:11,663
"MSP"

7
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:13,099
"Minimum Support Price"

8
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:14,636
"MSP for all crops."

9
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:16,872
Many news anchors and YouTubers claim that

10
00:00:16,872 --> 00:00:19,230
if the government fulfils this demand

11
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,054
then it will completely destroy the country's economy.

12
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:24,847
It will cost more than ₹10 Trillion!

13
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:26,694
What is the truth behind this?

14
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:29,035
Is the demand of farmers right or wrong?

15
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:31,662
Let's understand the reality of the farming industry

16
00:00:31,662 --> 00:00:33,252
in today's video.

17
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:43,524
MRP, or Maximum Retail Price,

18
00:00:43,524 --> 00:00:47,019
is the maximum price at which 
things can be sold in the market.

19
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:52,237
MRP exists to protect consumers 
and the general public in the country.

20
00:00:52,237 --> 00:00:55,061
So that no company or shopkeeper can exploit us.

21
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:56,418
If there was no MRP,

22
00:00:56,418 --> 00:00:59,318
you can imagine how terribly 
people would have been exploited.

23
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:01,632
If you were in the desert and facing water shortages,

24
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:04,160
someone could try to sell a bottle of water for ₹2,000.

25
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,000
If there was a cooking oil shortage in your city,

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,625
you could be forced to buy cooking oil for ₹1,000 per litre.

27
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,779
Now, in contrast to MRP, the opposite is MSP,

28
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:13,459
that is, Minimum Support Price.

29
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:17,326
The minimum amount that would be 
paid to the farmers for their crops.

30
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:18,588
The reason remains the same.

31
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:21,188
So that companies and middlemen can't exploit them.

32
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:23,812
Even if the buyers set up a mafia,

33
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:28,911
the farmer shouldn't be forced to sell 
onions for ₹2 and garlic for ₹0.50.

34
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:31,719
They should have a guarantee of a minimum price.

35
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,304
Like MRP, MSP is also very logical,

36
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:38,416
that's why most politicians have always favoured it.

37
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:42,021
Like BJP leader Narendra Modi before 2014.

38
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:43,288
Listen to what he said.

39
00:01:43,288 --> 00:01:44,891
"Minimum Support Price

40
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:47,508
is a headache for every farmer.

41
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:48,945
But for the government,

42
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:52,509
it has become a great way 
to force their will."

43
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:55,560
In one state, the minimum support 
price for wheat will be something,

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,025
in the next state, it will be another.

45
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:58,947
In one place, the rate of rice will be something,

46
00:01:58,947 --> 00:02:00,201
in another place, it will be something else.

47
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:02,917
But everywhere, the buyer is the Indian government.

48
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:05,276
"But the farmers don't get the right price.

49
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:06,184
Why?

50
00:02:06,184 --> 00:02:09,943
The policy of deciding the price 
has not been implemented."

51
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:10,673
Wow!

52
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:13,551
How well Narendra Modi explained this problem!

53
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:14,834
A big round of applause for him.

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,418
And not only the problem,

55
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:17,713
he gives us the solution too.

56
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:18,565
Listen further.

57
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:20,175
"Brothers and sisters,

58
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:22,671
we have stated in our manifesto,

59
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:31,404
that we will decide the MSP 
based on rules and regulations."

60
00:02:31,404 --> 00:02:34,888
"That is why we have said that 
the cost of input for the farmer,

61
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:40,964
water, labour, electricity, 
seeds, fertilisers, medicines,

62
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:43,651
whatever the cost is,

63
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:47,214
50% profit will be added to that cost.

64
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,557
And that will be the MSP they'll have to sell at."

65
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:54,142
In India, MSP is issued by CACP,

66
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:56,562
the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices.

67
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:58,405
It is a decentralised agency

68
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:00,702
which was established in 1965.

69
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:05,078
And today, it functions under the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.

70
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:08,480
But the question is, how should the MSP be decided?

71
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,039
How much should the MSP be?

72
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,131
In 2002, a committee was formed,

73
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:14,655
the High Level Committee on Long Term Grain Policy,

74
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:17,201
headed by economist Abhijit Sen.

75
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,750
This committee said that MSP should be

76
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,151
based on C2 cost of production.

77
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:24,050
But, what does this mean?

78
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,666
To understand C2, we need to 
understand A2 and FL costs first.

79
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,328
First comes A2 cost.

80
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:31,657
This is the cost that farmers have to pay

81
00:03:31,657 --> 00:03:33,458
as direct expenses.

82
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:42,289
Farmers buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, 
hire labourers to work in their fields, fuel cost,

83
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,833
these are the A2 costs.

84
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,472
After this comes the FL cost.

85
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:47,329
FL's full form is Family Labour.

86
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,200
This cost is an estimated value

87
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,680
of unpaid family labour.

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,964
When a farmer works in his field,

89
00:03:53,964 --> 00:03:57,167
often his family members help him in farming.

90
00:03:57,167 --> 00:04:01,315
Because his family members invest their time to help him,

91
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:03,286
there should be a labour cost for them too.

92
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:06,831
They could have used this time to do some other job.

93
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:09,324
They missed the opportunity of getting a job.

94
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:12,337
This is known as Opportunity Cost in economics.

95
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:14,061
So, these were the A2 and FL costs.

96
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:19,665
Today, CACP takes A2 + FL cost to decide MSP

97
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:21,574
and multiplies it by 1.5.

98
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:24,543
This is how MSP is decided today.

99
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:27,142
But Abhijit Sen's committee said that

100
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,469
we need to consider the C2 cost.

101
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,498
C2 refers to the Comprehensive Cost.

102
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,568
In C2 cost, not only do we take the A2 and FL costs,

103
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:39,017
but we consider the cost of Owned Capital 
and the Rental Value of Land.

104
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:41,127
You can understand this better with an example.

105
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:44,005
Think of a photographer who has his own studio.

106
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:45,428
To carry on his business,

107
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:47,803
not only does he have to 
spend money to take photos,

108
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:49,249
and to print photos,

109
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,156
but also to buy a camera,

110
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:53,046
and even to pay rent the rent for the studio.

111
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:54,756
Like a photographer's studio,

112
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:57,273
a farmer's land has a rental value.

113
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:58,994
If the farmer owns the land,

114
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:00,307
then it is his capital.

115
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:01,876
And if he doesn't own it,

116
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:03,439
then he pays rent on it.

117
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,657
Apart from this, like the photographer's 
camera and studio lights,

118
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:10,396
a farmer has to buy a tractor and a cultivator.

119
00:05:10,396 --> 00:05:13,824
The farmer doesn't buy a tractor just for fun.

120
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:16,108
A tractor is bought to be used for agriculture.

121
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:19,171
So, shouldn't that cost be taken into account too?

122
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:22,580
All these are called Owned Capital Assets.

123
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,297
And Abhijeet Sen's commission report stated that

124
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:31,016
in C2 cost, we should include 
the A2 cost, FL cost, and this extra cost.

125
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:33,726
And then make it the new basis for MSP.

126
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:36,107
Friends, after this, a Swaminathan report was released.

127
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:39,720
In 2004, M.S. Swaminathan

128
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,253
was heading the National Commission on Farmers.

129
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:44,339
You might have heard of him already

130
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,889
he was one of the architects of the Green Revolution.

131
00:05:47,543 --> 00:05:50,022
Between 2004 and 2006,

132
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:52,780
the Swaminathan Commission released 5 reports.

133
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,994
In total, these reports spanned almost 2,000 pages.

134
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:59,839
On the 246th page of the 5th report, it is written that

135
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,802
the MSP should be at least 50% more than 
the Weighted Average Cost of Production.

136
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:06,816
Now some people get confused that

137
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:12,736
whether the Swaminathan Commission 
was talking about C2 cost or A2+FL cost.

138
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:14,928
But if we read the entire report,

139
00:06:14,928 --> 00:06:16,196
there is no confusion.

140
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:18,629
Between pages 74 to 84,

141
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,024
there's a detailed discussion on

142
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:21,692
how in most of the states,

143
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:24,809
MSP does not even recover the C2 cost.

144
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:27,197
And if this C2 cost is not recovered,

145
00:06:27,197 --> 00:06:31,192
then farmers will stop farming 
those crops in the long term.

146
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:33,037
This 278-page report

147
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:35,295
is available on the Ministry of Agriculture's website.

148
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,086
If you want to read it, 
the link is in the description below.

149
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:40,505
Economics Professor R. Ramakumar says that

150
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:44,786
when MS Swaminathan presented this 
report to the Union Agriculture Minister,

151
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:48,794
the 22nd slide of that presentation clearly mentioned that

152
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:54,820
MSP would be calculated at 
C2 cost plus 50%.

153
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,502
On 28th September 2017, 
MS Swaminathan tweeted that

154
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:01,705
MSP should be at least C2 + 50%

155
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:04,758
with procurement, storage, 
and distribution costs included.

156
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,051
He went one step further.

157
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,494
He started talking about post-harvest costs too.

158
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:11,984
When farmers store their crops,

159
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:13,289
they will incur storage costs too,

160
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:15,179
we should take those into account.

161
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:16,889
This was mentioned not only in this tweet,

162
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:20,106
but also in the second report of 
the Swaminathan Commission.

163
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,201
On page 412, it was written that

164
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:25,075
"The CACP should look into the aspects of risk factor,

165
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:27,378
marketing, and post-harvest expenses."

166
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:30,635
It might feel that he wants to pay 
a lot of money to the farmers.

167
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:32,919
That our country's economy will crash

168
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,062
if we start paying farmers so much.

169
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:36,520
But think about it.

170
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,363
Doesn't every other business in the country

171
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:41,153
run like this?

172
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:43,966
All the costs incurred in running any business

173
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,360
are taken into account.

174
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,740
Most companies account for their

175
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,321
office vehicles, travel,

176
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:51,906
TV, trolley bags, blazers,

177
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:55,023
networking, tea, snacks, pizza,

178
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:56,984
everything as Company Expenses.

179
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,656
So, for farmers to take these four costs into account, 

180
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:00,609
what's wrong with that?

181
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:03,089
The input cost of seed, fertilisers, and water,

182
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,192
the cost of their family labour,

183
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:07,306
the cost of their capital assets,

184
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:10,738
and finally the marketing and post-harvest expenses.

185
00:08:10,738 --> 00:08:13,647
Swaminathan report mentioned two more interesting things.

186
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:17,628
First, MSP should not only be applied to the government

187
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:19,029
but also to private traders.

188
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:20,789
Whoever is buying directly from the farmers

189
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:22,746
should buy at least at the MSP.

190
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:26,638
And second, MSP should be considered only as a bottom line.

191
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:28,918
So that no one can buy produce cheaper than it.

192
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:30,742
But when the government buys,

193
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:32,748
they should buy it at the same price

194
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:34,467
as the private traders.

195
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:36,299
If the market price increases,

196
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,015
then the government should pay more.

197
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:39,861
This report even said that

198
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:41,351
the income of the farmers

199
00:08:41,351 --> 00:08:43,825
should be comparable to that of the civil servants.

200
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:44,976
Imagine that.

201
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:46,722
But anyhow, there's no point in talking about it now.

202
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:49,679
We will consider only the C2 + 50% cost.

203
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,879
Now the question is,

204
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,052
who will support the farmers to 
get them the right price for their produce?

205
00:08:54,052 --> 00:09:00,495
"I want to free the farmers from 
government's unfair practices." 

206
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:02,113
Narendra Modi!

207
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:04,526
Not only did he talk about farmers and MSP,

208
00:09:04,526 --> 00:09:06,809
he took an oath!

209
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:09,145
"To improve India's economic standing,

210
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:12,099
we need to first improve the farmers' economic standing.

211
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:13,788
And to that extent,

212
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:17,493
we, the BJP, are here to ask for your blessings."

213
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,013
A big round of applause for him.

214
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:22,184
Such a talent for putting his point across.

215
00:09:22,184 --> 00:09:24,683
Explained the problem in the first 2 minutes

216
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:26,105
and then gave a solution.

217
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:27,592
And what he says next,

218
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:29,487
will bring tears to your eyes.

219
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:31,835
"Lal Bahadur Shastri used to say,

220
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,170
"Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan.""

221
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,330
He said, the number of soldiers who died on the battlefield,

222
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,549
more than that, farmers have committed su!cide.

223
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:43,208
They had to d!e a helpless de@th.

224
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,174
And that's why, he addresses the crowd,

225
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:47,100
if India has to change,

226
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,329
then India's villages have to change first.

227
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,354
"If India has to change,

228
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:54,348
then India's villages have to change first."

229
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:57,131
To be honest, friends, 
I don't have anything left to say.

230
00:09:57,647 --> 00:10:00,638
Narendra Modi talked about this in such a great way.

231
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:02,790
But what happened after this video?

232
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,688
The people gave their blessings.

233
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,664
In 2014, Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister.

234
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:10,561
Two years later, he made another big promise.

235
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:14,611
By 2022, when India celebrates its 75th Independence Day,

236
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:17,083
farmers' income will be double.

237
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,514
Now some people will say that

238
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:20,892
Modi could not do this because of COVID.

239
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:22,419
Even though he did his best.

240
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,260
But even if we ignore the two years of COVID.

241
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,444
If not 2022, then it should have doubled by 2024.

242
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:29,536
Instead of doubling the farmers' income,

243
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:32,477
instead of giving them the MSP at C2 + 50%,

244
00:10:32,477 --> 00:10:34,284
what did the Modi government do?

245
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:36,434
They passed 3 black laws.

246
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:38,393
The 3 Farm Laws.

247
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:40,086
I had made videos on this before,

248
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:41,400
when these laws were passed.

249
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,152
In one video, I showed you how

250
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:47,108
unconstitutionally they passed the bills in the Parliament.

251
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:48,735
But the second problem was,

252
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:52,399
these bills were actually favouring 
the corporates over the farmers.

253
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,782
It's not that before the laws were introduced,

254
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:57,123
the farmers couldn't enter into 
contract farming with the corporates.

255
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,530
Obviously, they could.

256
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,374
But the provisions in those 3 Farm Laws

257
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:03,565
was basically like telling the corporates

258
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:07,777
that they could buy, sell, and set up markets arbitrarily.

259
00:11:07,777 --> 00:11:09,565
Government markets would be taxed,

260
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:11,490
but there would be no taxes on private markets.

261
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,233
What was an unfair practice before,

262
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:14,571
corporates could now begin hoarding,

263
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:16,385
raise the prices artificially,

264
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,298
no reins on corporate actions.

265
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:18,771
Almost in every aspect,

266
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:22,035
large corporate companies were 
given an advantage over the farmers.

267
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:25,393
Last year in August, a report was 
published in the Reporters Collective,

268
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,431
which revealed some interesting 
facts about these farm laws.

269
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:30,901
It was revealed that a man named Sharad Marathe,

270
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:34,733
had written a letter to the then Vice 
Chairperson of Niti Aayog, Rajiv Kumar.

271
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,998
They knew each other before.

272
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:38,305
This letter talked about

273
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:43,305
the need to introduce market-driven 
agriculture business model in India.

274
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,369
Look at Niti Aayog's office 
memorandum from 16th October 2017,

275
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:51,347
It talks about Sharad Marathe's concept note.

276
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:55,153
It was suggested that Niti Aayog 
set up a task force for this.

277
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:55,898
And guess what?

278
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:57,630
A task force was set up.

279
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,984
Who was on that task force?

280
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:00,967
Sharad Marathe himself.

281
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:02,514
Apart from this, corporations like

282
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,162
Adani Group, Patanjali, Big Basket,

283
00:12:05,162 --> 00:12:06,488
Mahindra Group, and ITC,

284
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:09,439
but there were no farmers on this task force.

285
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:10,866
In fact, forget about any farmer,

286
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:14,275
no farmer organisations or 
economists were on this task force.

287
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,771
The next report tells us how

288
00:12:15,771 --> 00:12:17,323
Adani Group's companies wanted

289
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:20,677
the Essential Commodities Act to be repealed.

290
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:25,881
Because this Act prohibited companies from hoarding.

291
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:28,345
Why did Adani Group want to have this act repealed?

292
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:30,286
Perhaps, this is connect to an old event.

293
00:12:30,286 --> 00:12:32,236
Pulse Scam from 2015.

294
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:33,625
"In April this year,

295
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:37,251
the price of Arhar Dal (pigeon pea) 
starts spiking all of a sudden.

296
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:40,479
The dal which was available 
in the market for less than ₹70,

297
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:43,002
started costing more than ₹200."

298
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:46,417
In 2015, the pulses reached ₹200 per Kg.

299
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,234
The government carried out raids

300
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,786
6,077 raids in total.

301
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:52,935
More than 70,000 tonnes of pulses were seized,

302
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:54,913
which were being illegally hoarded.

303
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:56,612
Who was benefiting from this?

304
00:12:56,612 --> 00:12:58,460
Look at this report in Business Today.

305
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,003
The Competition Commission of India raided

306
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:04,580
the offices of Glencore, Export Trading Group, and Edelweiss Group.

307
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,054
When an income tax probe was conducted, it was found that

308
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:08,889
Glencore, Edelweiss, and ETG were the major players

309
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,803
in this Pulse Price Rigging case.

310
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:14,314
And finally, look at this EPW report.

311
00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:15,662
Glencore had investments in

312
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:19,359
the ETC group's ETC Agro Processing (India) Private Limited.

313
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:21,365
And Adani Group was connected to Glencore

314
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:23,424
through a joint venture,

315
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:25,322
ChemOil Adani Private Limited.

316
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:26,815
So, it's quite simple, friends.

317
00:13:26,815 --> 00:13:29,559
When lentils were being sold for ₹200 per kg,

318
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,163
the common man was suffering.

319
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:33,821
The farmers were not benefiting,

320
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:37,106
but some corporate companies 
in the middle were benefiting.

321
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:39,536
And what should the government 
have done in such a case?

322
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:42,678
Should the anti-hoarding laws have been made stricter?

323
00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:44,512
Or should it have been relaxed

324
00:13:44,512 --> 00:13:46,609
to make it easier for companies to hoard?

325
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:49,170
Obviously, they should have made it stricter.

326
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,997
Instead, the government introduced 
these three farm laws.

327
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,082
Some people tried to justify the farm laws by saying that,

328
00:13:57,082 --> 00:14:01,693
the Swaminathan report mentioned the 
need to liberalise the agriculture sector.

329
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:03,841
To bring in some market reforms.

330
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:04,841
This is true.

331
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:06,468
If you read the Swaminathan report,

332
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:09,477
it is written on page 31 of the 5th report,

333
00:14:09,477 --> 00:14:13,055
that the role of State APMC's needs to be reviewed.

334
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:15,381
We need to move towards a single Indian market.

335
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:18,100
Even while bringing farm laws, the government had said

336
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,597
One Nation, One Market.

337
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:21,874
But the problem lies in the details.

338
00:14:22,218 --> 00:14:24,274
Well, the marketing terms

339
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:26,909
can be contorted in any manner.

340
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,615
*The devil is in the details*

341
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:31,343
But the MSP mentioned in the Swaminathan report

342
00:14:31,343 --> 00:14:33,734
the C2 + 50% formula,

343
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:36,341
they were not included in the farm laws.

344
00:14:36,754 --> 00:14:40,145
Friends, do you know the status 
of MSP implementation today?

345
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:44,223
According to the Shanta Kumar Committee 
appointed by the Central Government,

346
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,808
only 6% of farmers get the benefit of MSP.

347
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:49,450
Some other reports state that

348
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,692
6% is an underestimate,

349
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:54,045
but let's believe Shanta Kumar,

350
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:55,889
who is a BJP politician

351
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:58,608
and a former Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh.

352
00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:01,174
In 2020, he told The Print that

353
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:04,323
only the elite 6% of farmers get the benefit of MSP,

354
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:06,683
and they are the ones opposing the farm laws.

355
00:15:06,683 --> 00:15:08,460
This is true to some extent.

356
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,950
Most of the farmers who are protesting today

357
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,664
are from Haryana, Punjab, 
and some are from Western UP.

358
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:14,639
Why is this?

359
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,721
Think about it yourself.

360
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:17,731
Farmers can be grouped into two.

361
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:20,635
Something is being snatched away from one of the groups.

362
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:23,756
The one that benefits from MSP now, 
but will soon lose the benefit.

363
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,088
Will they protest?

364
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:27,987
Or the other group of farmers, 
who never benefited from MSP?

365
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:29,867
Take the example of Bihar.

366
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:33,285
In 2006, Bihar abolished the APMC Act.

367
00:15:33,285 --> 00:15:35,517
What did the farmers of Bihar get from this?

368
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:39,638
This report tells us that between 
2007-08 and 2016-17,

369
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,165
in these 10 years,

370
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:42,746
there was not a single season where

371
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:46,536
Bihar's farmers could sell at a price higher than the MSP.

372
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:49,424
The report of 2018 shows that farmers in Bihar

373
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:51,982
had to sell wheat at a price lower than MSP.

374
00:15:51,982 --> 00:15:54,321
A 2020 study shows that Punjab's farmers

375
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,724
get a 30% higher crop price

376
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:58,433
in comparison to Bihar's farmers,

377
00:15:58,433 --> 00:15:59,992
only because of MSP.

378
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,591
So the rest of the farmers who are not protesting

379
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:04,592
are in even worse situations.

380
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:07,694
Ideally, the remaining 94% of the farmers

381
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:09,375
should also be brought under provision of MSP.

382
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,452
But what did the government try to do?

383
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:15,212
It tried to take away MSP from the few who were getting it.

384
00:16:15,212 --> 00:16:16,727
That's why 3 years ago,

385
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,760
the farmers' protest was on a large scale.

386
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:24,572
The protests went on for a year.

387
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:27,251
Around 600-700 people lost their lives in those protests

388
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:30,643
and after that, those farm laws were, thankfully, repealed.

389
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:31,792
But what about now?

390
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,360
Since the protests began again,

391
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,824
it was for the original demand

392
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:37,877
for the promise made by Narendra Modi in 2014.

393
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:39,334
MSP's legal guarantee,

394
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,265
for farmers to get a fair price.

395
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:43,873
If Narendra Modi demands MSP, it's alright.

396
00:16:43,873 --> 00:16:45,739
But if farmers demand it, it somehow becomes wrong.

397
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,320
*There is a limit to hypocrisy*

398
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:51,252
Look at this article from 20th February.

399
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:55,183
The government has banned more 
than 177 social media accounts

400
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:58,040
just because they were talking about farmers' right.

401
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,538
When these accounts were banned,

402
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:01,447
Twitter came out with a public reply.

403
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:03,842
That they banned the accounts 
on the orders of the government,

404
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:05,919
even though they acknowledged that 
the government's actions were wrong,

405
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,986
since it goes against freedom of expression.

406
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,842
Kisan Ekta Morcha had 500,000 followers.

407
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:12,643
It's been banned for the last 2 years.

408
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:14,503
It was banned during the last farmers' protest.

409
00:17:14,503 --> 00:17:17,165
On Twitter, many journalists and users say that

410
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:19,147
whenever they tweeted in favour of farmers,

411
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:21,221
the government banned their accounts.

412
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:22,848
And when, in my videos, I talk about

413
00:17:22,848 --> 00:17:24,532
our country moving towards dictatorship,

414
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:27,148
some people come at me to say that 
the country is still a democracy.

415
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:30,000
Tell me, in which democracy have you heard of

416
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,222
people speaking in favour of farmers on social media,

417
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:35,945
having their social media accounts banned on a mass scale?

418
00:17:35,945 --> 00:17:38,329
I have not seen this happening in any democracy.

419
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:41,128
But here I would like to give you a solution.

420
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,517
To bypass the bans on these accounts.

421
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,930
This can be done by using a VPN.

422
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,344
You can download any VPN app on your phone

423
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:50,401
and with it, you can spoof your location.

424
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:53,329
Because the government can ban accounts only within India,

425
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:54,945
not outside India.

426
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:57,730
You can change the location of your phone through VPN.

427
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,845
You can set the location to any place outside India.

428
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,302
USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, anywhere.

429
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:05,670
And you will be able to see the 
blocked accounts even if you are in India.

430
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,737
In my opinion, NordVPN is one of the best VPN apps.

431
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,577
It has more than 6,000 servers

432
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:11,887
in 67 countries.

433
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:13,501
The best advantage of this is that

434
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:14,952
no matter which country you go to,

435
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:18,867
you can bypass any local restrictions in that country.

436
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:21,050
The Chinese government does this a lot.

437
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,859
In China, apps like Facebook and YouTube are banned.

438
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:26,487
But they can access these by using NordVPN.

439
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:29,548
On top of it, it also protects your online privacy

440
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:31,826
because it hides your IP address.

441
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:33,616
And their latest feature is that

442
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:35,806
they provide a virtual server even in India.

443
00:18:35,806 --> 00:18:37,803
So, people living outside India

444
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:41,299
can now spoof their location 
pretending to be in India.

445
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:43,451
Since NordVPN has sponsored this video,

446
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:45,296
you will get a huge discount

447
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:47,333
plus 4 additional months for free

448
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,347
if you use my link,

449
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:51,315
nordvpn.com/dhruv

450
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:53,484
You can find the link in the description below.

451
00:18:53,484 --> 00:18:54,676
It's risk-free.

452
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,886
Because of NordVPN's 30-day money-back guarantee.

453
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:01,001
So, you can try it by going to 
NordVPN.com/Dhruv

454
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:02,301
Now, let's get back to the topic.

455
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:03,959
Today, in North India,

456
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:06,635
what is the economic viability of farming,

457
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:08,504
let's understand it with a real-life example.

458
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:11,445
In my family, among my relatives, 
many are still engaged in farming.

459
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:13,572
So, the example I will show,

460
00:19:13,572 --> 00:19:16,403
is prepared with the information given by my uncle.

461
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:18,854
I talked to him in detail and understood

462
00:19:18,854 --> 00:19:20,746
the exact expenses on everything

463
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:22,403
and the profit he gets.

464
00:19:22,403 --> 00:19:26,309
You can see this Excel file with calculations on screen.

465
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:32,085
This shows the economic viability 
of millet farming in Haryana.

466
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:33,927
The second chart you are seeing

467
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:35,573
basically divides everything into two parts.

468
00:19:35,573 --> 00:19:38,408
On the left side, if you farm like a business,

469
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:42,431
you rent land and hire people to work in your fields,

470
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,665
in such cases, the biggest expense you will bear

471
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:46,745
is of manpower at 57%.

472
00:19:46,745 --> 00:19:49,465
Tractor rent is 7% and land rent is 31%.

473
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:53,393
In this case, you will incur a loss 
of around ₹20,000 per acre.

474
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,308
So, this business model is a failure.

475
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:56,477
The second case is when,

476
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:58,046
you own the land

477
00:19:58,046 --> 00:19:59,118
and you are farming it yourself,

478
00:19:59,118 --> 00:20:01,376
then the biggest expense is water and seeds.

479
00:20:01,376 --> 00:20:05,784
In such cases, you can earn a profit of around ₹34,000 per acre.

480
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:07,486
This is for a year.

481
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:11,792
But if a farmer has to manage 
his family's expenses respectively,

482
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:13,849
then ₹34,000 in a year is absolutely nothing.

483
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:16,406
Here, he should make at least ₹2 lakh in annual profits.

484
00:20:16,406 --> 00:20:18,120
So, even in the second case,

485
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,453
for this business model to work,

486
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,536
a farmer should own at least 3 acres of land.

487
00:20:23,536 --> 00:20:25,364
Looking at this, you should get an idea of

488
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:27,355
how difficult farming is today.

489
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:30,513
This calculation was for millets.

490
00:20:30,513 --> 00:20:34,527
But this profit margin increases for rice crops.

491
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:36,356
In this case, as you can see on the screen,

492
00:20:36,356 --> 00:20:39,019
the profit per acre is ₹48,000 per year,

493
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:40,436
if the farmer owns the land.

494
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:43,407
And if it is done as a business, by taking the land on lease,

495
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:45,940
it is possible to make some profit.

496
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,807
Approximately ₹3,000 per acre per year in profits.

497
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:50,615
Two things are clearly evident with this.

498
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:53,614
First, farmers who own less than 3 acres of land

499
00:20:53,614 --> 00:20:56,510
find it extremely difficult to survive.

500
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,077
This is why in many states,

501
00:20:58,077 --> 00:20:59,735
farmers have given up farming

502
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:02,003
and now work as labourers or are unemployed.

503
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:04,336
Only the farmers who own a lot of land

504
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:05,804
are able to earn a good profit.

505
00:21:05,804 --> 00:21:09,180
Second, this shows the importance of MSP.

506
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,136
Looking at the market price, if grains like 
millet are not profitable for the farmers,

507
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:15,115
then farmers will not grow millet.

508
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:17,208
Only those grains will be preferred,

509
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,293
that can bring them higher profits,

510
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:21,115
leading to environmental damage.

511
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,640
More water will have to be used

512
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,118
and our health will suffer too.

513
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:25,450
Because grains like millet

514
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,283
are actually better for health,

515
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:29,711
compared to rice and wheat.

516
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:31,892
It is equally important to mention that

517
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:33,452
according to the Swaminathan report,

518
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:36,252
MSP was not the only safety net for farmers.

519
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:38,019
That report also mentioned that

520
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:39,978
to empower farmers,

521
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:43,361
we need to build more than 50,000 
farm schools all over the country.

522
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:46,232
Farmers should be taught new ways of innovation.

523
00:21:46,232 --> 00:21:48,277
Knowledge should lead their empowerment.

524
00:21:48,277 --> 00:21:50,846
The second report of the Swaminathan Committe stated that

525
00:21:50,846 --> 00:21:54,274
villages should have food grain banks to prepare for natural calamities.

526
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,717
We saw the COVID-19 pandemic,

527
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,852
and how there were some people who starved to de@th.

528
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,092
M.S. Swaminathan was a visionary man.

529
00:22:02,092 --> 00:22:05,925
He knew that any natural calamity could happen at any time,

530
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,299
and food grain banks are essential to protect ourselves from it.

531
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:11,627
In his report, he appreciated Odisha's culture.

532
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:14,027
In Odisha, it is cultural

533
00:22:14,027 --> 00:22:16,112
to see seed banks in villages.

534
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:18,310
It is actually the Ministry of Agriculture's job

535
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:22,353
to help in the establishment of rural 
godowns, warehouses, and coal storage.

536
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:26,224
And then the use of this infrastructure 
should be subsidised for hill farmers.

537
00:22:26,224 --> 00:22:27,190
But, oh no!

538
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,629
If this happens, how will PM Modi's friend 
Gautam Adani run his business?

539
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:33,435
In a previous video, I talked about how

540
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,524
in 2021, there was an incident

541
00:22:35,524 --> 00:22:41,362
where Gautam Adani's company paid only ₹12 per kg of apples.

542
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:44,306
It was lower than the cost of production.

543
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:46,269
The maximum that their company paid

544
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:47,666
was ₹72 per kilo

545
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,406
for premium 100% colour apples.

546
00:22:50,406 --> 00:22:55,177
And these apples were later sold for ₹250 per kilo in the market.

547
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:57,619
A farmer, Dimple Panjta, told The Wire how

548
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:02,308
Adani had bought A-grade apples 
for ₹65 per kilo in 2011.

549
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:07,344
Ten years later, they paid only ₹7 per kilo more to buy those apples.

550
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,464
Why is this so?

551
00:23:08,464 --> 00:23:10,352
Because, according to the Swaminathan report,

552
00:23:10,352 --> 00:23:13,666
the sufficient cold storage facilities that 
were supposed to be built for the farmers,

553
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:14,646
were never built.

554
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:17,630
If the farmers do not have the right conditions for storage,

555
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,994
they will either have to sell their produce

556
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:21,855
or else, the apples would rot.

557
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,553
Many farmers across the country 
are blackmailed like this.

558
00:23:25,553 --> 00:23:27,715
Dimple Panjta also said that

559
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:29,906
his NGO found out how Adani

560
00:23:29,906 --> 00:23:32,562
was sold the land at dirt cheap prices,

561
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:35,410
in many places in the Shimla district,

562
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,817
to build three cold storage centres.

563
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,956
Now can you understand the struggles 
faced by the farmers in our country?

564
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:45,089
Today, the government has awarded M. S. Swaminathan with a Bharat Ratna.

565
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:49,451
But if a farmer talks about implementing the Swaminathan report,

566
00:23:49,451 --> 00:23:50,774
then their voice is suppressed.

567
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:53,211
They are attacked with tear gas.

568
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:54,897
And what does the media do in all this?

569
00:23:54,897 --> 00:23:57,519
The media tries to defame the farmers.

570
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,036
These TV news anchors

571
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:01,342
spread propaganda against the farmers.

572
00:24:01,342 --> 00:24:04,466
Fake news about them being Khalistanis,

573
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:05,861
and traitors are run.

574
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,508
Sometimes they claim that the farmers' 
demand will be the end of the Indian economy.

575
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:10,936
I will talk about this in a moment,

576
00:24:10,936 --> 00:24:12,062
but think about it.

577
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:14,080
When the farmers are not actively protesting,

578
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,714
how many times does the media talk about the farmers?

579
00:24:16,714 --> 00:24:19,132
When the farmers commit su!cide every day,

580
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:22,907
when they are forced to sell onions for ₹2 per kilo,

581
00:24:22,907 --> 00:24:25,009
how many debates are organised by these news channels?

582
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,499
YouTuber Ramit Verma analysed 202 debates 
on four Hindi news channels.

583
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:31,869
Aaj Tak, News18, Zee News, and India TV

584
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:34,183
out of these 202 prime-time debates

585
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:36,673
how many debates were on farmers

586
00:24:36,673 --> 00:24:38,221
and the unemployed youth?

587
00:24:38,221 --> 00:24:39,190
Zero.

588
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,354
Absolutely zero.

589
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,437
Agriculture expert P. Sainath says that

590
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:45,827
69% of our country's population still lives in villages.

591
00:24:45,827 --> 00:24:48,758
But what is the share of news from rural India

592
00:24:48,758 --> 00:24:50,247
on the front page of newspapers?

593
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:52,526
Only 0.67%.

594
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:54,347
During the last farmers' protest,

595
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:57,682
5,072 news stories were published in 5 months.

596
00:24:57,682 --> 00:25:01,121
Out of those, only 0.7% news stories were about 

597
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:04,177
the increasing cost of production.

598
00:25:04,177 --> 00:25:09,033
Only 27% even mentioned the demand for MSP.

599
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:11,722
So when farmers are dying or going through rough times,

600
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:13,545
the media remains silent.

601
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,829
But as soon as they raise their voice

602
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:17,097
to get an MSP,

603
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:19,834
a minimum price for them to barely live on,

604
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:22,273
these TV channels begin their propaganda.

605
00:25:22,273 --> 00:25:23,713
One YouTuber said that

606
00:25:23,713 --> 00:25:25,948
if the government gave in to the 
farmers' demands and implemented MSP,

607
00:25:25,948 --> 00:25:28,745
then it will cost us ₹10 Trillion!

608
00:25:28,745 --> 00:25:30,988
Another said it would be ₹18 trillion.

609
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,494
They lie so much that

610
00:25:32,494 --> 00:25:35,428
the news article they use while lying,

611
00:25:35,428 --> 00:25:37,830
catches them in their lie in the same second.

612
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,782
"Rs 10 lakh crore [₹10 Trillion] is misinformation" 

613
00:25:40,782 --> 00:25:43,068
First, the MSP that is being given now

614
00:25:43,068 --> 00:25:44,583
and the new MSP that is demanded,

615
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:47,891
only the difference between the two should be considered

616
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:49,560
to calculate the extra money spent by the government.

617
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,831
According to a CRISIL study,

618
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:55,208
which examined 16 out of 23 crops with an MSP,

619
00:25:55,208 --> 00:26:00,074
they estimate that the real cost of legalising MSP

620
00:26:00,074 --> 00:26:02,337
will be only around ₹210 billion

621
00:26:02,337 --> 00:26:04,660
for the marketing year 2023.

622
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,070
Second, agriculture expert Devinder Sharma states that

623
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,209
the government doesn't buy everything from the farmers.

624
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,437
The government buys produce on MSP only when

625
00:26:13,437 --> 00:26:15,303
the market prices crash.

626
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:17,681
The main burden of buying at MSP

627
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:18,997
will be on the private players.

628
00:26:18,997 --> 00:26:20,755
According to the Swaminathan report,

629
00:26:20,755 --> 00:26:23,349
MSP should be applied to private companies as well.

630
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,745
So if someone has to bear the expenses,

631
00:26:25,745 --> 00:26:29,409
it is the middlemen, corporate companies 
who are already earning millions.

632
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:33,374
And what is the issue with them paying 
a minimum support price to the farmers,

633
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:36,454
when similar laws already exist in other industries?

634
00:26:36,454 --> 00:26:38,742
When a company hires an employee,

635
00:26:38,742 --> 00:26:41,888
does the minimum wage law apply or not?

636
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:46,101
Similarly, when a company buys produce from a farmer,

637
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:48,376
a minimum support price law can be applicable.

638
00:26:48,892 --> 00:26:50,640
Now, someone might say that

639
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,949
this goes against the principles of the free market.

640
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:55,164
How can a government impose such regulations?

641
00:26:55,164 --> 00:26:57,944
We should have a free market.

642
00:26:57,944 --> 00:26:59,278
But I would like to ask you,

643
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:02,393
when Adani buys apples for ₹12 per kg from the farmers,

644
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:03,680
is this a free market?

645
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,143
When rules are changed

646
00:27:05,143 --> 00:27:07,612
and 6 airports are given to Adani on a serving tray,

647
00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:09,066
is this a free market?

648
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:10,705
The white revolution in India

649
00:27:10,705 --> 00:27:12,369
didn't happen because of the free market.

650
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:14,499
It happened due to the Government's protectionism.

651
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,135
It happened because of the milk cooperatives.

652
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,894
I talked about this in the video on Amul.

653
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,971
People hear the phrase 'free market'

654
00:27:21,971 --> 00:27:22,928
and start using it.

655
00:27:22,928 --> 00:27:25,409
Before using such heavy words,

656
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:28,268
people should understand the philosophy of Adam Smith.

657
00:27:28,268 --> 00:27:30,930
David Ricardo, Labour theory, Karl Marx,

658
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,300
John Maynard Keynes.

659
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,894
Only after understanding these,

660
00:27:33,894 --> 00:27:37,775
should one make an opinion about 
what free market is and what it is not.

661
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:40,898
You don't have to understand all these complexities.

662
00:27:40,898 --> 00:27:42,214
Just watch this video.

663
00:27:42,214 --> 00:27:44,732
"I bought this for ₹25,

664
00:27:44,732 --> 00:27:46,628
there's 100 grams of corn.

665
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:48,779
How much did the farmers make?

666
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:52,852
If they sell 100g of corn for ₹25,

667
00:27:52,852 --> 00:27:54,672
they should have been insanely rich.

668
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,853
But no,

669
00:27:55,853 --> 00:27:57,327
that doesn't happen.

670
00:27:57,602 --> 00:27:59,531
The reality is different."

671
00:27:59,531 --> 00:28:01,596
This is such a simple concept

672
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,344
shared by Facebook user Priyanka Singh.

673
00:28:03,344 --> 00:28:05,009
She calls herself a farmer's daughter.

674
00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:07,616
She bought a 100g packet of sweet corn.

675
00:28:07,616 --> 00:28:09,175
It was priced at Rs. 25.

676
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:12,536
This means that 1 kg of sweet corn costs ₹250.

677
00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:16,078
Now, how much does a farmer get out of this ₹250?

678
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:18,663
We discussed MSP in this video.

679
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,594
If MSP is applied,

680
00:28:20,594 --> 00:28:23,108
the farmer will get ₹21 per kg.

681
00:28:23,108 --> 00:28:27,590
Out of ₹250, we are talking about only ₹21 per kg.

682
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:31,698
Even after implementing MSP, 
the farmer will get only this amount.

683
00:28:31,698 --> 00:28:33,406
That is, the middleman

684
00:28:33,406 --> 00:28:35,486
will still keep about ₹230 out of it.

685
00:28:35,486 --> 00:28:38,980
Is it wrong for the farmer to get 
even this minimum price?

686
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,690
It's your turn, share your opinion in the comment below.

687
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,221
If you liked this video, then watch this video too,

688
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,922
in which I have explained how the government

689
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:48,766
is manipulating the laws for other industries,

690
00:28:48,766 --> 00:28:52,357
just to benefit their crony capitalist friends.

691
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:54,158
It might be shocking for you.
