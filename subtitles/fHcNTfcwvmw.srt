00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,308
 Today I went to Tech Burner's studio.

2
00:00:02,308 --> 00:00:05,468
 Bro, the studio is so big that 
 we had to use hoverboard here,

3
00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:07,282
 to go from one side to another.

4
00:00:07,283 --> 00:00:10,457
 Then on the way I saw Tech 
 Burner's 5 lakh rupees dog.

5
00:00:10,457 --> 00:00:12,000
 It had a camera in its nose.

6
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:13,466
 It had too many 
sensors in the mouth.

7
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:15,668
 And brother, it was showing 
 it by doing different tricks.

8
00:00:15,668 --> 00:00:17,163
And this is the first dog in my life

9
00:00:17,163 --> 00:00:19,803
whom I slapped and it 
did not bite me, poor dog.

10
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:22,903
 Then I saw this red camera 
 which is usually used in movies.

11
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:25,198
 To lift it, first I had to make 
 body with dumbbells,

12
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:26,267
 because it was too heavy.

13
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:28,058
 Even its price was equally heavy.

14
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:29,043
 Rs.6.5 lakh.

15
00:00:29,043 --> 00:00:32,368
 And this 100TB server was to 
 keep the big footage of this.

16
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:36,000
 Then I did the first collab of my life, 
 with Tech Burner.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,442
 Overall I learned a lot, 
 and had a lot of fun.

18
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:39,604
 One more thing is too fun,

19
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:41,558
 that's the subscribe button of "mosttechy".
