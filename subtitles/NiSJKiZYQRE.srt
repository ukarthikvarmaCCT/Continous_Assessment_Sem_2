1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,834
God has written so much travel in my life.

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,119
We didn't even reach home
properly from Hong Kong.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,207
That we had to leave for
Mumbai again tomorrow morning.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,720
Yes, brother.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,199
Put on your shoes quickly.

6
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:16,719
Hurry up, we have to go pick up sister.

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,009
Pihu and I are going to pick up Rashi Didi.

8
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:20,523
Ritu and Preetu are
going for something else.

9
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:21,348
Hurry up.

10
00:00:21,838 --> 00:00:23,940
Don't know what happened
to Pihu today at 1 o'clock,

11
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:25,972
Sister, Sister, Sister

12
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:28,128
How does she know that it's
time for elder sister to came.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,760
Today we made Pihu wear other shoes.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,539
Today shoes won't drop,

15
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:34,412
Who gave you this gift today?

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,959
This is our house's gift

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,861
Is this your house's gift?

18
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:38,654
Yes

19
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,390
Yes Let's go.

20
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:41,704
I don't want to go home.

21
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,605
She is having fun, she
doesn't want to go home

22
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,900
Pihu, do you want to go home or not?

23
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:46,729
Finally, our Lala ji move ahead.

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,639
Hurry up, let's go home.

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,960
I have brought a very
nice gift for both of you

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,479
Let's go, let's go

27
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,549
Didn't you get chocolate from school today?

28
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:52,639
No one had a birthday.

29
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:55,630
It's 6.30 in the evening, I
have taken a bath and got ready

30
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,889
So now we are going to worship God.

31
00:00:56,914 --> 00:00:57,986
Today is Monday.

32
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:00,437
So we are going to worship, I
said let's keep Lord Shiva's fast.

33
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,677
Let's worship God and then
we will start eating.

34
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:03,326
After that, we will go to the gym.

35
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:12,797
Rashi's class is going on.

36
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:17,586
Welcome back to the vlog
We have just left for Mumbai.

37
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:18,799
And there is so much travel in life

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,778
I don't feel like it, but if there is
work then it has to be done, bro.

39
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,850
We have reached Mumbai airport.

40
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,319
In Delhi in the morning,
everyone travels by DIGI Yatra.

41
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,534
So in DIGI Yatra, I scanned by
outside the airport automatically.

42
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:33,362
They don't check the
ID, it's already checked.

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,338
So there was no crowd outside the airport.

44
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:38,239
As soon as I went inside,
the security belt DIGI yatra didn't work.

45
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,762
It was empty outside and crowded inside.

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,680
Anyway, we are not going by taxi today.

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,610
We will take an auto.

48
00:01:42,844 --> 00:01:45,050
Because the taxi will take me
to where i want to go in an hour.

49
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,785
From here the auto will take
me in 15 minutes.

50
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,272
The metro will take 15
minutes more ahead from there.

51
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,719
It's raining here, I bring
an umbrella from Delhi.

52
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,445
Ritu says i am crazy,
but it from Mumbai itself.

53
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,730
I didn't an umbrella from Mumbai.

54
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,417
When it doesn't rain, I think
if I leave it now, it will stop.

55
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:57,269
I will take it later.

56
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,106
Then it starts raining, I
think how can I take it now

57
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,737
It's raining now, I can't even
go out to buy an umbrella.

58
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,239
So I get stuck in that loop.

59
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,040
That's why I wanted to
take an umbrella from Delhi.

60
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:06,848
You have to come here to get an
auto, you don't get an auto from above.

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,869
We have reached Airport
Road Metro, This is the right thing here.

62
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,360
Oh, I left this.

63
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,879
This is such a nice bag.

64
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,966
This was sent by YouTube,
I made an unboxing of it.

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,759
Dude, YouTube used to
send a lot of stuff before.

66
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,439
There used to be YouTube
FanFest, Creators Meet.

67
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,639
 Meta used to do it, but I
don't know about YouTube.

68
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,847
I mean, since Covid happened,

69
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:30,216
YouTube is like.

70
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,310
Literally, do you see how
empty Mumbai Metro is.

71
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,201
This is a culture habit
for the people of Delhi.

72
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,822
I can't even think of
traveling in Delhi Metro.

73
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:39,802
I know some people will say
that there is no time, it's 11 o'clock

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,116
Dude, there is no time for Delhi
Metro, there are crowds everywhere.

75
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:44,399
This is the ticket counter,
omly two girls are waiting.

76
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,039
Bro, there is not a single
person on the metro.

77
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:49,652
Look at this.

78
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:53,199
It's 11.30 am, we have
reached our destination.

79
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,839
We will work here till
10 pm and then go home.

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,285
If you come to Mumbai, do
bring this, otherwise don't come.

81
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,434
The work is done, we took
an auto and went home.

82
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,745
My house is a little far
from here,

83
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,428
but I told the auto driver to drop me here

84
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:07,249
Because it's impossible to
live in Mumbai without eating Pani Puri.

85
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,169
 We have reached home, it's 10 pm.

86
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,949
Where did my bag go?

87
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,453
I did bring my bag.

88
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:14,705
I have ordered food,
the food is almost here.

89
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:17,255
 Let's take this bag out, it work is here.

90
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,559
Let's take this inside.

91
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:23,102
Welcome back, it's 3.30 pm

92
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:24,133
I have been working since
morning,

93
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:26,081
I am getting up a little
late I took a little chill.

94
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:27,889
This is my breakfast, lunch and everything.

95
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,579
I have done one job,
now I have to do the other.

96
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:31,486
But bro, I have to praise the city.

97
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,030
It rains so much here, but
still work doesn't stop.

98
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
Everyone does their work.

99
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,520
But here people have learned
how to work even in the rain.

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,896
I mean, if you are ordering
food, it is also coming on time.

101
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,234
If you are ordering groceries
from any app, it is also coming on time.

102
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,279
Everyone has learned how to live.

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,479
We still have problems.

104
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,857
It rains so much that
we are sitting at home

105
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,243
Making tea, fritters, holiday, rainy day.

106
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,166
But it's not like that here

107
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,855
Bro, so much time is
wasted in ordering food.

108
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,289
I am still watching, I don't
understand what to eat.

109
00:03:58,367 --> 00:03:59,655
 I think I praised too much.

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,430
My order was an hour ago,
now my order is canceled.

111
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,580
I am starving to death.

112
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,841
Bro, it's been raining since morning.

113
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,319
Let's go out and see if we
can find something to eat.

114
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,119
If we get tea and biscuits, it will be fun.

115
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:13,303
Finally, the food has
arrived, let's eat a little.

116
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:15,335
I have ordered simple
food, I have ordered Khichdi.

117
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,644
We are editing something and
shooting something at the same time,

118
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:18,830
 This is the condition of the room.

119
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,036
Bro, it's 11 o'clock in the night.

120
00:04:21,036 --> 00:04:22,456
It's still raining.

121
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:24,216
I couldn't even go to the gym.

122
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:27,519
I mean, I could go, but I
couldn't, take an umbrella this far.

123
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,146
It's not like that, it's
an excuse of the rain.

124
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,500
But it's amazing, bro, it's raining.

125
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,560
Bro, at 2 o'clock in the
morning, finally work is over.

126
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,752
But I am very hungry right now
No delivery will come at this time.

127
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,110
But for the betterment of
man, man is useful to man.

128
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,125
This is Airbnb, I mean, it's an apartment.

129
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,310
The people who were living
before me must have bought Maggi

130
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:44,154
But they couldn't eat it,

131
00:04:44,304 --> 00:04:45,255
 they left it.

132
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,225
Good luck to that person.

133
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,810
Bro, I am eating Maggi after so many years.

134
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,322
Maybe I ate it in the lockdown
After that,

135
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:50,632
how small will the Maggi packets be.

136
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,124
Bro, the packet in which the
Maggi was in, look at the insect in it.

137
00:04:54,215 --> 00:04:55,814
Should I eat it or not, I
don't understand, man.

138
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,879
I am very hungry.

139
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:58,136
Isn't there any insect in it?

140
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,319
I can't see it in it, then it's okay.

141
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,319
We make Maggi and it is made in 2 minutes.

142
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,118
I said, we have 2 minutes left
Let's fix the face of the room, bro.

143
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:10,910
What I am doing, you guys don't do it.

144
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:12,934
 Don't eat Maggi at night.

145
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,026
Now people will say that
you are eating brother, you don't do it.

146
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:16,301
 Bro, you watch my vlog and tell me.

147
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,839
When did I eat Maggi last time?

148
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,918
The person who told
me, showed it in the vlog.

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,880
I will give him a reward.

150
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,799
Welcome back, day number 3

151
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,060
We are leaving for work in Mumbai.

152
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,580
Yesterday, I had a holiday in a way

153
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:26,339
I didn't do anything yesterday.

154
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:27,519
I mean, I did it at
home, I didn't go there.

155
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,300
Today I am going from here.

156
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,509
Today is the day to go out.

157
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,779
It's still raining, I have an umbrella.

158
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,532
That's why we are leaving.

159
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,781
I am getting my Uber
booked quickly, auto.

160
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:36,178
When you book an auto,
it shows in 1 minute away.

161
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,256
And it's been 10 minutes now,
he hasn't booked anything yet

162
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:41,558
Bro, my auto is here.

163
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:52,313
I have come back to the same metro
from where I started in the morning.

164
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:54,250
It's 10 o'clock at night, I
just need to get the auto.

165
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,649
Auto! It stopped.

166
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:57,145
That's it, get me off.

167
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:57,782
Thank you.

168
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,458
The tiredness of the
whole day vanishes.

169
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:01,379
When we come here, we eat our Sev Puri.

170
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,234
Today, brother will make
something different and feed us.

171
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:04,902
He is making Bhel Puri instead of Sev Puri.

172
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:07,106
Today we will eat Bhel Puri.

173
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:10,068
Bro, there has been a huge loss.

174
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:11,906
The auto in which we came,
the umbrella got left in that auto.

175
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:15,105
In a city like Mumbai, living without
an umbrella It's impossible, bro.

176
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:15,933
bro, I will have to order
a new one tomorrow.

177
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:17,040
Now, what's the point
of buying an umbrella?

178
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,201
I will go in the morning,
it will be raining at that time.

179
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:20,741
God should stop the rain for
those who want to buy an umbrella.

180
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:22,239
Once you buy an umbrella,
let it rain again, God.

181
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,729
But no.

182
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:24,505
Welcome back home.

183
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:26,344
No matter what I say,
it's fun to come home.

184
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:29,688
Hey guys, welcome back
to the vlog It's morning now.

185
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,814
I am telling you, last night
I slept after drinking tea.

186
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,982
So here is a cup of tea.

187
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:33,800
There was no tea in it.

188
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,620
There was only a tea bag.

189
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,744
There was a little tea in the tea bag.

190
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:37,322
I woke up in the morning
and there were insects here.

191
00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:39,147
 When it rains, the sun doesn't come out.

192
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:40,830
Insects terrorize people, bro.

193
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:44,048
There was no food, there was nothing
There was only tea in the tea bag.

194
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:45,467
There was a light tea in the
cup, there were two drops,

195
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:46,215
It was left in the tea bag.

196
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,040
There were insects in it.

197
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,239
The sun doesn't come out.

198
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,220
I don't know how long it's been.

199
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,009
Even if the sun doesn't come out.

200
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,436
Bro, there are insects here.

201
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:54,292
So I have made coffee now.
Let's enjoy coffee with Mop.

202
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,269
Cheers Mop.

203
00:06:55,294 --> 00:06:56,590
I ordered a new umbrella today.

204
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,790
New Hey New Umbrella.

205
00:06:57,889 --> 00:06:59,253
The Uber driver went ahead.

206
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:00,336
I thought he left today.

207
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:01,865
It's raining heavily, bro

208
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,881
This is normal for people.

209
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:04,040
I have reached the metro station.

210
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,019
My whole life has been like this.

211
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,276
Home, auto, metro, work

212
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:08,800
Without a metro, auto, home.

213
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,361
But I can't go to gym, don't know why.

214
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,146
I have become used to it,

215
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:12,482
I don't know what will happen to me.

216
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,615
But there is a big
advantage of doing a job.

217
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,239
That you will never waste your time

218
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,439
Because you have to
go to the office every day.

219
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,399
So if you are going to the office.

220
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:20,040
 Then the boss will give you some work.

221
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,328
So when you work for yourself.

222
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:23,075
Sometimes it happens I
haven't done anything in the day.

223
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,040
It's a non-productive day.

224
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,891
When you do a job,

225
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:26,898
So there is no non-productive day.

226
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:28,610
Which is what I like about when i go.

227
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:29,415
When I come to work,

228
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,149
I have to go to the office If
I have to do work, then it's fun.

229
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:33,019
But yes, I have the
liberty to set my own time.

230
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,944
I will have so much fun today.

231
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,870
I have that.

232
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:36,776
Let's drink tea.

233
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,352
Bad luck, didn't get the tea.

234
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,308
I mean they didn't have without sugar.

235
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:39,639
He was making it.

236
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:40,439
I said I'll come later.

237
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,440
But the biscuits in the tea stall.

238
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:43,920
They are so crunchy, it's so good.

239
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:44,960
I enjoy in eating them.

240
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,896
Just stop it here.

241
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:46,656
Thank you

242
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,682
Back from work

243
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,340
Same old place

244
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:49,165
Today i don't forget the umbrella.

245
00:07:49,892 --> 00:07:50,829
Let's get up.

246
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:52,013
Let's start the work.

247
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:56,496
What's up guys

248
00:07:56,521 --> 00:07:57,239
Welcome back

249
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,777
Today is our last day in Mumbai.

250
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:00,369
Let's start the morning routine.

251
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:01,950
Let's heat the water and drink.

252
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,845
This is my third trip to Mumbai
in the last month and a half.

253
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,560
But the same condition I was in on day 1.

254
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:14,133
The same condition I am
in on day 5.

255
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,221
Non-stop rain.

256
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:18,518
Brother, I drank water.

257
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:19,661
Let's do our morning routine.

258
00:08:19,686 --> 00:08:21,560
I have been doing in my morning
routine one thing for 3-4 days.

259
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,830
Because if you do it
too it will help you a lot.

260
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:25,577
Brother, there is nothing much to break.

261
00:08:25,648 --> 00:08:26,624
Like what you have to do is,

262
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,172
You have to sit, Full squat down.

263
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,318
Indian style.

264
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:31,457
In the Shit position,

265
00:08:31,482 --> 00:08:32,253
Like this.

266
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,221
Everywhere in our house has become western.

267
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:36,919
 I forgot to sit in this position.

268
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,958
There is a lot of benefit
in sitting in this position.

269
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:40,977
Your digestive tract will be fine.

270
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,850
Your pancreas will work well.

271
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:44,205
But why do I sit?

272
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:46,117
I sit in the lower back

273
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:47,890
When I wake up in the
morning my waist is stiff.

274
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:49,639
This disgestive system will be fine.

275
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,534
This will be fine.

276
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,301
You will get to know the effects slowly.

277
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,109
But the stiffness of the lower back.

278
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:55,442
Sit for 5 minutes

279
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:57,092
You will get to know at that time.

280
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:57,681
So what happens

281
00:08:57,706 --> 00:08:58,169
What I do is

282
00:08:58,194 --> 00:08:59,822
I round my spine.

283
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,140
Because your spine is round,

284
00:09:01,238 --> 00:09:01,904
So I do this.

285
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,837
And I do this

286
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,169
So my whole spine is decompressed.

287
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:06,522
So your spine is like this

288
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:08,873
So even I sleep wrongly.

289
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:10,398
And my weakness is that

290
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:12,536
I sleep on my stomach,

291
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:13,568
You shouldn't sleep like that

292
00:09:13,593 --> 00:09:14,926
You should sleep sideways or frontways.

293
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:16,382
But i turn myself in the night.

294
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:18,167
My spine is completely compressed

295
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:19,444
I sit all day.

296
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,748
There is work on the table.

297
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:22,114
The spine is compressed

298
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:22,913
So you must have seen.

299
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,205
Some people hang upside
down and some do Pilates.

300
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:26,618
To decompress the spine.

301
00:09:26,673 --> 00:09:27,811
So this is a good position

302
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:28,861
To decompress the spine

303
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,457
You sit in this position for 5 minutes

304
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:30,989
That's it

305
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:32,271
I have massaged a lot.

306
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:35,153
Mama Earth has launched new
Rose merry, Now let's go for a bath.

307
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:35,637
And leave

308
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,189
Today I have a check out from this house.

309
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:37,778
Bye bye

310
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:39,178
Time to say bye bye to this house.

311
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:39,804
- Bye Aftab

312
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:40,360
- Bye

313
00:09:41,002 --> 00:09:41,800
Day number 5,

314
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:42,586
Same place,

315
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:43,358
Same metro.

316
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:45,156
Today I am going to work a little early.

317
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:46,888
Because I will leave early
in the evening from the office.

318
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:48,961
The aim is to take this umbrella to Delhi.

319
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,415
I don't want to lose it I have tug it here.

320
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:52,440
The day I was last in Mumbai.

321
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:54,298
I have a slight cold

322
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:55,196
I have a sore throat it happens.

323
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:58,107
Means going to Delhi i will
take a sore throat from here.

324
00:09:58,132 --> 00:09:59,702
I have lost my ticket.

325
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:03,602
Thank you sir.

326
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:05,470
We spent 110 rupees.

327
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:05,886
Let's go.

328
00:10:06,704 --> 00:10:07,477
Came back here.

329
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,084
Mumbai trip is over.

330
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:12,000
We are going back.

331
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,632
We are going by metro and
take the auto to the airport.

332
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:15,093
Thankfully, it's not raining this time.

333
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:16,496
- Should i get down here
- Yes sir

334
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:19,911
After spending 5 days in Mumbai,
it's time for me to go back home.

335
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:21,441
I was very late.

336
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,862
I'm tired. I landed to Delhi late at night.

337
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:26,020
But I'm happy that I'll go
home and see my kids.

338
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:30,136
