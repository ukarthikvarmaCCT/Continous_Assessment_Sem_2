1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:00,967
(dramatic music)
- [Jimmy] The last team

2
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:03,603
to leave this rollercoaster wins $20,000.

3
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:05,338
Chris and Chandler are team captains.

4
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,941
Chris is the blue team, and
Chandler is the white team.

5
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:08,908
(bell dings)
Chandler's team is sitting

6
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:09,909
in the front.

7
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:10,777
(bell dings)
Chris's team is sitting

8
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:11,611
in the back.

9
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,579
Chandler, are you guys gonna win?

10
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,980
- Go team.

11
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,814
- [Jimmy] Gotcha.

12
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:15,648
Are you gonna win?

13
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:16,483
- Yes.
- Of course.

14
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:17,417
- Yep, yes.
- Yes.

15
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,251
- [Jimmy] You sure, Chris?
- 100%.

16
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,085
- [Jimmy] Let's see it.

17
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,453
All right, fire up the rollercoaster.

18
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,454
Send them off.

19
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:22,288
- [Contestant] Yeah!

20
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,456
- Here we go.
(hands clapping)

21
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,791
- [Jimmy] All right, guys.

22
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,859
(contestants cheering)

23
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,862
$20,000 on the line.
(cash register rings)

24
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,766
Chris, 20 grand, think
of what you could buy.

25
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,001
- [Tareq] This is never gonna end.

26
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:35,902
- No.

27
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,804
Whoa!

28
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:38,638
- Oh.

29
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:39,472
- Okay.

30
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:40,807
- I feel it.

31
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:41,641
That's crazy.

32
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,443
(rollercoaster rumbling)

33
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,711
- Yeah.

34
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,279
Great jerk up.

35
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,448
(Chandler laughing)

36
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,916
(hands clapping)

37
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:50,750
(Jake laughing)

38
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,318
- [Jimmy] All right, guys,
your first lap just finished.

39
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,153
How did it feel?
(hands clapping)

40
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,287
- Fantastic.
- Great.

41
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:55,121
- Fantastic.
- Awesome.

42
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:55,955
- I don't like rollercoasters.

43
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:56,790
(Chandler laughing)

44
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,624
I get sick, so.

45
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,458
- [Jimmy] So, are you gonna
do two more laps, Chandler?

46
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,292
- I don't know, we'll see.

47
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,293
I might do like 10.

48
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,127
- [Jimmy] How was it, boys?

49
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:01,961
- It was really good.

50
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,130
We've figured out some
strategies how to win.

51
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,765
- [Jimmy] All right,
let's do lap number two.

52
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,967
Round two, boys, round two.
(hands clapping)

53
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,402
(rollercoaster whooshing)

54
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:13,239
(Ty imitating engine revving)

55
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,742
- I peed myself.

56
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,710
- My eyelash is coming out.

57
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,545
What's going on?

58
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,346
- I'm already sweating profusively.

59
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,882
- I decided to become the
cameraman for team blue.

60
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:23,850
How's it going, blue?

61
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,684
- It's going great.

62
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:25,819
We figured it out.

63
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:26,653
We're good.

64
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,722
(rollercoaster whirring)
(playful music)

65
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:30,590
- Ah, we stopped.

66
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,625
- Guys, this looks kind of similar.

67
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,227
(rollercoaster rattling)

68
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,028
- Hey, how you doing?

69
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,097
- Is it just me, or did it feel faster?

70
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,532
(contestants exclaiming)

71
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,569
- Chris, I agree, that felt
extremely faster than normal.

72
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,403
- It did, it feels way faster.

73
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,971
- [Jimmy] Ma'am, did
you speed that one up?

74
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,306
(sad music)

75
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,140
- [Tareq] One more time?

76
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,041
One more time?
- Stretch, stretch, stretch,

77
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:48,875
stretch, stretch-
- Again, again.

78
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,844
- Woo-hoo, we're going again.

79
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,746
(triumphant music)
(rollercoaster whooshing)

80
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:54,581
(rollercoaster rattling)

81
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,282
- All right, we're gonna go straight.

82
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,152
Go, go, go.

83
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,254
Lean left.

84
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,591
(contestants screaming)

85
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,061
That hurt, bro.

86
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:13,066
That hurt.
- Woo-hoo!

87
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,468
- Look, I'm gonna be the first
person to not have any joy

88
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,402
on a rollercoaster.

89
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,642
(triumphant music)

90
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,444
That was my joyless rollercoaster ride.

91
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,246
- [Jimmy] They're about
to go into lap number 10.

92
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,680
Jake, stop that.

93
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,515
How do you guys feel?

94
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,349
- I feel bad.

95
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,683
My butt cheek is hurting.

96
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:31,551
- [Jimmy] Which butt cheek?

97
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,452
- My left one.

98
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,286
- [Jimmy] That's fine.

99
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,120
You still have the right one.
- Mine too.

100
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,688
- [Jimmy] All right, we're
going into lap number 10.

101
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:36,523
(Marcus speaking faintly)
- [Jake] If I have

102
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,357
to crawl back there.

103
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,191
- [Jimmy] Are you guys good?

104
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:38,992
Yeah, please crawl back here.

105
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,826
- Yeah, come on back here, man.

106
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,127
- Please, please, come on.
- Come on.

107
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,328
- Come on.
- Come on, get out.

108
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,163
- [Jimmy] All right.

109
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:43,997
Ma'am, just start lap number 10

110
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,831
before they're all no longer friends.

111
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,566
(rollercoaster whooshes)

112
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,402
(tense rock music)
(Chris exclaiming)

113
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,803
(relaxing music)
- Carlos, you're doing great.

114
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:54,007
(tense rock music)
(Chris exclaiming)

115
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:54,807
(relaxing music)

116
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,942
- Ah, so bright.
(Dustin humming)

117
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,112
(tense rock music)
(Chris exclaiming)

118
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,046
- Whoo!

119
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,181
- Do you guys want a little break?

120
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,015
- [All] Yeah.

121
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,882
- Too bad.

122
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:03,716
Start it up.

123
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,551
- Wait, you said break.

124
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,818
You said break.
- [Jimmy] Sorry, have fun.

125
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,687
- [All] No!

126
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,856
(tense rock music)

127
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,491
- [Jimmy] Hey, welcome back, boys.

128
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,293
I hope you enjoy your two second stay.

129
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,127
Start it back up.

130
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,295
- [Contestant] Aw, man, come on.

131
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,129
- [Jimmy] All right.

132
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,431
- I'm gonna do my longest
yeah, boy, on a roller coaster.

133
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,265
- [Tareq] All right, go ahead.

134
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:20,600
- Yeah, boy.

135
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,101
- Boy.

136
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:27,073
(voices trilling)
(rollercoaster rumbling)

137
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,612
- (inhales deeply) Oh.

138
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,713
- [Jimmy] How many
challenges have you won?

139
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,581
- Technically, it's like three

140
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,883
or four 'cause I won two teams
and then two individuals.

141
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,884
- [Jimmy] How many have you won?

142
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,718
- Two.

143
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,552
- [Jimmy] How many have you won?

144
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,386
- One.
- [Jimmy] Wait,

145
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,221
which one did you win?

146
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,055
- Treadmill.
- [Jimmy] You did.

147
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,889
You haven't won one yet.

148
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,723
- No.

149
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,557
- [Jimmy] But this is a team of winners.

150
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,959
Even the cameraman here
didn't win anything.

151
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:46,793
- [Audience] Aw.

152
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:47,627
- [Jimmy] Sorry.

153
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,461
- The last one-

154
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,295
- [Jimmy] The Tesla still hurts.

155
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,196
Jake, how many challenges have you won?

156
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,030
- Two.

157
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,864
- [Jimmy] Bailey won the house.

158
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,166
Egg one was purely random.

159
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,000
You've won one.

160
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,001
Oh, you've won one, that's right.

161
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,035
So, you guys, two.

162
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,103
Have you won one?

163
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,037
- I haven't won anything.

164
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:58,871
- [Jimmy] Have you won one?

165
00:03:58,871 --> 00:03:59,706
- I haven't won anything.

166
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,673
- [Jimmy] They've won six challenges.

167
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,675
You guys have won two, and
one of the two was by chance.

168
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,509
I don't know, guys.

169
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,112
- Two of the people back there
have been able to compete

170
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,580
in more challenges though.

171
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,414
That's all I'm saying.

172
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,249
- [Jimmy] Oh, oh.

173
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,950
They said your win/loss is worse though.

174
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,518
- But we have more experience-

175
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,353
- [Jimmy] Okay.

176
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,255
(tense rock music)
(rollercoaster rumbling)

177
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,991
(body thwacking)

178
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,227
(contestants exclaiming)

179
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,428
(sad music)
- All right, I'm going, boys.

180
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,263
- No.

181
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,097
- Please.

182
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:24,931
- No.
- I can't.

183
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,766
- Chan-Chan looks sick up there.

184
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,702
(Chandler exhales sharply)

185
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:30,637
- [Jimmy] Wait, so what's wrong?

186
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,471
What's wrong?

187
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,372
- Just a bit dizzy.

188
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,773
You know I get motion
sick, and I'm done for now.

189
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,841
- [Jimmy] You're leaving the team?

190
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,542
Chandler, if you step out, you're out.

191
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,377
(contestants cheering)

192
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,211
(buzzer buzzes)

193
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,512
All right.

194
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,546
He's out.

195
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,581
Chandler is out.

196
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,483
That now leaves three
left for the white team.

197
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,317
- [Chandler] My butt fell asleep.

198
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,419
- [Jimmy] Chandler, you got out first.

199
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,253
- Yeah.

200
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,689
- [Jimmy] Do you feel bad
taking $5,000 if your team wins

201
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,523
for you?

202
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,292
- No, I told them I would only take three.

203
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,060
- [Jimmy] Oh, well, in that case.

204
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,228
In that case, you're a nice guy.

205
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,062
- Yeah.

206
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:56,896
They get like six.

207
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:57,730
That's a fair deal.

208
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,564
I picked the squad, you know?

209
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,732
I'm the coach.

210
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,566
- [Jimmy] And you're gonna
be there cheerleader, right?

211
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,401
- Yeah.

212
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,235
- [Jimmy] Okay.

213
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,202
So, how do you feel now
that Chandler left you?

214
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,037
- I'm great.

215
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:04,871
I got more room.

216
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,705
- [Jimmy] Chandler,
apparently there's kids

217
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,507
out there chanting you suck.

218
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,341
Let's go address it.

219
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,909
- Everyone was chanting Chandler sucks.

220
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:10,743
- Why would you-

221
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,577
- [Jimmy] Well, now he's right here.

222
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,712
Tell it to him to his face.

223
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,546
- It was her.

224
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,380
It was her idea.

225
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,381
- What?
- Chandler doesn't suck.

226
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,215
- I was-
- Chandler doesn't suck.

227
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,685
- [Jimmy] Hey, you guys, keep riding, go.

228
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:22,121
(playful upbeat music)

229
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,691
So, I just noticed, not only
are you guys riding the rides,

230
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,192
but also your cameraman.

231
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,095
So if you guys win, your
cameraman gets $3,000 as well.

232
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,196
- [All] Hey!

233
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:30,997
(hands clapping)
- Hey!

234
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,864
- [Jimmy] Tareq, bless the team.

235
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:32,699
- Thank you.

236
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,833
Guys, they gave me a blue shirt.

237
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,234
I'm part of the blue team now.

238
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,302
So, we're definitely gonna win.

239
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,570
- Hey, guys, guess what?

240
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,504
Chandler's already out.

241
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,472
- Chandler lost.

242
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,374
(tense rock music)
- Whoo.

243
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,175
- Ah.

244
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,444
- Ah, ah.

245
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,778
- Oh.

246
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:46,779
Whoa.
- Yeah.

247
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:49,615
- [Tareq] Is that a fan?

248
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:50,450
- You want some misty?

249
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,317
- Yes, please.

250
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,453
Oh, right in my face.

251
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,287
- [Tareq] Can I get one too?

252
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,288
Oh.
- Oh, sorry.

253
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,622
(sad dramatic music)

254
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,623
- Wow.

255
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:01,260
(tense rock music)

256
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,996
We are going to try and hold our breath

257
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,299
from start to finish
once we exit the tunnel.

258
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,133
Now.

259
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,572
- [Tareq] All right,
he's holding his breath.

260
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,207
You can breathe if you want to.

261
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,843
(rollercoaster rattling)

262
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,144
Oh, we lost Chris, guys.

263
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,649
(Chris breathes deeply)

264
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,484
- I made it.

265
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,686
- [Jimmy] Who here wants a pillow?

266
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,520
- Me, pillow.

267
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,755
- [Jimmy] Okay, I-
(Marcus coughing)

268
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,223
Are you dying?

269
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,190
- We just held our breath-

270
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,091
- We just held our breath the entire time.

271
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:32,925
- We held our breath the whole time.

272
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:33,760
- [Jimmy] Oh, really?
- Yeah.

273
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,594
- [Jimmy] All right,
we're gonna have a contest

274
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:35,762
for the pillow.

275
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,096
All right, Garrett, pick a
number between one and 100.

276
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:37,930
- 76.

277
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,765
- [Jimmy] No.

278
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:39,599
- 17.

279
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,433
- 12.

280
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,267
- 6.

281
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,101
- 63.

282
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:42,935
- 54.

283
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:43,770
- 32.

284
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,004
- [Jimmy] All right, screw it,
just give everyone pillows.

285
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,172
(contestants cheering)

286
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,509
(gentle relaxing music)

287
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,513
- Ride it with your eyes closed.

288
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,480
It's so much fun.
(Luke laughing)

289
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,448
Oh, my God!
- No, it's not.

290
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,282
- I can't handle it.

291
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,483
- It's way worse with your eyes closed.

292
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,552
- I decided to ride
one time with the boys.

293
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,353
- Hey, boys.

294
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,954
- Oh, and Chandler came with me.

295
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,590
Blue team's in the back
doing blue team things.

296
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,560
I think I'm just gonna start
my own team, team yellow.

297
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,761
Ah.

298
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,864
Blue team has numbers,
but white team has heart.

299
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,499
Chris is also sleeping.
(contestant screaming)

300
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,967
We'll see how it goes.

301
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,603
- [Tareq] All right, looks
like Jimmy's out guys.

302
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,438
- I am.

303
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,272
Yellow team lost.

304
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,273
I quit.
(Tareq laughing)

305
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,408
(gentle music)

306
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,342
- [Contestant] Check his pulse.

307
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,510
- Are you alive?

308
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,344
You alive?

309
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:26,179
- What's up?

310
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,013
- Oh, he's alive.

311
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:27,847
- What?

312
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,681
- You good now?

313
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,116
(Chris groans)

314
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,117
- All right.

315
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,620
I'm just gonna assume that he's asleep.

316
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,655
Yeah, he's asleep.

317
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,591
- They're not talking trash.

318
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,659
They're talking nice.

319
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,593
Hey.

320
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,662
You all have really nice smiles.

321
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:43,496
- Thank you.

322
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,165
It was a gift from my wife, yeah.

323
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:46,999
- You look good in blue.

324
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,068
- Thank you, you also look good in white.

325
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:49,902
(Luke laughing)

326
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:50,770
- [Dustin] Your Gucci slides are fly.

327
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,604
- Thank you.

328
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,972
You could deserve anybody.

329
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,640
- [Dustin] You smell like roses.

330
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,242
- I think they've gone crazy.

331
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,878
(upbeat music)

332
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,712
(Tareq laughs)

333
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:00,613
- I've been through a lot.

334
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,447
Hair tie?

335
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,017
- Oh!

336
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,219
- I'm a pirate.

337
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,287
(rollercoaster roaring)

338
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,689
- Wow, That was so loud.

339
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,591
- The speed limit's 30.

340
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,795
- We all here.
(hands clapping)

341
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:16,829
They only got three.

342
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:21,868
- [Jimmy] All right.

343
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,135
It's been another hour and 1/2.

344
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,604
I want to do more negotiating.

345
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,705
Who do you guys want to give up?

346
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,539
Dustin.

347
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,040
Who would you guys trade for Dustin?

348
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,875
Garrett?

349
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,876
Chris?

350
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:30,910
Marcus?

351
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,678
(relaxing music)

352
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,046
What would you guys trade for Jake?

353
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,882
- I think I got some pocket lint.

354
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,383
(Tareq laughing)
(Garrett laughing)

355
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,217
- [Jimmy] All right.

356
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,552
- Dustin, what are the
odds you get out right now?

357
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,021
- [Jimmy] This is your best
odds to even out the players.

358
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,423
You gotta make big boy plays
if you want the 20 grand.

359
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,892
- One out of 10.

360
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,026
- [Jimmy] One out of 10.

361
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,361
- I got to stand up for this.

362
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,062
- [Jimmy] On the count of three,
you're gonna pick a number

363
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,130
between one and 10.

364
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,131
Same with you.

365
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,267
If you guys say the
same number, you're out.

366
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,202
If you say different numbers, you stay in,

367
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,603
and we do the same for Ty.

368
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,039
If they say the same number, Ty gets out.

369
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,873
One, two, three.

370
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,542
- [Ty] Two.
- [Dustin] Two.

371
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,877
(contestants screaming)

372
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,811
- Let's go!

373
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,615
(contestants screaming)

374
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,150
(dramatic music)
- Want to do it me and you?

375
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,984
One time.

376
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:12,818
- [Jimmy] All right, first one's for Luke.

377
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,654
Remember, boys, it's one through five.

378
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,222
This time, it's for Chris.

379
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,456
One, two, three.

380
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,624
- Two.

381
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,458
You haven't said anything.

382
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,293
- I held up my hand.

383
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,160
- [Jimmy] All right,
well, it's written down.

384
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,994
- [Garrett] It's one.

385
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:22,828
- [Luke] Hold on.

386
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:23,763
- [Jimmy] This is what
he wrote down beforehand.

387
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,630
- That's fine.

388
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,165
- [Jimmy] We're gonna
keep rollercoaster going.

389
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,500
All right, Ty, you got out.

390
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,334
How do you feel?

391
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,603
- I feel pretty confident
we're still gonna win.

392
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,837
I got faith in my boys.

393
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:32,672
- [Jimmy] Can you still dance?

394
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,839
- Oh, I can definitely still dance.

395
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,941
- [Jimmy] Let me see.

396
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,543
(upbeat music)

397
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,280
- [Ty] That impressive, Connor?

398
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,148
(Jimmy laughing)

399
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,184
(bouncy upbeat music)

400
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,620
- [Jimmy] $1,000 for the
next person to step out.

401
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,454
I don't care who.

402
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,889
None of you guys want $1,000?

403
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,757
Dustin, you could have
a grand and be done.

404
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,025
- That's fine 'cause last time I checked,

405
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,460
five is more than a one.

406
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,795
- [Jimmy] Go ahead and send them off,

407
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,064
but let this thought
marinate in your head.

408
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:58,898
- All right.

409
00:09:58,898 --> 00:09:59,732
- [Jimmy] $1,000, boys.

410
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,805
Final offer, $2,000 if anyone steps out.

411
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,073
(Dustin groaning)

412
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,941
Here's the deal though,
if one of you left,

413
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,009
you would have more leg room,

414
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,611
and you actually might
be able to last longer,

415
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,778
instead of being scrunched up.

416
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,613
- I like it.

417
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,480
- [Dustin] All right, I'm doing it.

418
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,314
- [Jake] Are you going?

419
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,148
Are you doing it?

420
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:16,983
He's doing it.

421
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:17,817
Doing it.
- [Luke] He's doing it.

422
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,684
- [Jimmy] $2,000 step out right now.

423
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:19,518
You getting out?

424
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,353
- [Chandler] Welcome.
- [Jimmy] All right.

425
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,153
(hands clapping)

426
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,888
Dusty just won $2,000.

427
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:23,756
Congrats.

428
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,524
- Oh, my God, leg room.

429
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,726
- [Jimmy] So, how do you feel?

430
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,060
- Mentally, I'm drained.

431
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,128
I couldn't go any longer-

432
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,930
- [Jimmy] So, fans want to
know, do you have eyeballs?

433
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,831
- Yes.

434
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,832
- [Jimmy] Nice, gotcha.

435
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,533
And three people remain on blue.

436
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,168
You guys have lost two teammates,

437
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,403
but you've gained a lot of leg room.

438
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,704
Let's see how it does you.

439
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,407
- [Fan] Chris, you want some gum?

440
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,709
- Oh, yeah, hold up,
when we come back around.

441
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,543
This kid's gonna throw me gum.

442
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:45,645
You got to catch it.

443
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,414
I got it.

444
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,248
Yeah!

445
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,383
He threw me gum.

446
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,350
- Thanks for the gum, boys.

447
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,019
Hey, they love us.

448
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,220
Hey, let me get another piece.

449
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,054
- That gum's really good.

450
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,055
Oh, whoa.

451
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,089
Whoa.
- Yeah!

452
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,457
- He gave the boys gum.

453
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,259
- [Tareq] Hey, we got
a whole pack this time.

454
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,695
- Hey, Jimmy, some kid gave me gum.

455
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,596
- I wish I had some playing cards

456
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,665
or like a board game or something.

457
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,766
- Do you want your gum back?

458
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:07,900
- [Fan] Nah, do you
want beef jerky though?

459
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,968
- Yeah.

460
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:09,802
- Yeah.

461
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:10,670
(Chris laughing)
(hands clapping)

462
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,504
Yes.

463
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,405
We put in an order.

464
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,073
This time he's getting us jerky.

465
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,777
- [Tareq] Y'all, Chris made a
friend on this rollercoaster.

466
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:18,878
- [Man] Holy.

467
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,046
He got a jerky.

468
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:20,880
- [Garrett] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

469
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,714
- [Chris] No, no, no.

470
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,515
- [Fan] Hey, will you sign this?

471
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,349
(fans yelling)

472
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,350
- [Fan] Bye!

473
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,452
- We started a problem.

474
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,888
Now, every kid wants to throw us stuff.

475
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,089
- [Tareq] That's not a good idea.

476
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,191
Especially being on a rollercoaster.

477
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,025
- No.

478
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,695
What if we came back
with a Xbox this time.

479
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,529
(Tareq laughing)

480
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,630
Just, we got an Xbox now.

481
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,904
(upbeat music)

482
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,673
- [Jimmy] So, I heard
you guys have a deal.

483
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,009
- We want to trade Marcus for Jake.

484
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:50,843
Marcus gets out, Jake gets out.

485
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,411
- [Jimmy] I'll let him
know your negotiation.

486
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,680
They offered Marcus for Jake.

487
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,981
- No.

488
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:56,849
- [Jimmy] Jake said no.

489
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,117
He said, screw your offer.

490
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:58,951
Keep going.

491
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,254
- I look like Gangster
Mike from "The Office."

492
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,824
Oh, Scranton, where you at?

493
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,125
- [Tareq] Garrett, you
are Dwight happening.

494
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:06,959
- [Garrett] I'm not Dwight.

495
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,294
- You are Dwight.

496
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,529
(upbeat music)

497
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,199
Whoa, Chris, what are you doing?

498
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,200
- I'm getting out.

499
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,034
- Chris, no.

500
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:15,868
- [Contestant] Not this time.

501
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,702
- I'm getting out.

502
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:17,536
- [Contestant] Not this time.

503
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:18,370
- [Tareq] Chris, what's going on?

504
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,072
- I entrust everything
in Marcus and Garrett.

505
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:20,906
They can do it.

506
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,842
- [Jimmy] If you get out, your
boys might not carry through

507
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:23,809
with the 20 grand.

508
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,312
- [Chris] Boom.

509
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,680
- [Jimmy] He's out.

510
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,048
It is now a two V two.

511
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:29,882
- Game over.

512
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:30,716
- [Jimmy] Game over?

513
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:31,550
- [Garrett] We will win this for you.

514
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,685
- I get really motion sick,

515
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,820
and that roller coaster
was just tearing me down,

516
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,654
tearing me down.

517
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,423
I knew I had two solid teammates.

518
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,558
I'm gonna just get out,
and you guys got it,

519
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:40,993
and I believe in them they can do it.

520
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:41,827
Blue team.

521
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,796
- And then there were four.

522
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,630
- [Employee] All clear.

523
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,866
- All clear.

524
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,901
- [Tareq] How does it
feel to have more space?

525
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,970
- It feels like I got a lot of space.

526
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,805
- [Tareq] Aye.

527
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,541
(hands clapping)

528
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,979
- Mom, if you want to know
why I haven't messaged you

529
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,348
at all today, I've been here.

530
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,950
- Whee.

531
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,386
- [Tareq] Oh, put your legs in the cart.

532
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:11,157
- We have lost Garrett to the
madness of the rollercoaster.

533
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,527
(upbeat music)

534
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,361
- [Jimmy] Let's Rock Paper Scissors.

535
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,195
- We're talking it out.

536
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,164
We're just talking out
the thought process.

537
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:18,998
- [Jimmy] All or nothing,
Rock Paper Scissors.

538
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:19,832
- Yes.
- All or nothing.

539
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:20,666
- Okay.

540
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,500
- [Jimmy] White team
wants to settle it all

541
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,868
for nothing, Rock Paper Scissors.

542
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,003
- Ah, let's get it, come on.

543
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,204
- All right, let's just game it.

544
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,038
- [Tareq] Why is it-

545
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,973
- 20,000 on the line between you guys.

546
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,008
The reason we're doing
this is 'cause the park

547
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,609
actually closes in under an hour,

548
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,677
and they're gonna go all day.

549
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,513
So, we literally have no
other way to settle this.

550
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,347
Do it.

551
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,515
Rock Paper Scissors.

552
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,084
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

553
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,553
- [Jimmy] Turn around.

554
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,353
- [Jake] Let's go.

555
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,855
- [Luke] Hey!

556
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,390
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

557
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,959
- Hey, let's go.

558
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,160
- [Jimmy] It is now tied.

559
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,361
It's tied.

560
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,930
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

561
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:52,832
- [Jake] Let's get it.
- [Luke] Yes!

562
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,666
- [Jimmy] Oh.

563
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,600
All right.

564
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,935
White is up two to one.

565
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,037
If you lose this next one,
that's 20 grand, boys.

566
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,038
- Chris, don't screw up there, bro.

567
00:13:59,038 --> 00:13:59,939
- Chris is good, we got this, we got this.

568
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,141
- [Jimmy] You guys are currently
up 20 grand on the line.

569
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,375
- There's more adrenaline
right now than the entire day.

570
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,610
- Chandler, look they're cheering.

571
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,046
(fans cheering)

572
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,114
- [Jimmy] Chandler never wins.

573
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,649
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

574
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,819
(contestants screaming)
(bouncy upbeat music)

575
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:14,753
- Let's go!

576
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,123
Get over here.

577
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,826
(contestants cheering)
Let's go!

578
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,795
- [Jimmy] Well, I'm sorry, boys.

579
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,530
(sad dramatic music)

580
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,731
Okay, hey, here you go.

581
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,099
Split it up, Chandler.

582
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,500
Don't forget about Dustin.

583
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,335
- Hey, (indistinct) come here.

584
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,169
- [Dustin] Thank you.

585
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,238
- [Jimmy] The bottom of
it is 100s, share it.

586
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,239

587
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,240

- [Jimmy] Right.

589
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,108
They're cheering on you.

590
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:36,942
- [Fans] Chandler, Chandler!

591
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,278
- [Chandler] What do you guys want?

592
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,112
- [Jimmy] So, what are you guys gonna do

593
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,080
with all the money you won?

594
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,914
- We're gonna go bowling.

595
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:42,815

- [Jimmy] Hey, wait, wait.

599
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,552
Can you guys at least pay
for the other team's bowling?

600
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,386
- Yeah, yeah, we'll do that.

601
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,220
- Yeah.
- Yeah, all right.

602
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,288

603
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,122
- Okay.

604
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:50,956

608
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,827
- In a row.

609
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:55,661

610
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,795

00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:57,630
(hands clapping)
- [Jimmy] Whoa.

612
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,430
Is this the new Chandler?
