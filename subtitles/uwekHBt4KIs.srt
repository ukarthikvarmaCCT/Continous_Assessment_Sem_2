1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,113
Hello, friends!

2
00:00:01,113 --> 00:00:03,230
On 11th April 1970,

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:08,241
a rocket launched for the Apollo 13 mission 
from Kennedy Space Center in America.

4
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:16,713
Three astronauts were on it,

5
00:00:16,713 --> 00:00:18,004
going to the moon.

6
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:19,672
But the interesting thing was that

7
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:21,904
not even a year had passed since the day

8
00:00:21,904 --> 00:00:25,192
when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon for the first time.

9
00:00:27,697 --> 00:00:30,368
This was already the third NASA mission

10
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:32,177
to send humans to the moon.

11
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:34,216
Seeing the success of the last two missions,

12
00:00:34,216 --> 00:00:38,018
the astronauts in this rocket were very confident about their mission

13
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:39,552
and their dream.

14
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:42,184
Their dream was to set foot on the moon.

15
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:44,757
But at that time, they were unaware that

16
00:00:44,757 --> 00:00:47,796
their dream would never come true.

17
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:49,901
In April 1970,

18
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:54,129
when their spacecraft was about 330,000 km away from the Earth,

19
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:57,134
they heard a loud bang, suddenly.

20
00:00:57,134 --> 00:01:00,821
A huge bang that shook the entire spacecraft.

21
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:04,118
Within a few seconds, the warning lights and alarms start going on.

22
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:05,217
Loudly.

23
00:01:05,217 --> 00:01:08,898
It was found that one of the oxygen tanks had burst.

24
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:13,820
And the other oxygen tank was leaking rapidly.

25
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,216
"Okay Houston, we've had a problem here."

26
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:17,882
"This is Houston, say again, please."

27
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:20,458
"Houston, we have a problem."

28
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:23,314
The mission control on the ground couldn't believe it.

29
00:01:23,314 --> 00:01:25,492
They believed that the instruments were malfunctioning.

30
00:01:25,492 --> 00:01:30,537
But the astronauts in the spacecraft could see through the window

31
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:32,327
that the air was leaking.

32
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:34,651
On the other hand, they see that because of the blast,

33
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:37,362
the spacecraft had shifted from its path so much that

34
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:40,911
it was going kilometres away from the Earth every second.

35
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:44,043
Within a few hours, the astronauts in Apollo 13

36
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:46,478
were so far away from the Earth that

37
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:48,508
it became a new record.

38
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:52,217
To date, no human has gone so far from the Earth

39
00:01:52,217 --> 00:01:54,486
as these three astronauts did

40
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:56,246
during the Apollo 13 mission.

41
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:57,898
Forget landing on the moon,

42
00:01:57,898 --> 00:01:59,906
the question back then was

43
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:02,706
whether they could return to Earth alive.

44
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:07,086
This is the distressing story of Apollo 13.

45
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,211
"Carbon dioxide levels in the module are rising. 

46
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:12,805
 

47
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:14,882
 

48
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:16,661
"The crew were beginning to suffer.

49
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:18,477
It was a dire state.

50
00:02:18,477 --> 00:02:20,836
It was a really, really emergency situation."

51
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,701
In 1961, American President John F. Kennedy

52
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:28,773
promised the world that

53
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,572
before the end of the decade,

54
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:32,944
he would have humans on the moon.

55
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,519
"...achieving the goal,

56
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,007
before this decade is out,

57
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:37,646
of landing a man on the moon,

58
00:02:37,646 --> 00:02:39,500
and returning him safely to the Earth."

59
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,456
This promise should be seen in the context of the Cold War.

60
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:46,413
At that time, America and the Soviet Union were engaged in a race.

61
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:47,693
A space race.

62
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:50,329
Who will be the leader in the field of technology?

63
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:52,187
In 1969,

64
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:55,546
both Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions were successful.

65
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:58,140
Astronauts did not only step on the moon

66
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,283
but also safely returned to Earth.

67
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:04,301
Kennedy's promise was fulfilled.

68
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,387
But it had a side effect:

69
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:11,227
right after it, the people's and government's interest

70
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:13,569
in spending money on space

71
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,331
decreased drastically.

72
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:17,812
It's obvious that people were excited

73
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:20,132
to see a man step on the moon for the first time.

74
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:25,860
But people cannot be so excited for the second, third, and fourth time.

75
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,596
"The interest in the moon is fading fast.

76
00:03:28,596 --> 00:03:30,342
People believed that Apollo 13

77
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:32,694
would just be another routine flight."

78
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:36,534
For this reason, the American government cut NASA's budget.

79
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:39,605
And many future missions that were planned for the new few years,

80
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:42,227
like Apollo 20, were cancelled.

81
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:44,423
That's why the Apollo 13 mission

82
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:47,095
came at a crucial time in the history of space travel.

83
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:49,973
NASA had to prove to the American government that

84
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:53,028
it was still worth spending money on space.

85
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:55,499
That's why the primary mission objective of Apollo 13 was

86
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:58,126
not only to inspect and survey the moon's soil

87
00:03:58,126 --> 00:04:01,043
but to also develop the human capability

88
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:03,449
to work in the moon's environment.

89
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:06,055
"The main mission objective of Apollo 13

90
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:08,437
is scientific exploration of the moon.

91
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:11,341
We hope to find out a lot about the origin of the moon

92
00:04:11,341 --> 00:04:13,869
and from that the origin of our own planet Earth."

93
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:16,444
The design of Apollo 13's spacecraft

94
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:18,777
was similar to that of the previous space missions.

95
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:20,598
Mainly, there were four main components

96
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:22,610
Command module, service module,

97
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,507
lunar module, and launch escape system.

98
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:29,075
The spacecraft was launched on a Saturn V rocket.

99
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:31,216
All three astronauts were seated in the command module,

100
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:33,120
which was the main part of the spacecraft.

101
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,969
But it was a small part.

102
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:37,306
The command module is just this cone shape

103
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:38,641
which is only 11 feet long

104
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:40,469
and has a diameter of 13 feet.

105
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:42,987
All the instrument panels, navigation gear,

106
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,704
radios, life support system,

107
00:04:44,704 --> 00:04:47,227
and small engines were all in this command module.

108
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:49,796
The second most important part was the service module,

109
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:51,914
which had most of the oxygen for the astronauts.

110
00:04:51,914 --> 00:04:53,733
It had some more engines too

111
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:56,372
and fuel cells to generate electricity.

112
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:59,313
The command and service module is often

113
00:04:59,313 --> 00:05:01,163
collectively called the command and service module

114
00:05:01,163 --> 00:05:03,298
or CSM in short form.

115
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:05,499
They are connected during the entire mission

116
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:08,425
until the astronauts return to Earth.

117
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:10,881
And only during the re-entry to Earth

118
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:12,569
are they separated from each other.

119
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:14,747
The third part was the lunar module,

120
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,074
which was actually supposed to land on the moon.

121
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:18,824
And once the work on moon was over,

122
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:21,481
it was supposed to get attached to the CSM module once again.

123
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:23,257
The fourth part, the Launch Escape System,

124
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:24,875
was not so important for the mission.

125
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:29,103
Its only task was to protect the astronauts from an accident during the launch.

126
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:30,584
It works like this.

127
00:05:30,584 --> 00:05:33,124
If there's an accident during the rocket launch,

128
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,447
and the rocket catches fire,

129
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:36,864
it safely ejects the astronauts

130
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:38,055
and takes them away from the accident.

131
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:39,581
You can see in this video,

132
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:41,829
where this abort system was being tested.

133
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:43,867
But if everything goes well in the launch,

134
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:45,796
then the LES is not needed

135
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:47,885
and it is ejected and thrown away.

136
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,483
On 11th April 1970,

137
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:53,375
since Apollo 13 launched safely and successfully

138
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,933
the LES was not needed.

139
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,121
3 astronauts were on the spacecraft.

140
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:59,458
Commander Jim Lovell,

141
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:02,340
the pilot of the Lunar Module, Fred Haise,

142
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,687
and the third, pilot of the Command Module, Jack Swigert.

143
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:08,336
Coincidentally, according to the original plan,

144
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:11,520
none of these three were chosen for this mission.

145
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,991
Originally, three different astronauts were chosen for this mission.

146
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:18,218
But they all had different problems because of which

147
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:20,221
they were not able to participate in this mission.

148
00:06:20,221 --> 00:06:24,472
For this reason, the crew of these three astronauts takes off from the Earth.

149
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:26,540
To see this rocket launch

150
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,832
there were around 200,000 spectators on the ground.

151
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:30,548
This was a small number

152
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:34,379
compared to the Apollo 11 lift-off the previous year.

153
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:37,751
That had 7 million spectators for the rocket launch.

154
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:39,998
NASA again realized

155
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:44,017
how quickly people lost their interest in space exploration.

156
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:45,713
But if we talk about the mission,

157
00:06:45,713 --> 00:06:49,425
this spacecraft took off smoothly towards its destination.

158
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:53,156
It was supposed to take 3 days for them 
to reach the Fra Mauro crater of the moon.

159
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:55,434
This is a big hole on the moon's surface.

160
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:56,699
A crater.

161
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,360
Which is believed to contain a lot of information

162
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,864
not only about the moon but also about the Earth.

163
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:04,822
The biggest problem during the first 2 days of the flight was when

164
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:06,820
astronaut Jack Swigert realized that

165
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,001
he had forgotten to file his income tax return.

166
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:12,723
He asked the mission control on Earth

167
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,217
whether he could get an extension.

168
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:32,431
He got a good-humoured reply that

169
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,290
that he could get a 60-day extension.

170
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,234
This conversation proves that

171
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:38,724
everything was going right.

172
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,791
During the first two days, there were no problems in the mission.

173
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,657
At 46 hours 43 minutes of the mission,

174
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:48,180
the capsule communicator on duty at that time said that

175
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,281
the spacecraft was in a good shape

176
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:52,277
and that they were bored sitting there.

177
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:55,559
"This is Apollo Control at 46 hours, 43 minutes."

178
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,883
"Spacecraft is in real good shape as far as we're concerned, Jim.

179
00:07:57,883 --> 00:07:59,185
We're bored to tears down here."

180
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:01,046
Things were going so smoothly that

181
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:02,560
people were getting bored.

182
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,406
By the way, you will feel very strange to hear this,

183
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:07,452
but intentionally giving yourself time to get bored

184
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:09,508
is a good habit, in my opinion.

185
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:13,884
I believe that if you want to maximize your productivity and creativity,

186
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:16,363
then you have to leave sometime free during the day.

187
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,146
A timewhen you are literally doing nothing,

188
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:20,322
just getting bored.

189
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:22,486
This is very important to relax the mind,

190
00:08:22,486 --> 00:08:23,797
especially in today's world.

191
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:25,786
If a person gets bored for 5 seconds,

192
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:28,753
he starts scrolling through his phone.

193
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:30,431
This is the big secret

194
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:32,505
as to how I can manage my time so efficiently

195
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:35,417
and consistently manage to give you so many videos.

196
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,900
And that too while continuously travelling.

197
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,741
I have shared many more such secrets and practical tips

198
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:42,812
in my time management course.

212
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,038
then go and try it.

213
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:18,307
Now let's get back to the topic.

214
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,339
The third day of the mission,

215
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:20,524
13th April,

216
00:09:20,524 --> 00:09:21,990
the crew is told that

217
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,110
they have to do some tests on the lunar module.

218
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,563
And apart from this,

219
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:27,130
they have to do a broadcast for the television.

220
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,714
Where they will use the cameras

221
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:32,549
to show the interiors of the command module and service module to the world.

222
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:34,994
Now the audience's interest in this was so low that

223
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:38,438
no television network showed this broadcast at that time.

224
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:39,747
Commander Lovell's wife

225
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:43,310
went to the VIP section of the mission control to watch this broadcast.

226
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,920
About 6 and a half minutes after the end of the TV broadcast,

227
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,838
the flight controllers on the ground

228
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,868
asked astronaut Swigert

229
00:09:50,868 --> 00:09:52,939
to check the oxygen level.

230
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:54,456
There was nothing unusual in this.

231
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:58,695
It was just a routine check of the oxygen tanks in the service module.

232
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:00,259
And while this check was being done,

233
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:03,156
suddenly, a huge explosion occurred.

234
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:05,800
Many warning lights and alarms went off.

235
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,791
As I told you at the beginning of the video,

236
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,599
the astronauts in the spacecraft were largely in shock.

237
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:14,021
Commander Lovell contacted Mission Control and said,

238
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:16,117
"Houston, we've have had a problem."

239
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:19,615
It turned out that one tank of oxygen was completely empty

240
00:10:19,615 --> 00:10:22,779
and the oxygen level in the other tank was going down rapidly.

241
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:25,462
Mission Control on the ground first thought that

242
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:27,010
the instruments must be showing the wrong data,

243
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,858
but that was the truth.

244
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:31,652
Everyone needed to take action urgently

245
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:34,304
if they wanted to save the lives of these astronauts.

246
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:36,627
The TV channels that had called this mission boring

247
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:37,923
and were not showing it on the news

248
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:40,713
made this the news headlines suddenly.

249
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:42,745
"Apollo 13 to the moon

250
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:44,731
is in serious jeopardy this morning.

251
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:47,128
And it is not going to make a moon landing."

252
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:49,265
The oxygen tanks in the spacecraft

253
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:50,811
were sphere-shaped.

254
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:53,563
In these, oxygen was stored in liquid form.

255
00:10:53,563 --> 00:10:55,983
There was a heater at the center

256
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:58,826
which converted the liquid oxygen into gas.

257
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:02,985
On Apollo 13, there were two such tanks in the service module.

258
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:04,458
The tank number 2

259
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,764
was originally installed in Apollo 10

260
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:09,660
but was removed from there for modification.

261
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,405
And a minor accident happened with it.

262
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,827
It accidentally fell down during repair

263
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:16,027
and was damaged.

264
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:19,038
The tube inside it was damaged

265
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:21,788
but no one saw it during the inspection.

266
00:11:21,788 --> 00:11:23,151
While testing it,

267
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:24,780
people noticed that the tank

268
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,589
would not be completely empty.

269
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:29,250
To get rid of the remaining oxygen,

270
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,055
heaters were used to boil it completely.

271
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:36,475
Later, it was found that the thermometer inside it

272
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:39,614
could show a maximum temperature of 30°C.

273
00:11:39,614 --> 00:11:43,797
But when the heater was used to heat the oxygen in the tank,

274
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:48,311
the temperature would reach as high as 538°C.

275
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:50,895
No one noticed this extreme heating

276
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:52,279
because it did not register in the thermometer.

277
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,075
Due to this extreme heating,

278
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:58,799
the insulation of the electrical wires in the tank were damaged.

279
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,114
Before the mission, NASA's managers and engineers

280
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:04,890
had approved the tank after a thorough investigation

281
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,517
but they were unable to see the internal damage.

282
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:08,885
And because of this,

283
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:10,639
during the Apollo 13 mission

284
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,154
during the routine check of the tank on the third day

285
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:16,502
due to those electric wires,

286
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,111
there was a spark and the tank explodes.

287
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:23,106
It was only by chance that the tank was attached to the exterior of the spacecraft.

288
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:26,394
Had it been attached inside the spacecraft and exploded there

289
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:28,797
then all the astronauts would have been k!lled instantly.

290
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:30,535
But because it was on the outside,

291
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:32,130
the explosion occurred outside.

292
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,008
And only a 13-foot panel was damaged in the service module.

293
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:38,763
What else was damaged in the spacecraft?

294
00:12:38,763 --> 00:12:40,944
The astronauts were not so sure.

295
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:43,622
Now everyone had to make an important decision.

296
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:46,392
Which way could they take to return to Earth?

297
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:48,509
The fastest way to return to Earth was to

298
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:50,764
rotate the spacecraft.

299
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:52,460
But to do this,

300
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,740
the main engine of the service module had to be started.

301
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:00,156
The main engine was located near the blast in the CSM module.

302
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:03,688
No one knew whether the engine was damaged or not.

303
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:06,567
The second way to return to Earth was to

304
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:08,539
go towards the moon

305
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,622
and circle around the moon

306
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:12,695
to return to the Earth.

307
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:15,287
For this, the engine of the service module would not be required.

308
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:17,006
But the risk was that

309
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:20,178
it would take 4-5 days to return to Earth.

310
00:13:20,178 --> 00:13:23,881
Did the astronauts have enough oxygen and water left?

311
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:26,582
NASA's flight director chose the second option.

312
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:28,430
To take the long way back.

313
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,771
The astronauts were told to shut down the CSM module immediately.

314
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:39,128
And while returning,

315
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:42,549
they were told to use the lunar module as a lifeboat.

316
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:46,218
Though this decision was a safe option, it did have several problems.

317
00:13:46,218 --> 00:13:48,748
The lunar module was designed in such a way that

318
00:13:48,748 --> 00:13:51,219
only two astronauts could sit in it

319
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:52,463
for about 20 hours.

320
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:53,994
Because as I told you,

321
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:56,419
its original purpose was to land on the moon

322
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,843
and get attached to the CSM module again.

323
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:01,018
But now, it was expected that

324
00:14:01,018 --> 00:14:04,435
these three people would sit in the lunar module

325
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:06,054
for 4-5 days.

326
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,097
The engines of the lunar module were not designed in a way that

327
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,173
they could be fired repeatedly.

328
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:14,491
To a large extent, this was also a risky manoeuvre.

329
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:17,168
To conserve supplies and energy,

330
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:23,112
the astronauts were told to shut down all non-essential systems in the spacecraft,

331
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,925
including the heaters that were installed.

332
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:28,143
It was very important to save electricity.

333
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:31,151
As per this plan, the astronauts sat in the Lunar Module

334
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:34,224
and for the first time, the engines of the Lunar Module were fired.

335
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:37,847
When an engine is started, it is called a Burn.

336
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:39,669
So, they do the first Burn

337
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:41,793
to get on the new path.

338
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:43,226
With the help of this burn,

339
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:45,721
they reached the other side of the moon.

340
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:47,079
The far side of the moon.

341
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:48,995
They became the first humans in the world

342
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:50,576
to go so far from the Earth.

343
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:53,296
And this record remains unbeatable even now.

344
00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:57,374
At their furthest point, they were 400,000 km away from the Earth.

345
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:59,363
If they stayed on this path,

346
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:03,797
they could reach the Earth about 153 hours after launch.

347
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:05,699
But this time margin was very risky.

348
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:08,024
If they reached Earth after so long,

349
00:15:08,024 --> 00:15:14,364
then only 1 hour of surplus food, water and oxygen would remain for the astronauts.

350
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:18,350
NASA team on the ground believed that this margin is very narrow.

351
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,154
That's why the astronauts were told to

352
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:23,229
burn the lunar module engine for the second time.

353
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:30,237
The engineers in the mission control had done many calculations

354
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:33,246
to find out whether the lunar module engine

355
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:35,185
will be able to handle the second burn or not.

356
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,358
These calculations proved correct

357
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:39,609
when the second burn is done,

358
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:41,736
the flight time of 153 hours

359
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:44,118
was reduced to 143 hours.

360
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:46,647
An 11-hour long margin of survival.

361
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,285
Before the astronauts could relax,

362
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:51,329
another problem arose.

363
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:53,913
The high concentration of carbon dioxide.

364
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:56,655
In spaceships, apart from oxygen tanks,

365
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,745
there are canisters of lithium hydroxide to remove carbon dioxide.

366
00:16:00,745 --> 00:16:03,337
When astronauts breathe in oxygen,

367
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,433
they breathe out carbon dioxide.

368
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:07,595
If that carbon dioxide is not removed,

369
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:11,370
it will result in a large amount of carbon dioxide which can be problematic.

370
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,487
That is why canisters of lithium hydroxide are used

371
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:16,563
so that carbon dioxide reacts with it

372
00:16:16,563 --> 00:16:18,398
and becomes lithium carbonate.

373
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:19,755
But the problem here was that

374
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:23,229
the canisters of lithium hydroxide in the lunar module

375
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:26,968
were enough for only two people to survive for 2 days.

376
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:28,927
But here, there were 3 people

377
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:32,145
who wanted to survive for 4 days.

378
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:33,729
The good thing here was that

379
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:35,896
there were some canisters in the command module too.

380
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:38,208
But their filter was square

381
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,599
and the ones in lunar module had a circular shape.

382
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:45,121
The experts on the ground had 24 hours to solve this problem.

383
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:48,105
Astronauts from the spacecraft communicated to tell them

384
00:16:48,105 --> 00:16:50,556
about all things present around them.

385
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:54,831
Plastic bags, cardboard, some suit hoses, some duct tape,

386
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:58,412
They wanted to create something that could be the solution to this problem.

387
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:01,913
After a few hours of experimenting,

388
00:17:01,913 --> 00:17:04,855
they make a contraption to make this work.

389
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:06,925
After giving step-by-step instructions,

390
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,993
a new device was created with the things present there,

391
00:17:09,993 --> 00:17:13,153
with which the level of carbon dioxide decreases again.

392
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:16,306
Commander Lovell in his book Lost Moon states that

393
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:19,518
"the contraption wasn't very handsome, but it worked."

394
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:22,329
The thing they made looked like this.

395
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,768
In this entire rescue mission, even the smallest details were taken care of.

396
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:27,977
Astronauts were instructed

397
00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:32,393
not to drink more than 200 ml of water in a day.

398
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:34,021
Because if they drink more water,

399
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:35,982
they will need to ur!nate.

400
00:17:35,982 --> 00:17:38,318
And in this way, the quantity of their ur!ne

401
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:40,040
could change the direction of the spaceship.

402
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,040
That's why they needed to survive by drinking so little water.

403
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,742
These 3 astronauts lost 14 kgs of weight in total.

404
00:17:46,742 --> 00:17:50,211
Astronaut Haise gets a urinary tract infection.

405
00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:54,843
After 4 days, when Apollo 13's spacecraft reaches Earth,

406
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:58,180
astronauts realize that they need to burn once more.

407
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,560
In their calculations,

408
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,751
they hadn't taken into account the cooling vapour present in the spacecraft.

409
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:06,107
This caused the spacecraft to wander off the track.

410
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:09,669
Commander Lovell carried out another burn of the lunar module

411
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:12,228
which brings the spacecraft back on track.

412
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:15,957
Thankfully, the spacecraft could withstand the third burn too.

413
00:18:15,957 --> 00:18:19,932
Even though this lunar module was designed to withstand only one burn.

414
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,024
The whole world was holding their breaths and watching the news channels.

415
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:26,288
And were waiting for the astronauts to return to Earth.

416
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:29,070
The family members and friends of the astronauts

417
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,889
were watching this play out on TV together.

418
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:34,270
Now the biggest question was

419
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,176
when this broken spacecraft enters the Earth's atmosphere

420
00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:43,451
will the spacecraft be about to sustain the heat impact?

421
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:46,127
Will the astronauts be able to survive?

422
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:50,562
For this part, the astronauts had to return to the command module

423
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:55,255
because only the command module was made for re-entry on the Earth.

424
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:58,490
As soon as the command module entered the Earth's atmosphere

425
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,144
there was a communication blackout.

426
00:19:01,144 --> 00:19:02,705
This was normal because

427
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:04,669
due to ionization of the air,

428
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:06,666
the radio waves get blocked

429
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,602
and communication cannot be done

430
00:19:08,602 --> 00:19:10,914
between the NASA employees present on the ground

431
00:19:10,914 --> 00:19:13,220
and the astronauts in the spacecraft.

432
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,352
Usually, this communication blackout is for 2 to 3 minutes.

433
00:19:17,352 --> 00:19:20,084
It was expected that the communication blackout here

434
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:21,980
would be for a maximum of 3 minutes.

435
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,406
3 minutes were over,

436
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:26,294
but there was no answer from the other side.

437
00:19:26,294 --> 00:19:27,756
10 seconds pass.

438
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:28,925
30 seconds.

439
00:19:28,925 --> 00:19:30,471
60 seconds.

440
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:31,839
Even after 4 minutes,

441
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,733
there was no communication from the spacecraft.

442
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:37,060
Could the astronauts survive or not?

443
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,287
4 minutes and 27 seconds later,

444
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:42,077
finally, communication was received from the other side.

445
00:19:45,614 --> 00:19:48,727
The people watching it on television could finally breathe again.

446
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:51,351
All three astronauts survived.

447
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:53,610
The parachute was deployed in the command module

448
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,630
and it slowly fell into the Pacific Ocean.

449
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,919
"Teamwork was necessary. 

450
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,825
Good leadership. 

451
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:02,653
Initiative to think outside of the box.

452
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:03,734
When things go wrong,

453
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:05,094
how do we repair them?

454
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:06,512
Those are the three things

455
00:20:06,512 --> 00:20:08,230
that were absolutely necessary."

456
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,338
The three astronauts return home safe and sound.

457
00:20:11,338 --> 00:20:12,954
Although this mission failed,

458
00:20:12,954 --> 00:20:16,227
none of the three astronauts set foot on the moon.

459
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:18,967
 But still, this Apollo 13 mission

460
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,286
made its mark on the pages of history.

461
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:24,745
Showing this historical rescue mission of the Apollo 13

462
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:27,982
and the bravery of the astronauts.

463
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:30,287
Several books are written on it

464
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:31,367
and films are made.

465
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:33,327
After the investigation of this incident,

466
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:36,164
many safety measures are adopted by NASA.

467
00:20:36,164 --> 00:20:41,701
So that there could be no such accidents in future missions.

468
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:42,864
After Apollo 13,

469
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:44,497
Apollo 14, Apollo 15,

470
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:46,750
Apollo 16, and Apollo 17

471
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,854
all these missions were successful.

472
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:50,951
On 7th December 1972,

473
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:53,389
Apollo 17 was the last mission

474
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:55,026
by NASA under the Apollo program.

475
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:58,230
The astronauts in this mission spent 3 days on the surface of the moon.

476
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,812
And this was the last time till today

477
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:03,196
when humans went to the moon.

478
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,534
What is the reason behind this?

479
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:07,580
You will get the answer to this question in my Apollo 11 video.

480
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,707
In that video, I discussed Neil Armstrong's mission.

481
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,480
You can click here to watch it.

482
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,596
Thank you very much!
