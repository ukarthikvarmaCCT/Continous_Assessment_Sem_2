1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
Our gynae was an interesting person

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,640
The first time we met her,

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,120
She asked us “how long have you been trying for?”

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,280
“Why does it concern you?”

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,480
We got the desired end result.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,960
So, focus on it.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,000
It’s not like if we say it happened in first attempt

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,080
You would start celebrating,

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,200
“Well done Mr Ranyal,

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,360
you have exceeded all expectations.”

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,840
Which means we got pregnant 5 years ago.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,600
That’s how maths works.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,480
And these days you have to say ‘We are pregnant’

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,680
‘We are pregnant’

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,840
Technically only she was pregnant

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,320
I just have fat

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,560
But still I have to say ‘We are pregnant’

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,360
But if I make a mistake

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,800
Then only I am an idiot,

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,520
Its never like ‘we are the idiots’ and we are pleased to meet you.

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,600
That doesn’t happen

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,920
We went to a gynae post finding out about our pregnancy

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,040
Gynae did some test and told us ‘Good news, you guys are pregnant,

24
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,560
But don’t tell anyone right away.

25
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,680
We will do some more tests in 2 weeks

26
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,680
Post that you can tell people.”

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,200
We said okay, Fair enough.

28
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,120
She continued “one more thing,

29
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,280
Now you guys can’t have sex.”

30
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,240
I assumed she meant it only for the 2 weeks.

31
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,400
we are not that desperate

32
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,360
We already did a lot to get pregnant.

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,680
Gynae corrected us “No no no,

34
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,000
You can’t do it for the whole 9 months

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,400
And 2 months post that.”

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,240
Now it doesn’t sound like a good news

37
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,720
It feels like an above average news.

38
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,920
And I couldn’t believe that you cant have sex during pregnancy,

39
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,640
Because our primary source of sex education – English sitcoms.

40
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,560
In that people are doing it during pregnancy.

41
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,160
So I googled “Can you have sex…

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,960
Google gives options 

43
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,680
The first option was

44
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,720
“Can you have sex in space?”

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,040
Who are these kids who want to be astronauts

46
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,120
But want to see if they will get action in space or not.

47
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,480
Second option, I’m not kidding

48
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,120
“Can you have sex post heart attack?”

49
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,760
Both the young and old have too many needs in our nation.

50
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,840
5th option was “Can you have sex during pregnancy?”

51
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,840
I read up all the research articles,

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,120
All of them advised against doing it in the first trimester

53
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,480
But recommended it in the second trimester,

54
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,560
Some of them even said you can lift each other while doing it,

55
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,200
Provided there is no physical injury,

56
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,040
If you can manage it.

57
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,480
So I went back to the doctor,

58
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,040
How dare you stop us?

59
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,160
Science says we can.

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,920
Doctor replied “Fine, do it then,

61
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,880
But if any complications arises, then don’t come back

62
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,080
You are a doctor,

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,720
Your entire profession relies on complication.

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,360
What kind of doctor wants only healthy patients?

65
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,480
And I know whenever I discuss this topic – sex during pregnancy,

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,000
It divides the room.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
Because some people must be thinking “Why so desperate,

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,960
You don’t have any control?”

69
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,520
It’s not about control,

70
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,080
I should have the right to decide.

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,000
And this is all I have done in the last 4 years,

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,040
Whenever I meet a gynae, I ask them

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,600
“Do you allow sex during 2nd trimester or not?”

74
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,400
And I have noticed a trend,

75
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,320
That young doctor, who are less than 40,

76
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,640
They are allowing it.

77
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,480
Because they have read the latest textbooks.

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,120
Gynae who are 50+ do not allow it

79
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,720
They are dreaming of becoming a grandparent soon.

80
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,720
One of the gynae shouted at me “You shouldn’t even think about it,

81
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,080
Such impure thoughts shouldn’t enter your head.”

82
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Impure thoughts?

83
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,360
You are a gynae,

84
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,960
Your practice relies on these impure thoughts.

85
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
if I were a gynae

86
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,240
I would encourage my patients to have more sex,

87
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,640
You get new diseases, I will cure you.

88
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,920
How else will I make money?

89
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Our gynae was an interesting person

90
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
The first time we met her,

91
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,160
She asked us “how long have you been trying for?”

92
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,200
“Why does it concern you?”

93
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,400
We got the desired end result.

94
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,880
So focus on it.

95
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,040
It’s not like if we say it happened in first attempt

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,120
You would start celebrating

97
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
“Well done Mr Ranyal,

98
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,800
You have exceeded all expectations.”

99
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,840
Your horoscopes as well as your organs are compatible.

100
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,120
We got all the tests done in 2 weeks.

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,000
Everything was fine.

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,360
We told our parents, they got over excited with the news

103
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,520
This is the first time where I have enjoyed a process whose outcome my parents have enjoyed.

104
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,560
My dad started respecting me,

105
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,480
He called me and said “Beta Ji”

106
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,360
I got shocked by the ‘Ji’

107
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,680
so I said “Uncle, wrong connection.”

108
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,800
“it’s your dad, you idiot.”

109
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,000
“Yes , Papa Ji”

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,800
But we didn’t tell anyone except our parents

111
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Because of this concept called ‘ Evil Eyes’

112
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,680
What great concept we guys have.

113
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,120
According to ‘Evil Eye’, if you are doing well in life,

114
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,840
Don’t show it, instead hide it.

115
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,120
Because someone will lay their evil eye on it and steal it from you.

116
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,600
Basically, it means, you can buy a Mercedes,

117
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,160
But don’t but it.

118
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,640
Instead buy an activa,

119
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,760
And overtake the same Mercedes from the left side.

120
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,720
Post the first trimester, we told our friends.

121
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,840
Amongst my friends, I was the first one to become a parent.

122
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,880
My guy friends didn’t know how to react,

123
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,080
Single guys don’t know how to act in front of a pregnant lady.

124
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,000
They have seen pregnant women asking for pickle on daily soap.

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
5 friends came home,

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,920
4 of them got pickle.

127
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,440
5th one got us ‘achari paneer’.

128
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
My daughter is 4 years old,

129
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,720
We still have the pickle from their first visit.

130
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,520
My friend went crazy, they started cleaning up post party

131
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,160
I went to the kitchen, one friend was cleaning utensils.

132
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
I wondered what was wrong with him.

133
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,720
He replied “We don’t want to trouble our beloved sister-in-law”

134
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,240
‘Beloved!!!’

135
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,560
This same utensil washing guy,

136
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,080
During a party before pregnancy, came to our house at 11:30 PM.

137
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,200
Brought 4 more single guys with him.

138
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,120
We didn’t even know them.

139
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,920
And then our friend left the party.

140
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,800
At 3 am, only those four guys and I were awake.

141
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,200
And then I realised that those 4 are not even talking to me.

142
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,280
People who don’t have kids can’t realise what a pregnant couple goes through,

143
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,080
Only people who are pregnant around the same time can connect with you.

144
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,200
Experienced parents have forgotten how difficult it was to raise a child.

145
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,480
Old people feel there is no difficulty in raising a child,

146
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,320
According to them, raising a child is as easy as snapping your finger.

147
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,880
Snap again and you have raised the second child.

148
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,440
If you have twins, you need to snap twice

149
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
They were saying anything.

150
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,880
During the 3rd trimester, we were scared about labour pains.

151
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,160
My dad is a doctor, he claimed there are no labour pains.

152
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,680
“What are you even saying?”

153
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,160
He replied “When I was interning at a hospital,

154
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,520
Pregnant ladies would deliver on the way

155
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,920
On their way to the labour room

156
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,480
They would deliver on the train,

157
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,280
They would deliver on the bus,

158
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,200
Some of the were walking towards the hospital and they delivered on the road.”

159
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,160
Did a childbirth ever happen in your hospital?

160
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,200
At least then you would have seen labour pain.

161
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,840
Our relatives would say “Pregnancy is the best time for couples,

162
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,920
It’s even better than honeymoon.”

163
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,560
I wonder what they were doing on their honeymoon?

164
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,200
Pregnancy is not the best time,

165
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,800
I was nervous throughout the pregnancy,

166
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,400
Once I had to calculate 7 multiplied by 4,

167
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,360
I couldn’t remember the answer.

168
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,520
I don’t even remember the table of 7, how can I be a father?

169
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,200
Worst is I couldn’t even remember the table of 4.

170
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,040
Modern couple fight the most over –

171
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,720
What to watch on TV?

172
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,600
Now my wife is pregnant, she had all the control

173
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,560
I put some serious drama, she rejected it saying

174
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,680
“This is too serious, my child is getting sad.”

175
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,040
I changed it to an action movie,

176
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,560
She rejected that too “It has too much violence, it’s impacting my child.”

177
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,640
Now it’s only ‘your’ child.

178
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,800
Isn’t it ‘our’ child?

179
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,160
Next, I put comedy on TV,

180
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,520
She rejected that too, “It’s not making me laugh.”

181
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,880
“It’s my video

182
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,440
Have some shame.”

183
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,640
“I can’t lie to my child.”

184
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,160
Our gynae was the best gynae,

185
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,720
There were some complications in the last trimester,

186
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,000
Everything is fine now, don’t worry.

187
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,720
Our gynae started my wife’s maternity leave one month before delivery,

188
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,160
She would call us for tests during the day.

189
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,960
Now I have a lot of free time,

190
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,080
if she called us during the day, i was there

191
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,600
if she called at night, i was there

192
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,040
I wore shorts whenever she called us

193
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,440
She got concerned after 3-4 appointments,

194
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,240
that I have never seen him wear

195
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,600
So she asked me one day “What do you do?”

196
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,560
I told her “Standup comedy”.

197
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,320
She got even more concerned,

198
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,640
“I hope you can pay the hospital bills.”

199
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,880
“My wife earns a lot, don’t worry.”

200
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,520
The day of delivery, we had a caesarean delivery.

201
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,120
I’m in the operation theatre, my full focus is on wife’s face.

202
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
After our daughter got delivered,

203
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,920
The doctor called me to the other side.

204
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,240
I went to the other side,

205
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,920
My wife’s abdomen was cut open,

206
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,680
The doctor’s is showing me the insides.

207
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,480
See this is your wife’s fallopian tube,

208
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,520
This is your wife’s uterus,

209
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,720
This is your wife’s large intestine.

210
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,600
“What are you trying to achieve with this?”

211
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,360
She replied “Now you can go on stage and say

212
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,440
I have seen my wife’s guts.”

213
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,600
You are thinking of jokes right now?

214
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
Seal up by wife immediately.
