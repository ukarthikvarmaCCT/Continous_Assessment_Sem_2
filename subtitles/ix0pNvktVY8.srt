1
00:00:00,056 --> 00:00:01,746
After finishing the Kerala Boat Race,

2
00:00:01,771 --> 00:00:04,114
I went to my friend's
house in Cochin at night.

3
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:06,292
And took a flight to
Delhi in the morning.

4
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:13,274
One good thing about Cochin
Airport is that there are sofas here.

5
00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:14,923
It's very comfortable.

6
00:00:14,923 --> 00:00:17,909
There are individual sofas
too, unlike any other airport.

7
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:22,625
I start my morning normally like, drink
water, brush my teeth and have tea.

8
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:24,651
But there's one thing
common in all these things.

9
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:26,122
You need water.

10
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:27,649
And the day you don't
have water at home...

11
00:00:29,117 --> 00:00:30,402
Ritu, come upstairs once.

12
00:00:30,402 --> 00:00:32,095
There's not a single
drop of water at home.

13
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:33,318
There were monkeys at night.

14
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:35,500
They broke these water pipes.

15
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:36,584
It's all over.

16
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:37,802
This is our tank.

17
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:39,377
There's a plastic
tanki under it.

18
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:40,469
It's pipe melted completely.

19
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:42,402
It's build like this, I'm
scared to climb up on this.

20
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:43,134
I might slip.

21
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:45,986
Yes, but there's no way to climb up.

22
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:48,684
There is no trick to climb,
how will a man climb?

23
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:50,500
It's completely temporary.

24
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:51,193
Haha

25
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:52,369
Look at this.

26
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:56,666
If a person slips from here,
he will go down by swinging.

27
00:00:56,688 --> 00:00:57,493
Come on i'll hold it.

28
00:00:57,554 --> 00:00:58,969
Even if you slip from above,
you may go straight to the garden.

29
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,946
Haha

30
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:01,308
That's why grass has
been planted below brother.

31
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,384
Hahaha

32
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:06,482
I feel like I've become
an action movie hero.

33
00:01:08,678 --> 00:01:11,302
Brother, finish our work.

34
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:11,986
Please.

35
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:13,352
I didn't even brush my
teeth in the morning.

36
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:17,125
The first plumber who
came here gave up.

37
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,482
Now the second plumber has come.

38
00:01:18,482 --> 00:01:20,482
There's no way to climb up.

39
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:21,482
I'm scared to climb up.

40
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:26,163
I feel like in Mai Hu Na Movie Shahrukh
Khan climb up & done a slidey, just like it.

41
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:26,822
It's scary.

42
00:01:26,898 --> 00:01:29,936
There is not a drop of
water to flush in the toilet.

43
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:31,105
Noni, find Pihu.

44
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,476
Where's Pihu? Where's Pihu?

45
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:34,138
I can't see Pihu.

46
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:35,163
Pihu is hidden.

47
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:36,002
Noni, can you see Pihu?

48
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:36,294
No

49
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:36,966
Can you see her?

50
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:38,221
Where are you Pihu?

51
00:01:38,246 --> 00:01:39,298
Pihu, Pihu, Pihu.

52
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:40,032
She's there.

53
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,028
Where did you see her?

54
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:42,878
I saw Pihu.

55
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,016
Haha

56
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:45,077
Come out.

57
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:46,720
I saw you, I saw you.

58
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:50,977
I have to pick up
Rashi from school now.

59
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:52,209
Yesterday was a cricket match.

60
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:54,078
I was playing well.

61
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:56,222
Look, there's no tension
about the runs right now.

62
00:01:59,444 --> 00:01:59,928
Catch it.

63
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,794
But our match got abandoned
due to some reason.

64
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:18,192
The ball hit the bottom edge
and went through the leg.

65
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:30,250
He was saying
earlier that it's not.

66
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,470
Don't curse.

67
00:02:33,126 --> 00:02:33,725
What's tomorrow?

68
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:34,766
It's our country's birthday.

69
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:35,791
It's our country's birthday tomorrow?

70
00:02:35,843 --> 00:02:36,289
Yes.

71
00:02:36,342 --> 00:02:38,058
Today was your celebration
of Independence Day?

72
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:38,446
Yes.

73
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:39,971
So what did you do at school today?

74
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:41,804
Today we made Indian flag.

75
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:44,301
And? And we...

76
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:45,890
Dad, can I tell you something?

77
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:46,694
Yes, tell me.

78
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,142
Today...

79
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:52,138
Sometimes I get hungry in school.

80
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:55,902
Mummy had given me the tiffin
and had given me the money in it.

81
00:02:55,977 --> 00:02:59,758
Cashew, almond,
chips and butter in this.

82
00:02:59,794 --> 00:03:00,794
Oh, wow.

83
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:03,478
There's no water at all at home.

84
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:04,417
I am saying Ritu, Pihu.

85
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:05,325
Rashi, come on.

86
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:07,978
There's no water
to drink at all.

87
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:09,117
Look at this.

88
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:11,388
Wow, wow.

89
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:12,306
Look, look, look.

90
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:14,600
Brother, it is a matter of great
difficulty, I have got pressure.

91
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,008
But there's no water at
home to relieve the pressure.

92
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:17,966
So what should we do?

93
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:19,226
Should we ask the neighbors?

94
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:20,202
First we bring it from this side.

95
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:21,471
I will bring it, hold this.

96
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:24,560
What do you know about the cost
of 2 buckets of water Ramesh Babu..

97
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:33,026
I've fooled, bro.

98
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:34,167
Our neighbors have gone outside.

99
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:34,817
What will we do?

100
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,064
I think it's better
to say to uncle,

101
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:41,278
I'll do it in your washroom,
till then I can't hold it.

102
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,735
When people from the village
bring water from 5 km away,

103
00:03:57,472 --> 00:03:58,533
How do they bring it?

104
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:00,586
Why water is the dirty?

105
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:01,386
It's coming dirty.

106
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:07,346
Great success.

107
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:09,883
How hard it was to open the new pen.

108
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:10,809
The new pen was in this.

109
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,655
All the pens were opened.

110
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,033
I said, it's broken.

111
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:13,708
It's broken.

112
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:14,453
All the pens.

113
00:04:14,478 --> 00:04:15,217
This is the packet of new pen.

114
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:16,405
All the pens are broken.

115
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,430
And this bangle isn't open.

116
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:19,194
It's broken, brother, look.

117
00:04:19,314 --> 00:04:20,364
It's all broken from one place.

118
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:22,778
We did an economical thing by
taking out the refill and keep it.

119
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:24,849
There is no water at all in our house.

120
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:26,837
So Ritu and I decided that
we are going to the hotel.

121
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:27,811
We will take a bath there.

122
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:28,742
We are going to pretext
of having coffee there.

123
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:30,966
We will take a room
and take a bath.

124
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:32,708
So Nisha's children have
also come to our house.

125
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:36,046
All the kids have to pee today,
when there is no water at home.

126
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:37,328
Brother, it was fun.

127
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:39,444
We went there in
this building it's mall.

128
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,116
We went there and took a bath.

129
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,780
They gave us a gift, Sir, you
took a very good bath here.

130
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:44,676
Great success.

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,484
Dad,

132
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:46,514
First do the studies.

133
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:47,519
Dad, look at this one thing.

134
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:48,951
- Your teacher has come
- Look at it

135
00:04:48,976 --> 00:04:49,544
Show what is it.

136
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,430
Did you teach this to Pihu?

137
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:51,393
Is she was able to run it?

138
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:52,510
She runs it like this.

139
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:54,508
But she collides in this.

140
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,472
Your teacher has
come go n study now.

141
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:57,601
Has the water come,
sister? Has the water come?

142
00:04:57,973 --> 00:05:00,244
What a thing, brother!
let me take a bath.

143
00:05:00,444 --> 00:05:01,375
 Look at them.

144
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,000
When father had said that no child will come to
father's office and not will touch office items.

145
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:06,850
Then what is this happening?

146
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:07,773
What is happening?

147
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,540
Pihu, what's going on?

148
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:10,977
Han?

149
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:13,713
Rashi, ..you're doing here and there
they have made mess in the office.

150
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:15,266
Look, they are making a mess.

151
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:17,146
JAI..

152
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:20,263
I got this specially for
Pihu from Hong Kong.

153
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:22,062
Rashi, hold it. Let me
show you how it looks.

154
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:23,605
One goes down like this.

155
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:24,663
This one goes like this.

156
00:05:24,663 --> 00:05:25,577
And this one goes like this.

157
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,062
Pihu didn't have a bag,
Pihu's shoulder is small..

158
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:29,463
So, you can carry it like this.

159
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,586
I saw in Hong Kong every kid...

160
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:35,904
Our captain is getting
ready for the morning.

161
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:37,418
She's ironing her dress.

162
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:38,578
Which flight is tomorrow?
where are you going tomorrow.

163
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:40,289
Tomorrow, Bombay - Madurai.

164
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:40,985
You're going to Madurai?

165
00:05:41,062 --> 00:05:42,605
There's a really nice
temple in Madurai.

166
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:43,862
It's called Lipakshi, right?

167
00:05:43,862 --> 00:05:45,354
- Do you know what happened yesterday? 
- What happened?

168
00:05:45,463 --> 00:05:48,218
Yesterday, on my flight,
when the crew breifs,

169
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:50,741
The people sitting at the
overwing exit were like,

170
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:55,017
If there's an emergency, the
captain will say, evacuate, evacuate,

171
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:55,981
So, you have to get off.

172
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,631
So, there were a few people.

173
00:05:57,663 --> 00:05:59,530
He got off the flap.

174
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:00,971
- The one who was sitting
- Hmm

175
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:02,020
Came to me.

176
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,463
I sent him.

177
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:05,504
Because he was talking about the crew.

178
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:07,058
- How did he do it?
- Yes

179
00:06:07,263 --> 00:06:10,058
So, the crew said, sir,
this is a punishable offence.

180
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:11,214
You can't do it like this.

181
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:13,084
So, he said, who
would punish me?

182
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:15,150
So, I said, really?

183
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:17,980
So, she said, sir, the
government would punish you.

184
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:19,111
It's a punishable offence.

185
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:20,557
So, he said, I'm the government.

186
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:21,217
Huh?

187
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,438
He said this.

188
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,290
Did Modi was sitting there?

189
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:24,418
No, he didn't.

190
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:25,556
So, what happened next.

191
00:06:25,758 --> 00:06:27,463
The crew came and told me.

192
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:28,862
Okay, ma'am, he was saying this.

193
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:30,878
I said, brother, then call security.

194
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:33,630
So, when the security
came, so, generally,

195
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:36,329
When the security comes,
as they say, get off from here.

196
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:38,052
So, they said,

197
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:40,324
Captain, is very
angry about this.

198
00:06:40,438 --> 00:06:41,712
Do you know what the problem was?

199
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:42,428
Attitude.

200
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:43,153
There was no problem.

201
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:45,864
If that guy says, okay,
ma'am, sorry, I made a mistake.

202
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:47,301
Okay, I won't do it again.

203
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:50,438
I said, if that guy has such an
attitude, that I am the government.

204
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:51,802
I said, he will do it anyway.

205
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:52,685
I said, take him down.

206
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:55,546
So, after that, he
started saying sorry.

207
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,358
Then I said, brother,
make him sit in the front.

208
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:00,320
I made him sit
on the first seat.

209
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:02,412
I said, lead, you take care of him.

210
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:07,470
I said, it's a matter of people
they don't understand seriousness.

211
00:07:07,814 --> 00:07:09,077
All these things
are very important.

212
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,556
I remembered a story.

213
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:12,241
We were about to
land in Hyderabad.

214
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:13,982
So, there were kids.

215
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:16,564
Like, for the first and second
time, they are traveling.

216
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:18,263
So, they were bothering our crew.

217
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:19,161
As in, a little bit,

218
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:20,294
I don't know what term to use.

219
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:23,601
They were hitting a little line or
bothering us them do this and that.

220
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:24,733
They were bothering, basically.

221
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:26,633
So, my crew came and
said, they are bothering us, sir.

222
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:30,236
So, then I announced that, look,
sir, if you will continue to bother us.

223
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,220
Then I will announce this to
the Hyderabad security team.

224
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:35,685
So, they went straight like this.

225
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,634
They said, sir, we are apologizing.

226
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,448
We are sitting in the back.

227
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:39,987
But the line comes.

228
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:41,854
All these things are very legal.

229
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:45,286
And people don't know how
much authority there is in this case.

230
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:49,062
- You can literally be jailed for all these
things so be careful - If the police comes..

231
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:50,009
If the police comes, they will take you.

232
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:50,430
Yes.

233
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:51,681
They will put you in jail.

234
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,900
It doesn't work here.

235
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,263
They say, we're
hitting just a line.

236
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:55,222
So, what?

237
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:58,853
When you are in air, it's a serious
offense in terms of a lot of things.

238
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,570
Tokyo Convention, 1947.

239
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:01,392
Something like this, right?

240
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:03,278
Oh, you remember that.

241
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:06,309
