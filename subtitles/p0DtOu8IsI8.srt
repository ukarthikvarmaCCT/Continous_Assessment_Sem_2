00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:04,497
Hi Friends, today we are going to do the 'English Vinglish' challenge.

2
00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:07,388
Wait a minute, I have heard English but what's Vinglish?

3
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:08,973
I am already weak in English.

4
00:00:08,998 --> 00:00:10,959
And you are doing this challenge so I'm out.

5
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:14,553
Look at your side. Are you forgetting me? I am at your side.

6
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:16,738
Oh right, I have him at my side.

7
00:00:16,772 --> 00:00:19,695
She always makes me lose and yet I am at her side. Very nice.

8
00:00:19,718 --> 00:00:22,463
Alright! Now let's start the game. OK.

9
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:26,570
In today's game, there are 4 rounds with 10 questions in each round.

10
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,011
You can play with us as well.

11
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:30,590
And there is no compulsion for English like she said.

12
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:33,760
If you are not good at English still you can play. It will be fun.

13
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:36,739
And the first round is here on the screen.

14
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,761
What's this? Aayu and few show. Aayu and Pihu show.

15
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:44,685
Right. Oh, this is how the challenge will be.

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,773
We have to make a guess by rhyming the words.

17
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,140
Yes, like this you have to guess. This is "English Vinglish".

18
00:00:50,162 --> 00:00:52,729
Read and guess the word.

19
00:00:52,763 --> 00:00:55,631
So, there will not be any point in this one.

20
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:58,024
Why? Because this was the trial question. Alright!

21
00:00:58,114 --> 00:01:01,551
And here goes round 1. Food. First round is on food.

22
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:05,658
Will there be letters or sentences? You'll see.

23
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:08,459
1st question of 1st round is here.

24
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:12,563
You pressed too soon. Okay, answer quickly.

25
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:18,612
Blue? No. Boe? Day.

26
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:22,228
Time up! Potato chips. You will be given 10 secs only.

27
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:24,739
Why did you buzz first? You want to join Mom's team.

28
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,261
They lost a point. No, no.

29
00:01:27,273 --> 00:01:29,627
Minus 1. No! Why, why didn't you answer?

30
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:32,322
You didn't answer you were only reading.

31
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:39,766
From now, if someone buzzed, they have to answer or minus one point.

32
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:41,987
So, friends are you getting the game?

33
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,529
Boe day tote ships become potato chips.

34
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:50,589
This is really fun. OK now, the next question.

35
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:57,788
Oh no, who buzzed first. I did. It's a cheeseburger. Cheeseburger.

36
00:01:57,866 --> 00:01:58,866
Okay now, next.

37
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:06,125
Ice cream cone.

38
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:11,437
Oh wow. See, I told you I am good at English.

39
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:14,796
Today is my day, and I chose the right team.

40
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:19,890
What will happen to your team, Aayu Pihu? Don't know.

41
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:21,359
Next.

42
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:32,904
"Peanut butter". Oh, very nice.

43
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:35,672
You have to answer before secs or it will not count.

44
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:38,183
Now, their brain has started working. Yes, you are right.

45
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:43,741
Pihu Di's not mine. Yes, mine & Aayu's brain is yet to start.

46
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,040
Don't forget to like the video.

47
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:48,980
OK, next question.

48
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:51,681
Chocolate brownies

49
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:53,389
I buzzed first. No, I buzzed first.

50
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:56,224
OK, Aayu got a point too. Chocolate brownies.

51
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:59,008
Friends, Are you getting it? Keep noting down your scores.

52
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:01,809
And share with us in the end by commenting. Alright.

53
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:04,979
OK, next.

54
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:08,249
He buzzed. Apple Juice.

55
00:03:08,294 --> 00:03:11,777
Is it apple juice?

56
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:17,514
What's this? There are three words. Apple juice.

57
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:21,571
 It can be like this also. It could be anything.

58
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:24,194
You have to guess by speaking the words.

59
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,011
This is why it's called Vinglish. It's Vinglish, not English.

60
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:29,101
OK, next.

61
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:35,675
Cheese pizza. It's already done.

62
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:37,842
Not pizza it was a cheese burger.

63
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:45,233
Mom, at least get us one point. My brain is not working in this game.

64
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:49,005
I am weak in English and you added Vinglish too.

65
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:56,851
Oreo cookie.

66
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,266
I was thinking of winning in Dad's team.

67
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:02,175
You can change teams if you want.

68
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,075
No. It's not worth I will make them lose. They'll not agree.

69
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,485
OK now, next.

70
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:10,414
Right now, I feel like I'm good for nothing.

71
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:11,537
Focus.

72
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,877
Old Bud, old butter. Old butter.

73
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:20,680
Aayu got this. Chole bhature. Old butter.

74
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:24,788
How is this chole bhature?

75
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:28,349
Last time it was in peanut butter.

76
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:32,188
Don't get confused with the last time, it can be anything.

77
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,934
Chole bhature reminded me of the north vs south food video.

78
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:41,169
Relax, relax. We will have chole bhature too don't worry.

79
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,587
OK, next.

80
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:48,669
Paneer tikka. Oh, we got it later.

81
00:04:48,715 --> 00:04:50,757
I was guessing burger tikka.

82
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:54,396
What burger tikka? There is no burger tikka. Thanks for being quiet.

83
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:58,269
I mean you can speak but first, make sure you are right.

84
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:00,028
Got it. We have to get points.

85
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:02,600
Round two is here. Countries.

86
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:06,740
Countries' names are not very familiar.

87
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:10,264
I only know a few countries' names, if it comes then good or else.

88
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:12,642
You didn't study G.K. ? I did but I forgot most of it.

89
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,932
Now, let's move on. But I do know G.K.

90
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:16,983
It's a part of their syllabus what's the big deal. OK

91
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:18,897
OK now, next.

92
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:26,553
I buzzed first. South Korea. I got it too.

93
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:33,116
I challenge you both in this round. Relax Dad.

94
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:36,338
There's going to be a challenge within the challenge. Yes.

95
00:05:36,495 --> 00:05:37,495
Next.

96
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,607
Australia. 

97
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:58,076
Friends from Australia will let us know that they are watching.

98
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:03,154
Friends from respective countries, please do comment.

99
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:04,233
OK, next.

100
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:09,658
Thailand. Why are you so slow, be quick.

101
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:12,529
A tube light takes time to start.

102
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,133
I haven't answered a single question.

103
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:19,213
Friends, it's a record.

104
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,737
I didn't answer even a single question.

105
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:23,432
And she is holding the buzzer like this.

106
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:28,354
Feel like you are alone in this team, I am out.

107
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:30,619
OK, next.

108
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:35,365
Bangladesh. I buzzed first. This time I got it.

109
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:39,018
Aayu also said bang. Bangladesh.

110
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:42,070
We receive a lot of comments from friends in Bangladesh.

111
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,840
There will be a lot of comments from Bangladesh.

112
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,371
Indonesia. This time we buzzed first. OK, they did it first.

113
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:55,058
It means Mom got it too. Now she can keep her hand on the buzzer.

114
00:06:55,118 --> 00:06:58,144
I miss it when I try to buzz.

115
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:02,408
But what's the point in that you are only telling them the answer.

116
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:06,597
 I believe we have friends in Indonesia as well.

117
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:12,515
There is a yeah in every country. Yeah. Yeah.

118
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,073
OK, next question.

119
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,730
South Korea, Africa. South Africa. I said, South Africa.

120
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,450
Mom said south Africa.

121
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:27,828
Thank god, I got us a point.

122
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,465
Friends from south Africa don't forget to like.

123
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:35,582
The jungles in South Africa are amazing. We will visit there sometime.

124
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:40,738
I thought she'll complain about not taking her there.

125
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,140
OK now, next.

126
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:45,328
Ukraine.

127
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,914
You car rain.

128
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:51,973
OK next.

129
00:07:53,922 --> 00:08:00,719
Zimbabwe. You got me scared by buzzing too soon.

130
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:04,547
This one was cool, Zimbabwe

131
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:06,285
OK, next.

132
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,362
Saudi Arabia.

133
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:13,308
You are going to break that buzzer you were so loud. Sorry!

134
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:18,394
Now, they are in the mood to win, why did dad challenge them?

135
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,230
It's always that people who try to be over-smart end up losing.

136
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:26,183
We take back our challenge. No, we accept it again.

137
00:08:29,097 --> 00:08:30,097
West Indies.

138
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:31,925
I pressed the buzzer too.

139
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,855
I didn't even understand.

140
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:39,124
This is a fun challenge. Isn't it friends?

141
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,980
Don't say any thing rubbish. The next round is sports. I am ready.

142
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:47,862
What?

143
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:50,831
We had a team meeting. We want to do it too.

144
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:54,245
Do it. Include us in it too. Yes, after the round.

145
00:08:56,113 --> 00:08:59,808
Alright, we played half of the game and mom took one point.

146
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:06,425
She scored 2 points. There will be comments that I scored 1 point. 2!

147
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,972
Cricket, we pressed the buzzer.

148
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:14,284
We buzzed first. Let me keep my hand here.

149
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,644
Table Tennis! Oh, man! Table Tennis.

150
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:20,940
We buzzed first. No, we buzzed first.

151
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:23,527
You try buzzing first. OK, next.

152
00:09:24,137 --> 00:09:25,137
Basketball.

153
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,745
What happened to Mom?

154
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,862
I am active now.  Mom told me a trick before.

155
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:36,105
Mom is using that trick. I know it's guesswork.

156
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:40,032
No, no. We won't tell you. We will tell you after this round.

157
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,894
Alright, next.

158
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Volleyball!

159
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:46,339
You're thinking after pressing the buzzer. No. No.

160
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:49,800
We are not even taking time to think, we are giving answers quickly.

161
00:09:49,825 --> 00:09:53,628
We buzzed and answered. Yes. Next.

162
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:57,001
We buzzed first. Alright, now answer.

163
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:59,673
They are trapped. Archery.

164
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:03,727
Don't use your brain much. They planned to buzz first.

165
00:10:03,752 --> 00:10:08,790
Not us, him. Yes. It's your team don't point fingers.

166
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:09,673
Make your team understand.

167
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:11,751
If you wouldn't answer, your point would have been deducted.

168
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:15,540
Now Aayu is not saying anything, he is quiet because he been caught.

169
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:19,726
That's the face of one who is caught, he is covering his face.

170
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,999
He is not even showing his face, show your face, don't be shy.

171
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:24,874
He is not even showing me.

172
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,035
Let's move on with the game. We won't till I say so.

173
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:31,265
Computer Sir, continue. Yes.

174
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,930
Wrestling. Wrestling.

175
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,984
What are you doing? Why are you blaming me?

176
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:42,132
What did I do? Aayu takes 4-5 points in every round like this.

177
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:45,827
Just press the buzzer. Yes, so you can say anything.

178
00:10:47,468 --> 00:10:49,148
Answer now. We buzzed.

179
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:53,210
Did you buzz? Yes, should I answer? Yes. Kabbadi.

180
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,062
Don't buzz if you don't know the answer.

181
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:05,765
Its challenge is like we are saying something fast.

182
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:11,609
We're going, the proper way is we are going.

183
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:15,851
We speak in short form. Yes, I had a t-shirt earlier.

184
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,055
It was written on it 'What are you saying?'

185
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:20,971
If you read it together it might sound weird.

186
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:25,023
But it meant What are you saying?

187
00:11:25,672 --> 00:11:28,625
But it was written 'What are you saying?'

188
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,445
It looks like they know English really well which is not true.

189
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:37,617
If it wasn't a sports category, what would we have said.

190
00:11:38,243 --> 00:11:42,523
Scrape dealer. Next.

191
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:45,820
Hide and Seek.

192
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:51,477
What's the trick I don't get it.

193
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:56,344
 Guess from the initials. Use your brain.

194
00:11:56,369 --> 00:12:01,141
Timing is crucial, you can see we are answering so quickly.

195
00:12:01,376 --> 00:12:02,496
Alright, next.

196
00:12:03,997 --> 00:12:08,332
Karate. Yes. None of you got it, still, you pressed the buzzer.

197
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:10,442
Not all three, it's just him.

198
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,254
This mother-son duo are alike.

199
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,918
Aayu and I buzzed, we both didn't know, I thought Piyush will answer.

200
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:18,637
Look at them, they both are alike.

201
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,161
He takes after me.

202
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,934
Their faces match too.

203
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,918
Mine and Pihu's face match as well, tell us in the comment.

204
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:27,623
Whose face matches whom.

205
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:31,693
He has a dimple like Mom. I have a dimple too.

206
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,052
You have it too. Only I don't have it.

207
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:39,552
She had it but she lost it somewhere. She ate it, alright next.

208
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,474
Gymnastics.

209
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,982
Oh, man!

210
00:12:44,717 --> 00:12:45,935
This was good.

211
00:12:46,951 --> 00:12:49,396
Now it's Round 4 Fruits.

212
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,630
We did a fruit challenge and we ate so many fruits.

213
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,193
There's no way there could any fruit beside them.

214
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:59,942
We ate almost every fruit. Let's watch that Fruit challenge once.

215
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:03,973
Alright, I will tell you the trick. What?

216
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:07,606
I won't, I will tell after the challenge. Tell us!

217
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:12,184
Mom recalled all the sports names before the round began. Yes.

218
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,356
So while playing it immediately clicks.

219
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:19,645
Give us 10 seconds. We'll also recall all the fruits. Yes.

220
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:25,629
Orange. Apple, Kiwi, Sapodilla. Avocados.

221
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,660
Did I pronounce it right? Yes. What? Avocados.

222
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:36,035
Avocado. Mom said anaconda earlier. Anaconda. Yes!

223
00:13:36,638 --> 00:13:39,903
First round fruits, here it is.

224
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:47,551
 Watermelon! We said it first. It was very easy.

225
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:49,051
Alright next.

226
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:53,590
Custard Apple, mom buzzed but she didn't know the answer.

227
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:58,504
I buzzed first. We did it. You're buzzing it so quickly.

228
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:03,442
I am not doing it, mom is doing it. Don't do it, Mom, let us play too.

229
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,600
If I know then I will buzz. Yes.

230
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,260
What is this? He was checking the buzzer. Alright next.

231
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:11,950
Dragon Fruit.

232
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:16,403
What? It's there.  Something. Next.

233
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:19,957
Say it. Say it quickly. Pineapple.

234
00:14:19,982 --> 00:14:23,598
He thought and answered he buzzed without knowing. Don't do it.

235
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:27,379
You saw what happened right, next.

236
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:29,371
Guava.

237
00:14:34,144 --> 00:14:36,848
The computer is also calling us to let's go to Goa. What?

238
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:40,457
Let's visit Goa on the computer only, come on.

239
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:44,606
Take us for a trip. We will, but on the computer. Stingy!

240
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:49,832
Every time you say it, why are you playing with me, alright next.

241
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:52,114
Pomegranate.

242
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:59,371
I won't leave it. Obviously. He will buzz, alright next.

243
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:02,182
Strawberry, We buzzed first.

244
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:08,145
 I can see it they both are cheating. Not both. Not Cheating.

245
00:15:08,153 --> 00:15:11,426
It's not cheating, we are answering. You do it. Yes!

246
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:18,595
Dad does that every time. I will, I will change the game next time.

247
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,408
What? Next.

248
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:24,259
Muskmelon. Mom buzzed first. I did it.

249
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:27,619
She banged it. We have to win.

250
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,096
Yes. My reputation is on the line, and my English is well.

251
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:38,197
You laughed as well, alright, next. Yes.

252
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:44,150
I was just... It wasn't here. It won't count.

253
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:48,572
Minus 1. No! You buzzed too, both will get minus one.

254
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,806
There are tears in my eyes.

255
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:55,923
I didn't buzz, my hand wasn't even there.

256
00:15:56,767 --> 00:16:00,072
In this respect also Pihu and Dad are alike.

257
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:01,994
They both get tears while laughing.

258
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,212
Alright next.

259
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:11,056
Who buzzed? We both buzzed, we don't know the answer.

260
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:15,330
Aayu buzzed. But I buzzed too.

261
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:20,790
Avocados. I said it at the start. It's an anaconda.

262
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:22,673
Did you get it? No.

263
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:26,509
No, I didn't get it, we still buzzed.

264
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:29,970
It happened two times that we are caught cheating.

265
00:16:29,986 --> 00:16:34,267
Next time, no buzzer, these are pointless.

266
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,884
Say it. Capricorn.  What is Capricorn?

267
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,454
Which fruit is that? I will tell Capricot! Capricot.

268
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,220
What is capricot? Apricot.

269
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:50,852
Apricot. You said capricot.

270
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:57,345
Challenge over, It's finished. Capsicum.

271
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:59,298
There's a special round.

272
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:02,866
The one who wins the special round is the final winner.

273
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:08,165
Subscribe. Like Share. No. subscribe.

274
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:14,532
Subscribe to my channel. Do it quickly.

275
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:16,301
This was good.

276
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,907
We won! You just won by one point.

277
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:22,899
This mother-son duo cheated a lot, so we don't know.

278
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:26,321
I hope you enjoyed the video and laughed.

279
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:29,540
You can also play this challenge with your friends.

280
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:34,906
If not on a laptop, you can play it on paper with your friends.

281
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:39,429
See you in the next episode till then. Bye!
