00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:14,097
O' Lord, when I came to this house,

2
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:18,335
I had imagined I'd leave
this house only after dying.

3
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:21,305
But the circumstances
and my fate have compelled me

4
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:23,711
to leave this house.

5
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:30,004
I can't bear the heir to this family.

6
00:00:31,918 --> 00:00:33,346
But it is my duty

7
00:00:34,303 --> 00:00:35,631
to ensure the happiness of this family.

8
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:39,869
I have no option but to leave this house.

9
00:00:50,252 --> 00:00:52,502
Take care of Vinayak, O' Lord.

10
00:00:54,627 --> 00:00:56,960
Make sure he never misses me.

11
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:03,293
And ensure Maya gets every joy in life.

12
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,168
She should get whatever she wants.

13
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:08,720
In order to give this family its heir

14
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:13,053
Siddhi will make the sacrifice
and not Maya.

18
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,020
O' Goddess, You know

19
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:01,942
that I have no bad intentions
or malice in my heart.

20
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:05,835
I have left the house.

21
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:08,918
But I am clueless as to
where I am going to go.

22
00:03:10,543 --> 00:03:13,201
I am facing this dilemma
of relationship and life.

23
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:17,021
I see no future for myself.

24
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:20,542
Show me a way, O' Goddess.

25
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:22,812
Help me.

26
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:26,317
Take me under Your shelter.

Thank you.

Careful, my dear.

34
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:39,927
You should not stand up suddenly
in this condition.

35
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:42,625
You must be even more careful now.

36
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,514
Why? What's wrong with me?

37
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:47,543
You are pregnant.

38
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:48,918
I am pregnant?

39
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:04,377
No. How is this possible?

40
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,735
Why are you saying so?

41
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:08,918
You should be happy and not shocked

42
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:10,862
for the Goddess has blessed you.

43
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:16,252
But the reports clearly stated
that I can never conceive.

44
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,418
So how can you be sure of it?

45
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:21,877
Doctors are humans too.

46
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,168
They are not greater than God.

47
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:27,433
Before giving you joy,

48
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,085
the Goddess tests
her devotee's faith at times.

I have years of experience.

52
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,628
I knew the moment I read your pulse

53
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,585
that you are pregnant.

54
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:57,446
Indeed, you are no lesser
than a Goddess for me.

55
00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:58,710
Bless you, dear.

In this selfish world,

to be your own is so.

I am not accusing you.

I just want to know the truth

as to why you lied to me.

you can never conceive a baby.

Please tell me.

to make the fake reports.

Yes, your husband asked me
to make fake reports.

You are lying, aren't you?

101
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:18,418
Why don't you ask him why he did that?

102
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:22,960
But the truth is that your husband met
me personally to discuss this matter.

103
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:27,937
And he paid me
one lakh rupees for the fake report.

104
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:34,085
This can't be.

105
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,002
Vinayak can never do that.

106
00:08:37,752 --> 00:08:39,168
What proof do you have?

107
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:41,127
Tell me. What proof do you have?

108
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,585
I have the proof.

109
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:47,168
This is the CCTV footage from my cabin.

110

See it for yourself.

Yes, your husband asked me
to make fake reports

112
00:09:17,972 --> 00:09:19,821
He was the one who told me

to lie to everyone.

114

And he paid me
one lakh rupees for the fake report.

How could you stoop so low, Siddhi?

116
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:42,168
How can you doubt your husband Vinayak?'

117
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:48,835
The Vinayak who stood up for you.

118
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:53,502
The Vinayak, whose love changed your life.

119
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:55,525
You are mistaken, Siddhi.

120
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:58,346
Vinayak has just betrayed you.

121

He faked loving you and then married you.

122
00:10:04,307 --> 00:10:08,127
Then he put the crown of thorns on you
and threw you out of the house.

123

If there is someone
who has made a mockery of your life

then it's only Vinayak.

Vinayak loves you.

127
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:35,960
And he has proved it a number of times.

128
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,293
Maybe.

129
00:10:37,377 --> 00:10:40,877
But Siddhi, if he can betray you once,

130
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,299
he can betray you again.

131
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:46,918
His love is fake.

132
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:48,839
It is not true.

133
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:58,168

if you leave the house.

135

I must meet and talk to Vinayak.

136
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:28,335
I will talk to Vinayak

137
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:33,127
and find out the entire truth
no matter what.

You are not answering my calls
or replying to my messages.

I have been looking for you like crazy.

142
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,918
Where are you?
And where did you go without informing?

143

I want to meet you.

144
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,002
But not at home.

get broken.

154
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,210
I knew the moment I read your pulse
that you are pregnant.

155
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:59,138
Why are you standing far from me, Vinayak?

156

What's the matter?

157
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,101
Aren't you happy to see me?

158
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:18,520
I am going to ask you something.

159
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:21,116
If you've ever loved me truly,

160
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:24,600
swear to it

161
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:31,123
and give me an honest answer
to the question I ask.

162
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:36,504
Is it true

163
00:13:38,219 --> 00:13:41,591
that you told the doctor
to make the fake report?

164
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:48,127
What rubbish!

165
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:50,335
Why would I make my wife's fake reports?

166
00:13:50,418 --> 00:13:53,502
Before you say anything
let me tell you

167
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:57,749
that I have seen the CCTV footage.

168
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:06,416
I saw you paying the doctor
to make the reports.

169
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:13,793
I just want to hear it from you.

170
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:16,404
Say that it is a lie.

171
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:20,217
I will think that my eyes lied to me
and forget it.

172
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:26,630
Vinayak, look into my eyes

173
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:32,752
and say that you did not betray me.

174
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:39,230
You are my wife, Siddhi.

175
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:41,680
I have married you.

176
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:45,043
How can I lie to you?

177
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:09,824
Why are you laughing, Vinayak?

178
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:11,522
You want the truth, right?

179
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,682
So here it is.

180
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:15,805
Yes, I made those fake reports.

181
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,052
I paid that doctor

182
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,900
so that my family thinks
that you are infertile.

183
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:35,900
And you can't give it an heir.

184
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:39,510
The CCTV footage is also real.

185
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:43,527
And what the doctor said is also true.

186
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:53,927
And it is also true
that my dark-skinned wife...

187
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,427
Oh, I'm sorry.

188
00:15:56,885 --> 00:15:59,635
I wanted to get rid of
my very dark-skinned wife.

189
00:16:02,218 --> 00:16:03,968
It's simple.

190
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:07,385
Why would Vinayak Pandey

191
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,385
who is every girl's dream man
love a dark-skinned girl like you?

192
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:15,098
Hence, I want to get rid of you.

193
00:16:17,385 --> 00:16:18,802
And there is an even greater truth.

194
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,114
Do you want to hear it?

195
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:24,347
Tell me. You'll be devastated if I say it.

196
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:25,926
So what?

197
00:16:26,007 --> 00:16:27,840
You want the truth, right?

198
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:29,853
So here it is.

199
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:34,738
I love your sister, Maya, and not you.

200
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:49,180
Maya is my first love and my life.

201
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:50,972
And Maya is someone

202
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:56,972
who matches Vinayak Pandey's
class and stature.

203
00:16:57,263 --> 00:17:02,430
And Maya should have been
Vinayak Pandey's actual choice.

204
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,138
And you...

205
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,310
You are the mistake
I am going to rectify very soon.

206
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:14,513
And Maya and I...

207
00:17:14,597 --> 00:17:15,930
Enough!

208
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:27,048
Don't you dare even utter
my sister's name.

209
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:30,524
I am ashamed of myself

210
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:33,138
for I made the mistake
of falling in love

211
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:35,088
with a disgusting man like you.

212
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:39,259
I thought I was wise.

213
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:44,513
But I am so dumb for
I fell for what you said.

214
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,805
What's done is done.

215
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,493
But I will not let my sister go through
what I've been through.

216
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,972
I know you will bewitch my sister too.

217
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:55,628
You will pretend to love her

218
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:59,472
and then ditch her too.

219
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:03,638
But I will not let anything of
that sort happen to my naive sister.

220
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:06,805
I will expose you.

221
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:08,430
I will tell your family
how disgusting

222
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:11,138
and loathsome a human being you are.

223
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,347
My bad.

224
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:19,421
Calling you a human being
is a disgrace to mankind.

225
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:30,933
Leave my hand.

226
00:18:31,013 --> 00:18:32,436
You will expose me

227
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:35,055
only if you stay alive, right?

228
00:19:07,403 --> 00:19:08,720
You have nowhere to go.

229
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:11,597
Ever since you have come into my life,

230
00:19:11,763 --> 00:19:13,430
my life has become miserable.

231
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:16,888
Now that you know the truth,
you have made my job easier.

232
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:19,680
Now I have no option

233
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:22,722
but to get rid of
a dark-skinned wife like you.

234
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:19,198
Don't worry.

235
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:22,115
Siddhi's dead.

236
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:24,504
She is not coming back.

237
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,069
Maya is so wise.

238
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:46,565
She fears no one.

239
00:22:47,391 --> 00:22:49,605
But she never gets angry.

240
00:22:49,688 --> 00:22:51,510
Siddhi is her sister so true.

241
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,980
I can't live without you.

242
00:23:21,397 --> 00:23:22,688
Well done, Vinayak.

243
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:23,901
Oh, come on.

244
00:23:24,307 --> 00:23:26,147
At least you don't call me Vinayak.

245
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:03,706
The mask maker is brilliant.

246
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:05,333
So was your acting.

247
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:12,317
The moment you changed
your voice and mannerisms,

248
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,071
the circumstances changed too.

249
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:17,105
Now Vinayak has killed Siddhi
in the eyes of the world.

250
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,825
So no one's going
to find out about our plan.

251
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:31,897
Did Siddhi recognise me?

252
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,523
Are you sure she thought I was Vinayak?

253
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:37,251
Let alone Siddhi.

254
00:24:37,605 --> 00:24:40,105
No one can recognise you in this mask

255
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,009
that you are Tanmay and not Vinayak.

256
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,042
Your idea of the mask was quite something.

257
00:24:46,605 --> 00:24:47,688
You are quite smart

258
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:50,018
and also possessive about your plan.

259
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,105
You got me out of jail

260
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,629
so that you can use me
to do these things.

261
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,063
Use?

262
00:24:57,884 --> 00:24:59,384
This word runs the show.

263
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,063
You have been of some use to me

264
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:03,836
and I have been of use to you.

265
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:04,938
Right.

266
00:25:05,313 --> 00:25:07,647
By the way, what's the plan now?

267
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,063
Have some patience.

268
00:25:09,397 --> 00:25:12,063
I am yet to weave my magic.

269
00:25:12,688 --> 00:25:13,980
Just sit back and enjoy.

270
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:20,647
Fine. Send me your location.

271
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:21,897
I am coming.

272
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,855
'The person I am going to send'

273
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,313
'will go meet Siddhi and not Vinayak.'

274
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,397
Your plan was amazing, Maya.

275
00:25:35,688 --> 00:25:37,802
You managed to convince Vinayak

276
00:25:38,112 --> 00:25:39,367
that Siddhi is jealous of him.

277
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:41,037
And then me too.

278
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:46,404
Siddhi.

279
00:25:58,716 --> 00:25:59,730
Siddhi.

280
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:02,148
Vinayak.

281
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:04,428
Vinayak! Vinayak!

282
00:26:06,105 --> 00:26:08,523
- Vinayak, Siddhi...
- Maya.

283
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:09,647
Tell me. What happened to Siddhi?

284
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,063
Siddhi, she... She...

285
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:16,221
Siddhi committed suicide.

286
00:26:23,105 --> 00:26:26,230
Siddhi jumped off the cliff.

287
00:26:27,394 --> 00:26:29,824
And I couldn't even save her.

288
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:34,480
She couldn't have children.

289
00:26:34,688 --> 00:26:35,741
So she...

290
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,647
Vinayak...

291
00:26:40,147 --> 00:26:42,630
No, this can't be. Siddhi cannot leave me.

292
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:44,230
This can't be.

293
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:46,147
Siddhi...

294
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,628
Siddhi, please!

295
00:27:17,063 --> 00:27:18,647
No. No, Siddhi.

296
00:27:21,313 --> 00:27:23,855
You can't leave me.

297
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,480
'Siddhi is dead, Vinayak.'

298
00:27:36,563 --> 00:27:40,614
'Now no one can stop me
from making you mine.'

299
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:49,605
'I will go down in history
as the most treacherous sister.'

300
00:27:49,706 --> 00:27:53,126
'But as they say.
Everything is fair in love and war.'
